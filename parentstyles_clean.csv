The role of perceived parenting styles in thinking styles,2014,"The main objective of this  was to explore the relationships between   and thinking  after controlling for students' gender, academic major, and socioeconomic status. Three hundred and forty-one university students from mainland China responded to the Thinking Style Inventory - Revised II and the  Style Index, and provided a range of demographic information. Results indicated that the dimension of al acceptance/involvement was positively associated with students' creativity-generating  (known as Type I thinking ) and  that could be either creativity-generating or norm-conforming (known as Type III thinking ). Moreover, in terms of the specific types of  , students who perceived their s as using the neglectful   had significantly lower scores in Type I thinking  than students who perceived their s as using the other three   (authoritative, authoritarian, and indulgent). Implications and limitations of this  were discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Attachment Styles, Parenting Styles, and Depression",2017,"The   aims to examine the relationship between attachment ,   of students' s, and students' depression. One hundred and twenty-two university students were selected through random sampling from a total population of 845 graduate students at Zanjan University and were given the Diana Baumrind  Style and Collins and Reid Attachment Style (RAAS) questionnaires and the Beck Depression Inventory. The  of the  demonstrated a significant, negative relationship between s' authoritative   and students' depression; a similar pattern was  seen between secure and ambivalent s' attachment  and students' depression. On the other hand, there was a positive and significant relationship between s' permissive and authoritarian   and students' depression. There was  a positive and significant relationship between s' avoidant attachment and students' depression."
The Impact of Parenting Styles on Subsequent Parenting Styles in Sons,,"Research indicates that there is continuity in both maladaptive ( Chen & Kaplan, 2004) and positive  from one generation to the next. Within the topic of , intergenerational transmission of specific  , specifically, the intergenerational transmission of authoritarian, permissive, and authoritative   has received limited attention in the . In addition, few ers have examined the impact of   applied to specific family members. As such, this  examined whether certain types of   may be passed down from  to son. Through an online questionnaire, (N = 28) men indicated, retrospectively, how they were ed and how they raise (or would raise) their . The  of this  indicate a positive correlation between sons being ed in an authoritarian or permissive manner and subsequent engagement in the same  ."
Reading Processes and Parenting Styles,2016,"Home literacy environment explains between 12 and 18.5 % of the variance of 's language skills. Although most authors agree that  whose s encourage them to read tend to develop better and earlier reading skills, some authors consider that the impact of family environment in reading skills is overvalued. Probably, other variables of - relationship, like  , might be relevant for this field. Nevertheless, no previous studies on the effect of   in literacy have been found. To analyze the role of   in the reading processes of . Children's perceptions of   contribute significantly to the explanation of statistical variance of 's reading processes. 110  (67 boys and 43 girls), aged between 7 and 11 years (M 9.22 and SD 1.14) from Portuguese schools answered to a socio-demographic questionnaire. To assess reading processes it was administered the Portuguese adaptation (Figueira et al. in press) of Bateria de Avalia double dagger o dos Processos Leitores-Revista (PROLEC-R). To assess the   Egna Minnen av Barndoms Uppfostran-s (EMBU-P) and EMBU-C ( version) were administered. According to multiple hierarchical linear regressions, individual factors contribute to explain all reading tests of PROLEC-R, while family factors contribute to explain most of these tests. Regarding  ,  evidence the explanatory power about grammatical structures, sentence comprehension and listening.   have an important role in the explanation of higher reading processes (syntactic and semantic) but not in lexical processes, focused by main theories concerning dyslexia."
"Parenting styles, parenting stress, and behavioral outcomes in  with autism",2021,"Being in a caregiver role for a  with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) brings a unique set of stressors and challenges to the entire family unit. This  examined a model hypothesizing that (a)  stress and the   used by the s of a  with ASD are correlated; (b) ASD severity,  stress, and   uniquely explain the variance in the ation of internalizing and externalizing symptoms among  with ASD; and (c)   moderates the association between ASD severity and the ation of internalizing and externalizing behaviors after controlling for specific demographic variables. A group of online participants were recruited through personal contacts, social media, and Amazon's Mechanical Turk. The group of subjects, made up of 70 primary caregivers of  ages 3 to 18 years diagnosed with ASD, completed a self-report measure. Statistical analyses revealed that ASD severity and   contributed to externalizing behaviors but did not have a significant impact on internalizing behaviors.  stress was the primary predictor of both internalizing and externalizing  behaviors.   was not related to the stress level of s of  with ASD and was not found to moderate the relationship between ASD severity and internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Implications for future  and clinical practice are discussed, highlighting the importance of reducing  stress and providing  training to promote positive   for  with ASD."

"Parenting Styles, Food Parenting Practices and Dietary Intakes of Preschoolers",2021,"Previous evidence suggests that 's eating behaviors were largely influenced by the  and home eating structure. This  examined the relationship between   (including authoritative, authoritarian, indulgent, and uninvolved), food  practices (within Structure, Coercive Control, and Autonomy Support constructs) and dietary intakes of preschoolers. Children aged 3-5 years and their s were recruited from preschools/daycare centers and s completed the surveys (n = 166). Dietary intakes were collected using the Harvard Service Food Frequency Questionnaire (HSFFQ),   was assessed using the  Dimensions Inventory-Short Version (PDI-S), and food  practices were measured using Comprehensive Home Environment Survey (CHES). The  showed that food  practices had a higher number of specific significant findings on 's nutrient and food group intakes than  . Correlation analyses showed positive  practices within Structure were significantly related to healthier 's intakes (e.g., vegetables, iron, and folate) and less unhealthy dietary intakes (e.g., sweets and total fats). Regression models show that  with authoritative s consumed more fruits compared to  with authoritarian s and indulgent s. The  addressed the importance of al influences for preschoolers' healthy dietary intakes, which suggested that future interventions and educational programs could enhance  practices to impact  diet."
Effect of Parenting Style on Adolescent Depression,2022,"  refers to the attitudes and behaviors of s toward their  and an emotional environment in which the s' behaviors are expressed. Behavioral problems including externalizing and internalizing problems are amongst the most common mental health issues. Thus, to prevent the development of depression, it is necessary to understand the  . Objective: To determine the   of s of depressed adolescents. Study Design: Cross-sectional descriptive . Place and Duration of Study: Child & Adolescent Unit, Institute of Psychiatry, Benazir Bhutto Hospital Rawalpindi from 31st January to 31st July 2020. Methodology: One hundred and fifty adolescents were enrolled. The presence of depression in adolescent patients was assessed by using the Hamilton Scale for Depression (HAM-D). For  , the adolescent patients were asked to answer the al Authority Questionnaire. Results: Mean age was 15.90 +/- 2.82 years. 53 (35.3%) were male adolescents and 97 (64.7%) were female adolescents. Twenty two (14.7%), 75 (50%) and 53 (35.3%) patients had mild, moderate and severe depression. Eighty five (56.7%), 50 (33.3%) and 15 (10%) had authoritarian, permissive and authoritative   respectively. Conclusion: The  reveals strong relation between depression and impaired  and emphasizes that s should have warm and nurturing relationship with their  as it provides protection against the development of depression in adolescents."
"Relation of parenting  abuse based on attachment styles, parenting styles, and parental addictions",,"The purpose of this  was to complete the cycle of recognizing these relationships. In this regard, the effect of  , attachment , and the mediating variable of addiction was investigated on  abuse (CA). Multi-stage random sampling and sample size were selected based on the sample size estimation software (510 people) and according to the 20% probability of a drop in the number of subjects, 530 people (265 boys and 265 girls) and 1060 s were selected. The available method was selected from a sample of 530 people who were selected based on the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) and answered Baumrind's  Styles Questionnaire (PSQ), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), and Adult Attachment Scale (AAS). Data were assessed by analysis of variance, mediator analysis, and path analysis. The  showed that differences in   cause differences in their attachment . The  supported only the relationship between the two components of al affection and control with the attachment avoidance index, and no relationship was observed between these components and the anxiety index. Perceived emotional abuse, mediates the relationship between al  components and the  attachment avoidance index. Finally, it was achieved to a model that shows how the two factors of affection and control simultaneously affect the avoidance index, mediated by al addiction."
Is parenting style a context for smoking-specific parenting practices?,2007,"This  examined whether global   can be regarded as a context in which smoking-specific  practices relate to adolescent smoking cognitions and behaviors. Data were gathered through self-administered questionnaires from 482 adolescents aged 12-19 years, who participated in the Study of Medical Information and Life in Eindhoven (SMILE). We assessed   dimensions (support, strict control, psychological control), smoking-specific  practices (- communication about smoking, anti-smoking house rules, availability of tobacco products, non-smoking agreement), smoking-related cognitions according to the I-Change Model (attitude, social norm, self-efficacy, intention), and smoking behavior. Structural equation models were computed and compared for adolescents in different  climates. Results showed that communication and availability were related to adolescents' attitude towards smoking. Availability was additionally associated with reduced self-efficacy to refrain from smoking. Attitude and self-efficacy were subsequently related to intention to smoke, which in turn was related to smoking behavior. No direct relations were found between anti-smoking  practices and adolescent smoking behavior. These  were not dependent on the  climate.   thus did not serve as a context for smoking-specific  practices, indicating that these facets of  operate independently, and that anti-smoking  practices may be effective regardless of  climate.

Parenting styles and bullying involvement,2014,"The   was conducted to explore the relationship between bullying and   in an incidental sample of 626 high school students (49.7% girls). The information was collected by means of a self-report questionnaire that contained two instruments: European Bullying Intervention Project Questionnaire and Scale for the assessment of the   of mothers and fathers of adolescents. The  show statistically significant differences in the perception of   between the students involved and not involved in bullying and between the different kinds of involvement. Different dimensions of   are  categorized as being risk or protective factors of bullying involvement. In agreement with the previous , we have specifically found that perception of   (especially behavioural control and affection and communication) is significantly related to bullying involvement, especially regarding the role of aggressor."
Parenting Styles and Adjustment in Gifted Children,2017,"The   examined the relationship between   and the psychosocial adjustment of 48  aged 7 to 11 years, each of whom had been identified as gifted on the basis of a score of 130 or above on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition.   and  psychosocial adjustment were measured using self-report questionnaires. Nineteen of the 48 gifted  in the sample (39.6%) were described by their s as having peer social problems, descriptions that were not consistent with  obtained from the  and their teachers. Mothers  reported more  conduct problems than did the teachers. No associations were found between   and social problems with peers. Although the findings supported existing  on fathers'  , some of the relationships between mothers'   and gifted  outcomes were not consistent with previous studies on  ."
Parenting Styles and Home Obesogenic Environments,2012," behaviors are known to have a major impact on hood obesity but it has proven difficult to isolate the specific mechanism of influence. The   uses Baumrind's  typologies (authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive) to examine associations between   and  practices associated with hood obesity. Data were collected from a diverse sample of  (n = 182, ages 7-10) in an urban school district in the United States.  behaviors were assessed with the  Styles and Dimension Questionnaire (PSDQ), a 58-item survey that categorizes  practices into three : authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive.  perceptions of the home obesogenic environment were assessed with the Family Nutrition and Physical Activity (FNPA) instrument, a simple 10 item instrument that has been shown in previous  to predict risk for overweight. Cluster analyses were used to identify patterns in the PSDQ data and these clusters were related to FNPA scores and measured BMI values in  (using ANCOVA analyses that controlled for  income and education) to examine the impact of   on risk of overweight/obesity. The FNPA score was positively (and significantly) associated with scores on the authoritative  scale (r = 0.29) but negatively (and significantly) associated with scores on the authoritarian scale (r = -0.22) and permissive scale (r = -0.20). Permissive  was significantly associated with BMIz score but this is the only dimension that exhibited a relationship with BMI. A three-cluster solution explained 40.5% of the total variance and clusters were distinguishable by low and high z-scores on different PSDQ sub-dimensions. A cluster characterized as Permissive/Authoritarian (Cluster 2) had significantly lower FNPA scores (more obesogenic) than clusters characterized as Authoritative (Cluster 1) or Authoritarian/Authoritative (Cluster 3) after controlling for family income and  education. No direct effects of cluster were evident on the BMI outcomes but the patterns were consistent with the FNPA outcomes. The  suggest that a permissive   is associated with more obesogenic environments while an authoritative   is associated with less obesogenic environments."
Ownership Versus Partnership Parenting: Parenting Styles Within the Homeschooling Movement,,"Scholars of the family agree on four main  , varying along two axes: responsiveness and control. al involvement and  autonomy fall under the control axis and are assumed to have an inverse relationship; where al involvement is high,  autonomy is assumed to be low, and vice versa. Drawing on 22 in-depth interviews and participant observation at five homeschooling conferences, we examine the dominant  philosophies and practices of conservative Christian homeschoolers (which we call ownership ) and secular unschoolers (which we call partnership ). We demonstrate that the inverse relationship between al involvement and  autonomy is not  in partnership , which is marked by both high al involvement and high  autonomy. Unschooling thus res an empirical case against the theoretical conflation of al involvement and  autonomy; a new expanded typology is thus posited that divides the control axis into two distinct axes."
Risky Play and Parenting Styles,2016,"This  investigated the predictive power of   towards  and demographic characteristics on 's risky play. 890 s of 4-6 year-old  enrolled in public preschools and kindergartens in Denizli, Turkey completed the questionnaires related to demographic characteristics of themselves and their , their thoughts about risky play and  attitudes towards . Results indicated that   and gender, education level and number of  are significant predictors of s' thoughts about practices and benefits of risky play. In particular, overprotective and permissive  predicted s' practices of risky play while overprotective, permissive and democratic   influenced their thoughts about the benefits of this play."
Perceived parenting styles and primary attachment styles of single and  living with both parents,2021,"Objective: To investigate the association between perceived primary   and attachment  between single-  and  living with both s. Methods: The correlational  was conducted at the Lahore Garrison University, Lahore, Pakistan, from September 2017 to March 2018, and comprised an equal number of  from single- families and those living with both the s. Data was collected using the al authority questionnaire and the Urdu version of the inventory of al and peer attachment. Data was analysed using SPSS 21. Results: Of the 200 , 100(50%) were in each of the two groups, and both the groups had 50(50%) girls and boys each. The overall mean age of the sample was 14.56 +/- 3.03 years (range: 11-18 years). There was a significant negative correlation between permissive   with mother's communication (p<0.05); authoritarian   had negative correlation with al communication and trust(p<0.001). Authoritative  had significant positive relationship with trust (p<0.001), and communication with s (p<0.001), and there was negative relationship between authoritative  with feeling alienated from s (p<0.01). Single-  perceived their s as authoritarian (p<0.001) and had more alienated attachment with s (p<0.001), whereas  living with both the s had more trust (p<0.001) and had better communication with their s (p<0.001). Conclusion: It is important to understand the role of s and different   in building up strong - attachment."
Eating disorder symptoms and parenting styles,2010,"This  aimed to examine associations between symptoms of eating disorders and  , in a non-clinical sample. One hundred and five mothers completed self-report measures of eating disorder symptoms and  . Higher levels of eating disorder symptoms were associated with more authoritarian and permissive  . Authoritative  was not significantly related to eating disorder symptoms. The findings demonstrate that eating disorder symptoms in non-clinical individuals are related to less adaptive  . These findings have potential implications for clinicians working with mothers with eating disorders. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Parenting style and adolescent smoking,2002,"To investigate whether   is an independent risk factor of smoking initiation and experimentation among adolescents, and whether there is a relationship between   and readiness to quit, or nicotine dependence among smokers. Methods: The 84-item Health and Smoking Questionnaire, which assesses demographics, smoking status and smoking history, perceptions of risk and risk reduction, risk factors for tobacco use, and  , was administered to 816 adolescents in grades 7 to 12 (mean age, 15.1 years) of whom 22.6% (n = 182) were smokers.   was measured by the brief, nonretrospective version of the Family of Origin Scale (FOS). Higher scores on the FOS indicated more positive perceived   with high levels of intimacy and autonomy, characteristics of healthy - relationships. Data were analyzed using a model-building approach to logistic regression with demographic and other psychosocial variables in the first two steps, and with   as the last step. Results: Results from two logistic regression models indicate that although   is not a significant risk factor for smoking experimentation [odds ratio (OR) = .998; confidence interval (CI) = .977-1.019; p = .820], it is a significant independent risk factor for smoking initiation (OR = .950; CI = .930-.970; p = .000). Smokers who were more ready to quit had higher   scores than those who were not ready to quit, and smokers who had made a serious quit attempt (an indicator of nicotine addiction) had higher   scores than those who had not made a quit attempt. Moreover, nonsmokers who reported they would smoke a cigarette if their best friend offered had significantly lower   scores than those who reported they would not smoke a cigarette. Conclusions: Additional  on   and its impact on adolescent smoking with a more economically and ethnically diverse sample is warranted. If future  confirms the strength of the relationship between   and adolescent smoking, teaching positive , including facilitating intimate yet autonomous relationships, may be considered as part of smoking prevention and cessation programs.

Parenting style and adolescent fruit consumption,2003,"The importance of the social environment for dietary behaviour has been highlighted in the past decade. A type of environmental influence that has received increasing  attention in recent years is the influence that s can have on their 's dietary behaviour through food-related  practices. Much of the work done so far, however, has reported inconsistent findings and poorly understood mechanisms of influence. The   aimed to explore the possible environmental influence of general   on adolescent food choice patterns. Data were collected at schools (N = 643; mean age 16.5 years), using self-administered questionnaires on  . fruit intake behaviour and fruit-specific cognitions. Consistent and theoretically predictable differences were found between adolescents who described their s as authoritative, authoritarian, indulgent or neglectful. Fruit consumption and fruit-specific cognitions were most favourable among adolescents who were being raised with an authoritative  . Children of s with indulgent   consumed more fruit than adolescents from authoritarian or neglectful homes. Consequences of these  for the interpretation of earlier studies on the influence of  practices are discussed, and a  model is proposed for future studies of al influences on adolescent dietary behaviours.

PARENTING STYLE AMONG CHILDREN WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY,2020," is a factor that is directly related to  development. This  aims to explore the   among  with developmental delay. This qualitative  nested in a Child Growth and Development Cohort Study that was conducted in Bogor in October 2019. Six  aged 2 to 6 years with developmental delay were recruited in this . Mother of these  were purposely selected as informants and participated in individual interview about  Style of Baurimnd. The mothers as the main caregiver of their  applied control and warmth . The mothers did not know if their  suffered from developmental delay and they had never been informed about this problem by health workers. Economic factors were the reason why mother did not check up their  development. Family had an important role to prevent developmental delay of their . s did not realize that their  had developmental delay, thus there was no specific   applied to cope with this problem. Early detection and early developmental stimulation for  are necessary. It is important to develop indirect counselling media, both electronic and printed media, for mothers of  with developmental delay; hence they can perform early detection and early developmental stimulation by themselves."
"Parenting styles, cyberaggression, and cybervictimization among adolescents",2019,"Social concern about the negative effects of cyberbullying in  and adolescents' psychosocial development is currently increasing. The importance of the family environment and factors in bullying has been highlighted, but little is known about the role of   in adolescents' engagement in cyberaggression and cybervictimization. The aim of this  was to analyze the relationships of   (authoritative, indulgent, authoritarian, and neglectful) and cyberbullying (cybervictimization and cyberaggression) in adolescents,  considering sex and age. Participants were 2399 Spanish adolescents, 50.2% boys, aged between 12 and 18 years old (M-age = 14.69, SDage = 1.82). A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA, 4 x 2 x 2) was performed, with  , sex, and age (12-14 years and 15-18 years) as independent variables and cybervictimization and cyberaggression as criteria. Possible interaction effects were  analyzed. Results showed main effects of  , sex, and age, as well as an interaction effect between sex and  . Girls suffered more cybervictimization than boys, whereas boys performed higher levels of cyberaggression than girls. Results suggested that authoritarian   was a risk factor for cyberviolence. Girls from authoritarian families scored highest on cybervictimization. Boys from indulgent families were less involved in cybervictimization. These findings highlight the importance of establishing positive and open communication between s and adolescents. The implications are discussed."
"Relationship between Parenting Style, Alexithymia and Aggression in Emerging Adults",2020,"Alexithymia has been linked to reduced emotional awareness and increased aggression. One line of evidence suggests that authoritarian  contributes to the development of alexithymia. To elucidate the relationship between experienced  , alexithymia and aggression the al Authority Questionnaire, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale and the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire were administered to a group of emerging adults. Current findings show a positive relationship between: (i) authoritarian   and alexithymia, (ii) alexithymia and aggression, iii) authoritarian   and aggression. This   found that paternal authoritarian  predicted alexithymia and aggression when controlling for maternal authoritarian , but not the other way round. In addition, alexithymia mediated the relationship between paternal authoritarian  and aggression when controlling for maternal authoritarian  suggesting that elevated alexithymia which is likely to be a consequence of authoritarian , especially when it is practiced by a father, contributes to increased aggression in adulthood."
Trajectories of delinquency and parenting styles,2008,"We investigated trajectories of adolescent delinquent development using data from the Pittsburgh Youth Study and examined the extent to which these different trajectories are differentially predicted by hood  . Based on self-reported and official delinquency seriousness, covering ages 10-19, we identified five distinct delinquency trajectories differing in both level and change in seriousness over time: a nondelinquent, minor persisting, moderate desisting, serious persisting, and serious desisting trajectory. More serious delinquents tended to more frequently engage in delinquency, and to report a higher proportion of theft. Proportionally, serious persistent delinquents were the most violent of all trajectory groups. Using cluster analysis we identified three  : authoritative, authoritarian (moderately supportive), and neglectful (punishing). Controlling for demographic characteristics and hood delinquency, neglectful  was more frequent in moderate desisters, serious persisters, and serious desisters, suggesting that   differentiate non- or minor delinquents from more serious delinquents."
THE INFLUENCES OF THE SIXTH GRADERS' PARENTS' INTERNET LITERACY AND PARENTING STYLE ON INTERNET PARENTING,2010,"This  aims to explore the sixth grade students' s' Internet literacy and   on Internet  in Kaohsiung County in Taiwan. Upon stratified cluster sampling, a total of 822 s from 34 classes in 28 schools participated in this . The descriptive statistics and chi-square test were used to analyze the responses of the Internet  questionnaire. The findings of this  include: (1) the current situations of the sixth grade students' s' behavior of Internet usage, Internet literacy,  , and Internet  are explored and analyzed, and (2) there are significant correlations among the students' s' behavior of Internet usage,  , Internet literacy, and Internet ."
Relationship Between Parenting Styles and Adolescents' Self-Esteem,2019,"Poor self-esteem among adolescents poses a great challenge, which   can influence. This  examined gender differences in perceived   and self-esteem of adolescents and examined the relationship between perceived   and adolescents' self-esteem among in-school adolescents in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. This  utilized a multistage sampling technique. Responses were elicited from 504 consenting pupils using the al authority questionnaire and a self-esteem questionnaire adjusted to the Rosenberg scale. Self-esteem was scored on a (12-30) scale; scores >= 26 indicate high self-esteem, and scores <= 25 indicate low self-esteem. The mean age and self-esteem score were 14.9 +/- 1.5 years and 24.0 +/- 3.3. About one third of respondents reported   as authoritative or flexible (fathers: 36.3%, mothers: 38.9%). Pearson correlation coefficient test showed a positive significant relationship between flexible   and adolescent self-esteem for fathers (r = 0.141, p = .001) and mothers (r = 0.137, p = .001). Research findings reveal significant association between perceived   and adolescents' self-esteem."
Parenting Styles in a Cultural Context: Observations of Protective Parenting in First-Generation Latinos,2009,"Current literature s four primary  : authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and neglectful. These  provide an important shortcut for a constellation of  behaviors that have been characterized as consisting of warmth, demandingness, and autonomy granting. Empirically, only warmth and demandingness are typically measured. Research reporting on   in Latino samples has been equivocal leading to questions about conceptualization and measurement of   in this ethnic/cultural group. This lack of consensus may  from the chasm between concepts (e.g., authoritarian ) and observable  behaviors (e.g., warmth) in this ethnic group. The   aimed to examine   and dimensions in a sample of Latino s using the two usual dimensions (warmth, demandingness) and adding autonomy granting. Traditional   categories were examined, as well as additional categorizations that ed from adding autonomy granting. Fifty first-generation Latino s and their  (aged 4-9) participated. - interactions were coded with the  Style Observation Rating Scale (P-SOS). In this sample, the four traditional  categories did not capture Latino families well. The combination of characteristics ed in eight possible  . Our data showed the majority (61%) of Latino s as protective s. Further, while mothers and fathers were similar in their  , expectations were different for male and female . The additional dimensions and implications are discussed. The importance of considering the cultural context in understanding  in Latino families is emphasized, along with directions for future ."
Self-Compassion and Dispositional Mindfulness Are Associated with Parenting Styles and Parenting Stress: the Mediating Role of Mindful Parenting,2016,"Mindful  is a recent concept in  studies and has been described as a set of al practices or skills that seek to enhance moment-to-moment awareness in the - relationship. Some studies suggest that mindful  is associated with 's dispositional mindfulness and self-compassion, while others suggest that mindful  can reduce  stress and promote a positive . However, there is no  describing an integrative model with these variables. The   explored whether s' dispositional mindfulness and self-compassion are associated with  stress and   through mindful . A sample of 333 s (87 fathers, 246 mothers) between the ages of 27 and 63 years participated in the . The  revealed that higher levels of dispositional mindfulness and self-compassion are associated with higher levels of mindful  that, in turn, is associated with lower levels of  stress, higher levels of authoritative  , and lower levels of authoritarian and permissive  . This  provides relevant and innovative data on mindful   by clarifying some of the modifiable variables that may facilitate the adoption of mindful  and of adaptive   and decrease  stress. These findings have important clinical implications for the identification of groups of more vulnerable s who would benefit most from mindful  interventions."
"Parenting Style, Child Emotion Regulation and Behavioral Problems: The Moderating Role of Cultural Values in Australia and Indonesia",2020,"Research has shown that the congruence of   with cultural values, rather than   alone, impacts  adjustment. This  examined if s' cultural values moderate the relationships between   and  outcomes across both an individualist culture (Australia) and a collectivist culture (Indonesia). Three hundred and eighty-seven s of 2-10-year-old  from both countries reported their  , the importance of the collectivistic values (security, conformity, and tradition), and their 's emotion regulation and behavioral problems. In both countries, authoritative  was associated with higher  emotion regulation and lower levels of behavioral problems, and authoritarian  was associated with lower  emotion regulation and higher levels of behavioral problems. Although cultural values did not moderate the relationship between authoritarian  and  adjustment, in both countries greater importance placed on tradition attenuated the positive effect of authoritative  on  outcomes."
Relationships between adolescent behavioral autonomy and parenting styles,2005,Main purpose of the   was to investigate the relationships between adolescent behavioral autonomy development and  . A total of 758 adolescents between ages 12 to 20 participated in this . The Adolescent Autonomy Scale and The  Style Scale were used for collecting v data. Results indicated that all of the male and female age groups except early adolescent females. responsiveness dimension of   significantly predicted adolescents' behavioral autonomy. Furthermore. autonomy dimension of   significantly predicted early and middle adolescent females behavioral autonomy. Furthermore. adolescents who described their s as authoritative showed more behavioral autonomy than adolescents who described their s as autoritarian and permissive-indulgent: adolescents who described their s as permissive-indulgent showed more behavioral autonomy that adolescents who described their s as permissive-neglectful and autoritarian.
Personality and parenting style in parents of adolescents,2010,"Since al personality traits are assumed to play a role in  behaviors, the current  examined the relation between al personality and   among 688 Dutch s of adolescents in the SMILE . The  assessed Big Five personality traits and derived   (authoritative, authoritarian, indulgent, and uninvolved) from scores on the underlying dimensions of support and strict control. Regression analyses were used to determine which personality traits were associated with  dimensions and .

Parenting Stress and Quality of Life in Pediatric Obesity: The Mediating Role of Parenting Styles,2016,"Pediatric obesity is a serious health condition associated with lower psychosocial adjustment in /adolescents and their families. Mothers of /adolescents with obesity usually  higher levels of  stress, and investigation shows that the authoritarian and permissive   are more used by those mothers. However, little is known about the influence of al variables on /adolescent outcomes. This  intended to: (1) investigate differences in the quality of life (QoL) between /adolescents with obesity and healthy weight, (2) investigate differences between mothers regarding  stress and  , and (3) assess the mediating role of   in the relationship between  stress and the QoL of /adolescents with obesity. The sample comprised 223 /adolescents and their mothers (125 /adolescents with a healthy weight and 98 with obesity). Children/adolescents completed measures of QoL (KIDSCREEN-10) and mothers completed measures of  stress ( Stress Index) and   ( Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire). Mothers of /adolescents with obesity ed higher levels of  stress than mothers of /adolescents with healthy weight. Mothers of adolescents with obesity used more a permissive   than mothers of adolescents with healthy weight. Higher levels of  stress were associated with poorer QoL in /adolescents through the use of permissive  . This  emphasizes the connection between  stress,   and 's/adolescent's QoL, providing innovative input to the field by identifying mechanisms that might account for the link between family and  variables."
"Effectiveness of Positive Discipline Parenting Program on Parenting Style, and Child Adaptive Behavior",,"In this , a community sample of s attending free 7-week Positive Discipline  workshops were recruited, as well as a non-randomized community control. Both samples consisted of primarily Hispanic s with similar demographic information and attrition rates (initial N = 91), as well as  of similar age (mean age 6.89 and 6.95 years) and gender.  stress,  , and -reported  adaptive behavior were assessed at baseline and after three months. Longitudinal analysis was performed using mixed-effects regression modeling. Results indicate that attendance in Positive Discipline  workshops was related to a decrease in authoritarian  , a decrease in permissive  , and a decrease in al stress. It was  related to an increase in  academic competence, and a decrease in externalizing-hyperactive behavior (both -report). These  suggest that positive discipline  workshops may alter   and may positively impact  of s who attend."

Parenting Warmth and Strictness across Three Generations: Parenting Styles and Psychosocial Adjustment,2020,"Recent emergent  is seriously questioning whether al strictness contributes to 's psychosocial adjustment in all cultural contexts. We examined cross-generational differences in al practices characterized by warmth and practices characterized by strictness, as well as the relationship between   (authoritative, indulgent, authoritarian, and neglectful) and psychosocial adjustment in adulthood.  practices characterized by warmth (affection, reasoning, indifference, and detachment) and strictness (revoking privileges, verbal scolding, and physical punishment) were examined. Psychosocial adjustment was captured with multidimensional self-concept and well-being (life satisfaction and happiness). Participants were 871 individuals who were members of three generations of Spanish families: College students (G3), their s (G2), and their grands (G1). Results showed two different cross-generational patterns in  practices, with an increased tendency toward al warmth (s use more affection and reasoning but less indifference across generations) and a decreased tendency toward al strictness (s use revoking privileges, verbal scolding, and physical punishment less across generations). Interestingly, despite cross-generational differences in  practices, a common pattern between   and psychosocial adjustment was found: indulgent  was related to equal or even better self-concept and well-being than authoritative , whereas  characterized by non-warmth (authoritarian and neglectful) was related to poor scores."
Parenting Style as a Moderator for Students' Academic Achievement,2012,"  have always been a crucial factor in influencing all aspects of a person's development.

Results: In the  , the sex of s, the gender of , number and age of , income level and s' education did not show any significant difference between the two groups. The   did not differ significantly between the two groups and this can be due to the sampling of health centers because people who come to health centers are careful about their own health and their  and those addicts who have a wrong life and consequently a wrong   may refer to centers less. Discussion: In the   there was no significant difference between the gender of s and , number and age of , level of income and  the level of s' education for both groups. Also, there was no significant difference in   between both groups and it can be for the reason of health centers sampling because people who refer to health centers are certainty careful about the health of themselves and their  but some addicted people with incorrect life and   may less refer to health centers. We reviewed various studies in this regard. According to the importance of this issue and its important effects on different studies, carrying out exclusive es is necessary in this context.

The mediating model ed a very good fit for the data (CFI = 0.95, RMSEA = 0.07, 90% CI = 0.046/0.094) and has shown to be invariant across mothers of different age groups. Direct and indirect effects were found, with  stress affecting   directly, and indirectly, through psychological flexibility within . The lower levels of psychological flexibility within  were translated into lower use of authoritative   and into a higher use of authoritarian or permissive  of . Also, multigroup analyses showed that the model was variant as a function of global psychological flexibility (Delta chi(2)((10)) = 138.09, p < .001) supporting the buffer effect of global psychological flexibility in these relationships. Our  are innovative by highlighting the important role of psychological flexibility within  as a self-regulatory skill in the mother- relationship, as it influences the mothers' ability to regulate their emotions and behavior in a way that promotes a sensitive response to the 's needs and good  practices, even in the presence of stressful demands ( stress)."
Parenting style in family and the risk of psychopathology,2018,"  is one of the exogenous factors, participating both in the etiology of psychopathology and in the healthy development of a . Four main  , investigated so far, which evoke ers interest most frequently, are: authoritative, authoritarian, permissive (liberal) loving and permissive uninvolved . Research conducted in different countries has allowed us to describe connections between applying particular upbringing models and the occurrence of depression, eating disorders, addictions or violence. It has been evidenced that liberal- unloving  , based on little control, and lack of emotional support, is positively associated with aggressive behavior.  models based on excessive control and emotional coldness increase the risk of depression and substance abuse in  and adolescent, whereas authoritative   applied by both s minimalizes the risk of depression, suicidal tendencies and is  negatively correlated with substance abuse, bulimia and anorexia nervosa. Scientific reports indicate cross-cultural differences in young people's perception of their 's . For example, uninvolved   was associated with higher depressiveness in Asian females than in African-American. Our paper s a review of investigations on   and their , conducted in different times and often in different cultures. The ed data allows us to formulate general conclusions and recommendations concerning  methods which may minimize the risk of psychopathology in youth. Authoritative , consisting in high control combined with expression of emotional warmth, seems to be the most advantageous for the 's development."

Bidirectional relations between temperament and parenting styles in Chinese ,2013,"The   examined bidirectional relations between  temperament and   in a sample (n = 425) of Chinese  during the elementary school period (age range = 6 to 9 years at Wave 1). Using two waves (3.8 years apart) of longitudinal data, we tested two hypotheses: (1) whether  temperament (effortful control and anger/frustration) at Wave 1 predicts   (authoritative and authoritarian ) at Wave 2, controlling for Wave 1 ; and (2) whether   at Wave 1 predict Wave 2 temperament, controlling for Wave 1 temperament. We found support for bidirectional relations between temperament and authoritarian , such that higher effortful control and lower anger/frustration were associated with higher authoritarian  across time and in both directions. There were no significant cross-time associations between 's temperament and authoritative . These findings extend previous tests of transactional relations between  temperament and  in Chinese  and are consistent with cultural values toward effortful control and control of anger/frustration in Chinese society."

This descriptive  examined the individual   of a sample of 82 Irish immigrant mothers and investigated the factors that influenced their individual  . The findings suggest that the permissive and authoritative   scores of this sample of Irish immigrant mothers are related to their perception of their mothers'   scores. The relationship between the Irish immigrants mothers' authoritarian   scores and their mothers' authoritarian   scores approached significance at .063. These findings suggest that, when asked to compare their   to their mothers, the Irish immigrant participants reported a stronger authoritative  , a stronger permissive  , and a weaker authoritarian  . In a standard multiple regression the most significant variables that emerged as influential on current   were the grandmothers'   score, perception of social support, and working outside of the home."
Parenting style and obesity risk in ,2015,"Background. s play a critical role in their 's life habits. The objective was to assess the effect of   on the risk of hood obesity, and to determine whether poverty was a moderator of the association. Methods. Participants were from the 1994-2008 cross-sectional samples of the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY), a nationally reative survey of Canadian youth. Factor and cluster analyses identified four   consistent with Baumrind's   prototypes. Multivariable logistic regression assessed the risk of obesity based on   after adjusting for covariates. Analyses were stratified by age (preschool: 2-5 years of age, n = 19,026; school-age: 6-11 years of age, n = 18,551) and the moderating effect of poverty (household income < low income cut-offs adjusted for household size and geographic region) was assessed. Analyses used sampling and bootstrap weights. Results. In multivariable analyses, compared to authoritative , preschool- and school-age  with authoritarian s were 35% (95% CI: 1.2-1.5) and 41% (CI: 1.1-1.8) more likely to be obese, respectively. In preschool , poverty moderated this association: authoritarian and negligent  was associated with 44% (CI: 1.3-1.7) and 26% (Cl: 1.1-1.4) increased likelihood of obesity, respectively, but only among the  not living in poverty. In school-age , poverty was not a moderator. Conclusions.   is associated with hood obesity, but may be moderated by poverty. Successful strategies to combat hood obesity should reflect the independent and interactive associations of sociodemographic and social-familial influences on health especially in early hood.

However, the association between   and  agricultural injury has not been explored. This  was conducted among farm s in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania using a self-administered paper questionnaire. s responded to items inquiring about  , previous  agricultural injuries, personal demographics, and farm characteristics. A total of 238 farm s responded to the survey. Over a third of respondents (34.3%) reported a  agricultural injury. About 41% of s were classified as authoritative (demonstrating a high level of involvement and control), 35.7% as uninvolved, 13.3% as permissive, and 10% as authoritarian. In the univariable analyses of  , notable elevations in  injury rates occurred for the authoritarian (RR = 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 3.58, p = 0.0274) and uninvolved (RR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.50, p = 0.0506) categories as compared to the referent category of authoritative. In the multivariable analyses that were adjusted for confounding variables, the magnitude of the corresponding RR estimates were less dramatic, although a 69% elevation was still  for the authoritarian   (RR = 1.69, 95% CI 0.91 to 3.15, p = 0.0975). The  of this  contribute to the growing body of literature suggesting that authoritative  is protective against risk-taking behaviors in hood as well as reducing potential injury among .

Significant positive association was found between authoritarian   and aggression (P<0.01) and significant inverse relationship between authoritative  of  and aggression (P<0.05) in adolescents. So, s with authoritarian   had higher level of aggression. Authoritarian  significantly predicted (19%) aggression in adolescents, while authoritative   was not a significant predictor of aggression in adolescents. CONCLUSION: In our , there is significant effect of authoritative and authoritarian   on aggression and most of the  from authoritarian s have high level of aggression as compared to authoritative s."
"Reconsidering Parenting in Chinese Culture: Subtypes, Stability, and Change of Maternal Parenting Style During Early Adolescence",2017," in Chinese culture has been a central topic and there have been debate on whether western-derived   is applicable to Chinese cultures in terms of both behavioral profiles and their relationships with  and adolescent adjustment. This  identified the subtypes of Chinese maternal   and examined their stability and changes over the transition to early adolescence. In an urban Chinese sample (N = 2173, 48% girls), four waves of longitudinal data were collected when the adolescents were in the fifth (M = 11.27 years), sixth, seventh, and eighth grades. Latent profile analysis identified four subtypes of  : authoritative, authoritarian, average-level undifferentiated, and strict-affectionate. Adolescents of authoritative mothers exhibited the best overall adjustment, while adolescents of authoritarian mothers showed the worst adjustment. Adolescents of strict-affectionate mothers generally adjusted as well as those of authoritative mothers, except they showed lower academic achievement. The strict-affectionate  reed a culture-specific subtype of   in Chinese culture. Latent transition analysis revealed high stability of   during early adolescence, but transitions between subtypes were  evident.

While authoritative   is linked to healthier weight and dietary outcomes in , and authoritarian and permissive   with unhealthy eating, little is known about the mechanisms that mediate these relationships. Feeding  are often examined in relation to  diet, but they do not consider the social and physical environmental contexts in which dietary behaviors occur. Therefore, this  examined whether   (authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive) were associated with three specific food-related  practices - mealtime structural practices (e.g., eating meals as a family),  modeling of healthy food, and household food rules and whether these  practices mediated the association between   and 's diet. Participants were 174 mother- dyads. Mothers (68% married, 58% college graduates, M-age = 41 years [SD = 6.2]) reported on their  practices using validated scales and   using the  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire. Children (52% female, M-age = 10 years [SD = 0.9]) completed two telephone-based 24-hour dietary recalls. Dietary outcomes included the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010 score, and fruit and vegetables and added sugar intake. Using PROCESS, multiple mediation cross-sectional analyses with parallel mediators using 10,000 bootstraps were performed. Significant indirect effects were observed with mealtime structure and the relationships between authoritative  and HEI-2010 score (b = 0.045, p < .05, CI = [0.006, 0.126]), authoritarian  and HEI-2010 score (b = 0.055, p < .05, CI = [-0.167, -0.001]), and permissive  and HEI-2010 score (b = 0.093, p < .05, CI = [-0.265, -0.008]). Child diet quality is affected by mealtime structural practices.

Parenting in the digital era: Protective and risk parenting styles for traditional bullying and cyberbullying victimization,2019,"This  analyzes the   that could act as risk or protective factors for bullying and cyberbullying victimization in Spain, considering the predisposition to aggression of the adolescents. The protective or risk effect of   for adolescents related behavior such as antisocial behavior, school adjustment, and self-esteem was  analyzed. Study sample was 1109 adolescents aged between 12 and 17 years (49.96%, females, M = 13.88, SD = 1.38). A 4 x 2 x 2 x 2 MANOVA was applied for the outcome variables of bullying victimization (traditional bullying and cyberbullying), antisocial behavior, school adjustment, and self-esteem; with  , predisposition to aggression, sex and age as independent variables. The  confirm and extend emergent  in  , carried out in Spain and other European and Latin-American countries, showing that indulgent , characterized by the use of reasoning and warmth practices, can act as a protective factor for both traditional bullying and cyberbullying victimization. On the contrary, authoritarian , characterized by the use of physical and verbal coercion and privation practices, would act as a risk factor for cyberbullying and traditional bullying victimization. The protective and risk effects of   over adolescents' adjustment take place irrespective of the adolescents' predisposition to aggression."
AUTHORITARIAN PARENTING STYLE IN ASIAN SOCIETIES: A CLUSTER-ANALYTIC INVESTIGATION,2006,"While the beneficial effects of authoritative   have consistently been demonstrated for Caucasian samples, these effects have not always been found for Asians. It appears that adolescents who perceived their s'  of  as authoritarian are not one homogeneous group. Cluster analyses performed for adolescents' perceived mothers' and fathers' authoritarian   using adolescents' self-report scores on personal adjustment and social variables as the clustering variables found similar two-cluster solutions (maladjusted and well-adjusted). External validation evidence revealed that adolescents in the maladjusted cluster had poorer attitudes towards school and teachers compared to adolescents in the well-adjusted cluster for both samples. These findings suggest that authoritarian   could possibly have a different cultural meaning for Asians."
The Relation between Parenting Stress and Child Behavior Problems: Negative Parenting Styles as Mediator,2020," young  could be stressful at times and  stress could have an impact on   and  behavior problems which could lead to difficulties in later life. Therefore, the relationship among these three factors is worthy of examination. In this  we aim to examine the direct relationship between  stress,  , and perceived  behavior problems; and to investigate a model that illustrates the mediating role of negative (authoritarian and permissive)   on the relationship between  stress and perceived  behavior problems in China. A total of 371 s with preschool age  (3 to 7 years old) were recruited. The  showed higher level of  stress was associated with higher level of reported  behavior problems.  stress was positively related to negative  , and negative   partially mediated the relationship between  stress and  behavior problems. Findings from this  suggested that reducing  stress, improving  behaviors such as  , and enhancing - relationship through early support (e.g.,  skills training) are of vital importance and mutual benefits to the s, , and family relationships at large."
Parenting style as a predictor of music preference,2020,"Although previous  has established relationships between perceived   and 's deviant behaviours and links between these behaviours and a liking for intense and rebellious music, no  has explored the associations between perceived   and 's liking for different music . Whereas previous  has considered musical taste by looking at a small number of individual difference variables in isolation from one another, the   used a cross-sectional correlational design to investigate whether  , the Big Five personality traits, sensation seeking, age, and gender were associated with a liking for different music . In total, 336 Australians completed an online, self-report questionnaire. Analyses demonstrated there were relationships between five of the six   variables and five of the music  considered. This indicates that various   were associated with musical taste, and the nature of these associations extends well beyond those concerning rebellious music and neglectful  that have been identified by previous ."
Interaction of parenting styles and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in Iranian parents,2002,"This  examines the mutual relationships between   and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), utilizing a sample of 130 Iranian s of  with ADHD and 120 s of  without ADHD. The  indicate that there are significant relationships between ADHD and  . That is, there is a negative relationship between having an ADHD  and applying authoritative  , whereas the relationship is positive for the authoritarian . We do not find any significant relationship between having an ADHD  and applying a permissive  . Gender comparisons indicate that fathers and mothers of non-ADHD  show no difference in using  , but s of ADHD  show some differences in authoritative and authoritarian . The findings are in agreement with the interactive views on ADHD etiology (Hinshaw, 1994) and  with findings showing that the continuation of ADHD through development is partly related to   (Campbell & Ewing, 1990). Implications for assessing both   and al training are discussed."
Math Anxiety: The Relationship Between Parenting Style and Math Self-Efficacy,2019,"The goal of the current  is to examine the direct and indirect influences of  , math self-efficacy, and the participants' sex on math anxiety. The  population (N = 204) included randomly selected participants, whose native language is Hebrew and were born in Israel. The participants were surveyed about four measures that served as the  tools. They answered questions about demographics, math anxiety, and the   of the 's mother and about math self-efficacy. The  data concluded that there were strong correlations between the authoritarian   and math anxiety. The authoritative   had both a direct positive correlation and an indirect negative correlation on math anxiety. This is in contrast to the permissive   which was exclusively found to have a small positive correlation on math anxiety. The participant's sex had both direct and indirect influences on math anxiety. Math anxiety levels, as well as the negative effects of self-efficacy on the level of math anxiety, were higher in females compared to males. These findings are relevant when considering methods of diagnosis and intervention surrounding math anxiety."
Application of latent profile analysis to define subgroups of parenting styles and food parenting practices,2019,"Food  practices and   are associated with  weight status, dietary intake, and eating behaviors. Although s maintain a   while  engaging in food  practices day-today, most studies have examined the separate impact of these two constructs on  outcomes. An examination of both practices and  will facilitate the identification of how they mutually co-exist and influence  weight and weight-related outcomes. The current  examined the clustering of food  practices and   and evaluated the relationship between these  characteristics and  weight status, diet quality and eating behaviors. Children aged 5-7 and their s (N = 150) from six racial/ethnic groups were recruited through primary care clinics. Latent class analysis classified subgroups based on  practices and . Regression analyses examined relationships between subgroups and  outcomes. The best-fitting model was two subgroups. s in subgroup 1 (n = 37) were more likely to restrict foods, pressure  to eat and less likely to engage in food modeling compared to subgroup 2 (n = 112). s in subgroup 1 were more likely to report authoritarian and permissive   and less likely to report an authoritative  , compared to subgroup 2. s in subgroup 1 were more likely to report  who ate to obtain pleasure and who lacked internal cues for hunger than those in subgroup 2. There were no association between subgroups and  weight status, diet quality and other eating behaviors. Future  and interventions should take into consideration how   and practices mutually influence  weight and weight-related outcomes."

"Parenting styles, moral identity and prosocial behaviors in adolescents",,"The   explores perceived  , moral identity and prosocial behaviors in adolescents. It was hypothesized that perceived   are likely to predict moral identity and prosocial behaviors in adolescents. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that moral identity is likely to mediate the relationship between perceived   and prosocial behaviors. Through purposive sampling, a sample of 236 (boys = 128; girls = 108) adolescents was selected from different schools of Lahore, Pakistan. al Authority Questionnaire-Revised (PAQ-R), Self-Importance of Moral Identity Scale and Prosocial Tendencies Measure-Revised (PTM-R) were administered to collect data. SPSS and AMOS were used to analyze the collected data. Results showed that perceived permissive   was negatively related to moral identity and prosocial behaviors in adolescents. Furthermore, perceived authoritative  was positively related to moral identity and prosocial behaviors. However, in the case of authoritarian , only perceived mother's authoritarian  showed negative relationship with prosocial behaviors and only perceived father's authoritarian  showed positive relationship with moral identity. Moral identity (internalization) was positively related to compliant, altruistic, anonymous, dire, emotional prosocial behaviors while moral identity (symbolization) was positively related to compliant, anonymous, dire, emotional and public prosocial behaviors. Mediation analyses showed that moral identity was a significant mediator between perceived   and prosocial behaviors. The findings showed that  plays an essential role in the internalization of moral values in adolescents."

As part of a larger , mothers of preschool  were recruited through Head Start programs and completed validated questionnaires assessing their general , feeding , and feeding practices. Results identified numerous associations between general  dimensions and specific feeding practices: i.e., maternal nurturance was positively associated with healthy eating guidance and feeding responsiveness; inconsistency was positively associated with restriction for weight and promotion of overconsumption; follow through on discipline was positively associated with monitoring, healthy eating guidance, and feeding responsiveness; and family organization was positively associated with monitoring and healthy eating guidance. General   were associated with feeding practices as well, with authoritative mothers showing the highest levels of healthy eating guidance and authoritarian mothers showing the lowest levels of monitoring. There were no significant associations between mothers' general   and mothers' feeding . Implications of these findings for the prevention of hood obesity are considered."
Assessment of global parenting style and specific parenting behavior in a Chinese context,1999,"On two occasions separated by one year, 378 Chinese secondary school students responded to the Paternal Treatment Scale (PTS), Maternal Treatment Scale (MTS), Paternal  Scale (PPS), and Maternal  Scale (MPS), with the first two scales measuring global   and the latter two scales assessing specific  behavior. Factor analyses showed that two dimensions (concern and harshness) were intrinsic to the PTS and MTS and two factors (responsiveness and demandingness) were abstracted from the PPS and MPS. Further analyses showed that the factors derived from the scales were highly stable across time and sample. Reliability analyses showed that the related scales and subscales at different time were internally consistent. There is  some support for the validity of the related measures."

In addition,  and adolescent reports of two   (i.e., need support and regulation) and al goal promotion dimensions (i.e., intrinsic vs. extrinsic and conservation vs. openness to change goal promotion) are gathered. Whereas al religiosity is positively related to a tendency to promote conservation rather than openness to change goals, a symbolic religious cognitive  relates positively to need support and the promotion of intrinsic rather than extrinsic goals. Hence, whereas relations between al religiosity as such and  are limited and not unequivocally positive, a symbolic religious cognitive  systematically relates to adaptive   and goals. Implications are discussed."

Parenting style and adolescent smoking cognitions and behaviour,2007,"  and smoking-related cognitions have both successfully predicted adolescent smoking behaviour. Data were collected among 482 Dutch adolescents to examine whether effects of   (authoritative, permissive, authoritarian, rejecting, neglecting, measured by underlying dimensions support, strict control, and psychological control) on adolescent lifetime smoking were mediated by cognitions (pro-smoking attitude, social norm, self-efficacy, intention) and to  the role of gender in this process. Support was not significantly associated with smoking behaviour. The inverse relation between strict control and smoking was partly mediated by attitude and intention, both associated with increased smoking. Psychological control related directly to increased lifetime smoking. Combinations of dimensions creating the specific  were not associated with cognitions or behaviour. Maternal and paternal  were equally associated with smoking cognitions and behaviour; nor were effects moderated by adolescent gender. Interventions to prevent adolescent smoking initiation should aim at increasing strict control and reducing psychological control."

The  of the analysis showed that the articles related to   have remained considerably high over the years because of the importance and seriousness of its role in an adolescent's character and personality building. Considering the low number of qualitative studies, it is recommended that further studies should employ this approach to investigate various aspects of   in depth. Moreover, interventions should be carried out to improve and enhance the effectiveness of  and consequently the psychosocial success of adolescents"
Maternal and Paternal Parenting Style Patterns and Adolescent Emotional and Behavioral Outcomes,2014,"The purpose of this  was to extend current  to examine the relationship between   combinations and adolescent emotional/behavioral outcomes to further understand affective functioning in adolescents. Previous  solely analyzed mothers, without including fathers and/or both s. The roles of temperament and adolescent and  gender were  examined. Participants were 12- to 18-year-old students (n = 195) in 7th to 11th grade in a rural school district in southeast Michigan. Temperament characteristics (i.e., mood, flexibility-rigidity, and eating rhythmicity) explained nearly half of the variance in adolescent outcomes.   contributed a smaller but significant role. When both s were authoritative, it was associated with more optimal outcomes in adolescents' personal adjustment than any other   combination. Having one authoritative , which was expected to be a protective factor, was related to high personal adjustment for girls but higher levels of school maladjustment for boys. Mixed associations were found for   combinations and adolescent outcomes. Overall, when both s were permissive and neglectful, these   were associated with poorer adolescent outcomes. Study findings confirm that   patterns are important; however, adolescent temperament plays a much larger role, overall, in adolescent affective functioning."
Parenting style and the development of noncognitive ability in ,2020,"We investigate the impact of   on 's noncognitive ability development using data from China. Based on an extensive set of questions of caregiver- interaction, we distinguish   (i.e., respectful and disciplinary) from traditional material and time al investment. We find that respectful   significantly influences the formation of 's noncognitive ability. Our  suggest that with detailed measures of   and al investment,  taken care by s and grands do not exhibit significant differences in noncognitive ability. A further investigation of unobserved heterogeneity based on different techniques reveals a causal and long-lasting relationship from   to noncognitive ability."
"Parenting styles, parenting practices, and physical activity in 10- to 11-year olds",2011,"Objective. The objective of this  was to determine whether   and practices are associated with 's physical activity. Methods. Cross-sectional survey of seven hundred ninety-two 10- to 11-year-old UK  in Bristol (UK) in 2008-2009 was conducted. Accelerometer-assessed physical activity and mean minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (mean MVPA) and mean counts per minute (mean CPM) were obtained. Matemal   and physical activity  practices were self-reported. Results. In regression analyses, permissive  was associated with higher mean MVPA among girls (+ 6.0 min/day, p < 0.001) and greater mean CPM (+ 98.9 accelerometer counts/min, p = 0.014) among boys when compared to  with authoritative s. Maternal logistic support was associated with mean CPM for girls (+ 362 counts/min, p = 0.001), while paternal logistic support was associated with boys' mean MVPA (+ 4.0 min/day, p = 0.049) and mean CPM (+ 55.7 counts/min, p = 0.014). Conclusions. Maternal permissive  was associated with higher levels of physical activity than authoritative , but associations differed by  gender and type of physical activity. Maternal logistic support was associated with girls' physical activity, while paternal logistic support was associated with boys' physical activity. Health professionals could encourage s to increase logistic support for their 's physical activity. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Perceived Parenting Style and Adolescents' Social Anxiety in Selangor, Malaysia",2020,"Anxiety, especially social anxiety, is the most common mental health issue among Malaysian adolescents, and   have been suggested to play a crucial role in the development of adolescents' anxiety symptoms. Therefore, this paper investigates the relationship between Malaysian adolescents' perceptions of their s'   and their measured level of social anxiety, including differences by age and race. A total of 327 adolescents from international and national secondary schools in Selangor participated in this . The al Perception Questionnaire and Kutcher Generalized Social Anxiety Disorder Scale for Adolescents were used to measure the adolescents' perceptions of   and social anxiety, respectively. The  showed no significant correlations between   and social anxiety. In addition,   did not significantly predict the adolescents' social anxiety. However, there were significant racial and age group differences in the categories of   and levels of social anxiety. In conclusion, the   received by Malaysian adolescents was not significantly related to their social anxiety. Interventions should focus on high-risk groups of adolescents (i.e., Malay adolescents and those aged 15-16 years old) to reduce their social anxiety."
Parenting Styles and Juvenile Delinquency: Exploring Gendered Relationships,2018,"We use the NLSY97 dataset to examine the -delinquency relationship and how it is conditioned by s' gender, controlling for youths' gender. Generally, neglectful and authoritarian   were associated with the highest levels of delinquency in youths. When the sample was split by  gender, authoritarianism held up across both groups, but permissive and neglectful  was only significant for fathers. Independent of  , boys have higher delinquency levels than girls. The strength and magnitude of this relationship is nearly identical in separate equations for mothers and fathers. al attachment was not a significant protective factor against delinquency for either mothers or fathers."
The Effect Of Parenting Style On Adolescent's Perception Towards Road Safety,2020,"The purview of this paper is to analyze the relationships between   and adolescent risk behaviors on the road due to the critical al role in preventing crashes among teens. The objectives of this  are to list different   that may influence adolescent behavior, to assess the relationship between   and adolescent's perception towards road safety, to determine which   that promotes a desirable street protection habits among adolescent, and to propose a framework that integrated   to road safety program. Descriptive and statistical analyses are used in this paper to interpret the data taken from 298 questionnaire- respondents which the parallel between the desired   and the adolescent's good perception of road safety is cast using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. A quantitative approach is employed in processing the data taken from those selected respondents then the qualitative data is composed and operated to complete the quantitative data by giving more comprehensive knowledge over the argumentation and more description of the quantitative . More so, the  supports the substantial influence of   on adolescent development such as the adolescents who are raised in authoritative households consistently demonstrate higher protective and fewer risk behaviors than adolescents from non-authoritative families."
Gaming Disorder and Parenting Style: A Case Series,2020,"Objectives: The increasing prevalence of gaming disorder poses new challenges in terms of detection and prevention. Identification of risk factors is necessary to predict, diagnose, treat, and form health policies as regards to gaming disorders. The objective of this  was to report cases in regard to the identification of   as a risk factor for gaming disorder and its role in the management of the condition. Methods: Through clinical case descriptions, we  2 cases where patients were brought to our addiction clinic due to excessive gaming causing social and academic dysfunction. Results: These cases portray 2 different  , authoritarian and permissive, both contributing heavily to the gaming disorder they endured. The patients were provided with family therapy along with motivational enhancement and pharmacotherapy which ed in improvement in their Internet Addiction Test scores. Conclusions: This case series s 2 cases of gaming disorder in Indonesia wherein   plays an important role in predisposing individuals to gaming disorder. To our knowledge, this report is the first to explore cases of gaming disorder in Indonesia and the treatment plans implemented in these cases can be used as a clinical recommendation for the management of gaming disorders in Indonesia. Expectantly, information regarding the association of   and gaming can aid in screening and treatment of gaming disorders."
PERCEIVED PARENTING STYLE AND SELF CONCEPT OF INDIAN ADOLESCENTS- MODERATING ROLE OF GENDER,2018,"The   focused on   and its impact on the self-concept of secondary school students. The sample consisted of 200 adolescent students of class 9th and 10th of schools of Pathankot city. Data was analysed by using correlation and hierarchical multiple regression. Moderate and significant correlations were observed between   (democratic, autocratic and accepting) and self-concept of the adolescents. To detect the overall effect of gender as moderator in the relationship between   and self-concept of adolescents, the R2 values of the regression model that included  , i.e. democratic, autocratic and accepting and their interactions with gender was compared with the regression model having   without interaction terms. No significant interaction effect of gender of adolescent and   (democratic, autocratic and accepting) was observed in the analysis. Democratic   was the strongest predictor of self-concept among adolescents. s must be taught that  should involve an appropriate balance of warmth and restrictiveness."
Parenting Style as a Predictor of Adolescent Weight and Weight-Related Behaviors,2010,"Purpose: Current  indicates that specific   are associated with adolescent overweight, dietary intake, and physical activity; but most of the  has been cross-sectional, making it difficult to determine the temporal order of these associations. The current  adds to the previous  by examining 5-year longitudinal associations between   and adolescent weight and weight-related behaviors. Methods: Data from Project EAT, a population-based  with adolescents from diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds, were used. Adolescents (N = 2,516) from 31 Minnesota schools completed in-class assessments in 1999 (Time 1) and mailed surveys in 2004 (Time 2). Multiple linear regression models were used to predict mean levels of adolescent outcomes at Time 2 from   at Time 1. Results: Time 1 maternal authoritative   predicted lower body mass index in adolescent sons and daughters at Time 2. Time 1 paternal permissive   predicted more fruits and vegetables intake in daughters at Time 2. Significant associations were not found between   and adolescent physical activity. Conclusions: Findings suggest that authoritative   may play a protective role related to adolescent overweight and that the dimension of warmth and/or caring in the -adolescent relationship may be important in relation to female adolescent healthy dietary intake. Further exploration of opposite sex -adolescent dyad patterns related to   and adolescent weight and weight-related behaviors is warranted. (C) 2010 Society for Adolescent Medicine.

Intergenerational Transmission of Parenting Style and Personality: Direct Influence or Mediation?,2009,"In order to examine the relationships between   and personality traits over generations, a cross-sectional questionnaire  was conducted for fathers and mothers of school-age  of grades 5-9. The   measured by the al Bonding Instrument (PBI) and the personality traits measured by the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) were correlated within and between the consecutive generations (the grands and the s for the PBI and the s and the  for the TCI). A series of structural equation modeling showed that (1) while the   were transmitted directly from the grands to the s, it was partly mediated by the fathers' Co-operativeness (C) but not so for the mothers, (2) while the personality traits were transmitted directly from the s to the , it was only the fathers'   that mediated C, and (3) the s'   had independent effects upon the 's personality traits."
The relationship between parenting styles and emotional intelligence of kindergarten ,2020,"This  aimed at investigating the relationship between the   and emotional intelligence of a sample of kindergarten  in Zarqa II Governorate, Jordan. To achieve this objective, two measures were utilized, namely, the emotional intelligence scale of the kindergarten  and the   scale on a sample of 100 kindergarten , 47 of whom were male and 53 were female. The  revealed that the prevalent   were the democratic, authoritative, and permissive  respectively. Further, the  showed a statistically significant positive relation between the democratic   and emotional intelligence in all its domains, and showed a statistically significant negative relationship between the authoritative and permissive  and emotional intelligence. Furthermore, the  revealed a lack of statistical differences in all areas due to the impact of gender in emotional intelligence. The  recommended that s should pay more attention to the most appropriate   with their ."
The Relationship between Students' Creativity and Parenting Styles with High School Students' Procrastination,2017,"The   investigates the relationship between students' creativity and   with students' procrastination. The  sample consists of 120 subjects including 60 boys and 60 girls. In this , the academic procrastination questionnaire of Solomon and Rothblum (1984), the   questionnaire of Baumrind (1972) along with the creativity questionnaire of Torrance (Visual Form B) were distributed among sample members. In order for  data to be analyzed and, , achieve the aim of the , statistical methods such as Stepwise Regression Method along with Pearson's Correlation were used. The obtained  reveal that there is a significant inverse correlation between free   and creativity. Also, there is a considerable direct relation between authoritarian   and creativity; however, there is not any meaningful association between autocratic   and creativity."
Parenting Style Dimensions As Predictors of Adolescent Antisocial Behavior,2016,"Antisocial behavior is strongly associated with academic failure in adolescence. There is a solid body of evidence that points to   as one of its main predictors. The objective of this work is to elaborate a reduced, valid, and reliable version of the questionnaire by Oliva et al. (2007) to evaluate the dimensions of   and to analyze its psychometric properties in a sample of Spanish adolescents. To that end, the designed questionnaire was applied to 1974 adolescents 1218 years of age from Asturias (Spain). Regarding construct validity, the  show that the model that best res the data is composed of six dimensions of  , just as in the original scale, namely affection and communication; promotion of autonomy; behavioral control; psychological control; self-disclosure; and humor. The psychological control factor negatively correlates with the other factors, with the exception of behavioral control, with which it positively correlates. The remaining correlations among the factors in the   questionnaire are positive. Regarding internal consistency, the reliability analysis for each factor supports the suitability of this six-factor model. With regard to criterion validity, as expected based on the evidence available, the six dimensions of   correlate in a statistically significant manner with the three antisocial behavior measures used as criteria (off-line school aggression, antisocial behavior, and antisocial friendships). Specifically, all dimensions negatively correlate with the three variables, except for psychological control. In the latter case, the correlation is positive. The theoretical and practical implications of these  are discussed."
Dysfunctional Parenting Styles Increase Interpersonal Sensitivity in Healthy Subjects,2009,"The effects of dysfunctional   on interpersonal sensitivity were studied in 640 Japanese volunteers. Interpersonal sensitivity was assessed by the Interpersonal Sensitivity Measure (IPSM), and perceived al rearing was evaluated by the al Bonding Instrument (PBI), which is consisted of care and protection factors. al rearing was classified into 4 types, i.e., optimal  (high care/low protection), affectionate constraint (high care/high protection), neglectful  (low care/low protection), and affectionless control (low care/high protection). Males with paternal affectionless control showed higher total IPSM scores than those with paternal optimal  (p = 0.022). Females with maternal affectionate constraint (p = 0.001), neglectful  (p = 0.022), and affectionless control (p = 0.003) showed higher total IPSM scores than those with maternal optimal . In males and females, dysfunctional   by the opposite-sex s did not affected total IPSM scores. The   suggests that in both males and females interpersonal sensitivity is increased by dysfunctional   by the same-sex s."
Parenting style as an investment in human development,2019,"We propose a household production function approach to human development that explicitly considers the role of   in  rearing. Specifically,   is modeled as an investment that depends not only on inputs of time and market goods, but  on attention. Our model relates socioeconomic disadvantage to   and human development through the constraints that disadvantage places on cognitive capacity. We find empirical support for key features of our model.   is a construct that is distinctive to standard al investments and is important for young-adult outcomes. Effective   are negatively correlated with disadvantage."
Parent-Child Aggression: Association With Child Abuse Potential and Parenting Styles,2010,"The  investigation predicted that greater use of corporal punishment as well as physical maltreatment would be associated with  abuse potential and selected  . Three independent studies were examined, two with community samples and a third with a clinical at-risk sample of s. s across all studies anonymously completed the Child Abuse Potential Inventory, the -Child Conflict Tactics Scale to assess physical discipline and maltreatment, as well as the  Scale to measure dysfunctional- . Findings support that overall - aggression, as well as physical maltreatment behaviors specifically, were associated with  abuse potential. - aggression was  related to dysfunctional  , particularly an overreactive, authoritarian  . Permissive  was  identified as potentially associated with physical maltreatment, although the findings regarding such lax   are less clear. Intriguing findings emerged regarding the connection of psychological aggression to both  abuse potential and dysfunctional  . Child abuse potential was  associated with dysfunctional  , particularly harsh, overreactive approaches. Recommendations for future  with at-risk samples and additional  on permissive  and psychological aggression are discussed."
Consistency analysis of parenting styles in Thailand during 's first year,2012,"This descriptive  identifies and examines the consistency of   during the first year of their 's lives. The data were collected from interviewing 4088 s or primary care takers of the 6 month old infants during the third wave of data collection of The Prospective Cohort of Thai Children project. The instrument used was the Infant  Styles Questionnaire, developed by the ers, which reflected al responses to infant care in five different situations. After the answers were categorized into controlling, reasoning, overprotection, and neglectful  , the weighted kappa was used for the consistency analysis. The findings revealed that during the first 6 months of life, the overprotection  was the most common, followed by the reasoning . The controlling and neglectful  were very seldom used. The consistency of the al  in the same care givers using the kappa values showed that agreement between each of the  was very low (-0.0419 to 0.0688). This suggests that   during the first year of life seem to occur in random patterns."
Parenting style and prosocial behaviour among Chinese Preschool : A moderation model,,"The   examines the relationship between   and the development of prosocial behaviour of preschool  in China and how this relationship is moderated by family income, an everchanging factor caused by rapid economic development in modern China. A total of 188 s of preschool  responded to the questionnaires covering both family   and prosocial behaviour scales for preschool . The  showed that democratic   has a significantly positive prediction on the total score and all dimensions of prosocial behaviour whereas neglecting   is significantly and negatively correlated with the total score and dimensions of sharing and comfort in the prosocial behaviour. Authoritarian   negatively predicts the morality dimension of the prosocial behaviour. Moreover, family income significantly moderates the relationship between   and prosocial behaviour. The  suggest the importance of adopting positive   to cultivate preschool 's prosocial behaviour."
Parenting styles and alcohol consumption among Brazilian adolescents,2012,"Aim: This  evaluates the correlation between alcohol consumption in adolescence and   of socialization among Brazilian adolescents. The sample was composed of 273 adolescents, 58% whom were males. Instruments were: 1) Sociodemographic Questionnaire; 2) Demand and Responsiveness Scales; 3) Drug Use Screening Inventory (DUSI).

Results: Maternal, but not paternal, authoritative and authoritarian   were directly related to adolescent alcohol intake. Conclusions: The  that mothers use to interact with their  may influence uptake of high-risk behaviors."
"Parenting Style, Parental Feeding Practices and Children's Nutritional Status in Authoritative Parenting Style Model: A Structural Equation Modeling",2017,"Background: The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in  has posed some challenges in many countries. There is a relationship between  , al feeding practices, and 's nutritional status. Objectives: This  aimed to apply Authoritative   Model in 's nutritional status. Methods: This  was a cross-sectional  conducted on 1000 s selected by random cluster sampling. s who had primary school  aged 7-8 years in Bojnord, Iran, completed questionnaires related to the constructs of the model in 2016. Structural Equation Model Model (SEM) analysis was used to test the fit of the model. CMIN/DF, GFI, IFI, CFI, PGFI, PNFI, and RMSEA indices were employed to check the goodness-of-fit. Results: Correctly completed questionnaires were collected from 294 dyads of s. The mean age was 36.26 years (SD = +/- 5.38) in fathers and 32.96 years (SD = +/- 4.88) in mothers. 232 mothers (80.5 %) were housewives and only 99 of them (34.4%) had university education. Most fathers were employee (115, 40%) or self-employed (111, 38.5%) and 120 of them (41.7%) had university education. The values of goodness-of-fit were obtained for CMIN/DF = 4.6, GFI = 0.91, CFI = 0.93, IFI = 0.92, PGFI = 0.68, PNFI = 0.77, and RMSEA = 0.07. Nutritional knowledge and attitude directly affected authoritative   (beta = 0.21, P<0.001) andal feeding practices (beta = 0.33, P < 0.001) and indirectly affected 's nutritional status (beta = -0.01). The authoritative   construct had a direct effect on feeding practices of s (beta = 0.54, P < 0.001) and an indirect effect on 's nutritional status (beta = -0.01). The feeding practices of s construct  affected the 's nutritional status directly (beta = -0.02, P < 0.05). Conclusions: This  indicated that the use of this model in the 's nutritional status can  in positive outcomes, and this model can make interventions more effective in this regard."
Parenting Style and Reactive and Proactive Adolescent Violence: Evidence from Spain,2018,"The aim of the   was to analyze the relationship between the  authoritative, indulgent, authoritarian, and neglectfuland reactive and proactive school violence among peers. These analyses were  performed by sex and age groups. The sample consisted of 2399 Spanish adolescents (50.2% male), aged between 12 and 18 years, mean (M) = 14.69, standard deviation (SD) = 1.82. A multivariate analisys of variance (MANOVA, 4 x 2 x 2) was applied, considering  , sex, and age group (12-14 and 15-18 years) as independent variables to analyze the possible effects of interaction. Reactive, proactive, and pure violence were the dependent variables. The  showed the main effects of  , sex, and age, as well as an interaction between sex, age, and  . The interpretation of the findings suggested that the authoritarian   was related to greater engagement in proactive and reactive violent behaviors. In relation to the effect of the interaction between sex, age, and  , it was observed that adolescents from indulgent families, of both sexes and in any of the studied age groups, obtained lower scores in proactive violence. The discussion highlights the importance of affection and warmth for well-adjusted 's behavior."
Parenting styles and  to parent violence in Spanish population,2012,"The aims of this  were to examine the prevalence of -to- violence in a Spanish sample and to analyze the relationship between   (authoritative, authoritarian, indulgent, and negligent) and -to- violence. Participants in this  were 1343 Spanish university students (74% females; mean age=21.21; SD=4.21) who reported whether they had used any kind of violence against their s during their early adolescence. The prevalence of -to- verbal abuse ranged from 2.4% to 69%, depending on the type of verbal abuse considered. For the case of physical aggression against one's s, the rate was around 5%. As far as   were concerned, the negligent  increased the probability of physical and verbal abuse against s. The authoritarian   was significantly associated with -to- verbal abuse, but not with physical abuse. Finally, the indulgent   did not increase the probability of -to- violence, and this finding was in line with those from previous studies with Spanish samples."
"Parenting style, distress, and problematic alcohol use in Bhutan",2019,"Background: Bhutan is a small landlocked country located between India and China that is largely rural and Buddhist. As the nation develops and adopts more Western practices, the nature of the relationship between its young people and alcohol is developing as well. Objectives: The   examines how problematic alcohol use relates to   and distress in a sample of predominantly tertiary students. Methods: For this , 245 young adults completed self-report measures of  , distress, and alcohol-related problems. Results: Strong correlations were found indicating that more dysfunctional   were associated with greater distress and problematic alcohol use. Further analyses to evaluate the relationship between   and alcohol use found no role for moderation but a significant mediation which indicated that more dysfunctional   were associated with greater distress which in turn was associated with greater problematic alcohol use. Conclusions: These findings replicate those found in Western countries and imply that the same vulnerabilities to problematic alcohol use are   in Bhutan."
Parenting styles and alcohol use among adolescents: A longitudinal study,2016,"  has been identified as one of the most important risk and protective factors for substance use in adolescents. Evidence suggests that the influence of each   on adolescent's substance use varies across countries. Research studies with Spanish population have been mostly restricted to cross-sectional designs, limiting the interpretation of directionality in the relationship between   and adolescent substance use. This longitudinal  explores the predictive validity of perceived   on prospective drug use and alcohol related problems in a sample of adolescents. Participants were 346 adolescents (53.64% males) who were assessed twice in a period of two years. In the first wave participants were 12.89 years old (SD = 0.54). Logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the prospective relationship between perceived   at first wave and substance involvement outcomes at the second. Adolescents that perceived their s as neglectful had higher risk of developing an alcohol use disorder two years later [odds ratio (OR) : 2.14; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18-3.86 (p = .012)]. The findings of this  indicate that special attention should be given to those adolescents who perceived their   as neglectful."
"Perceived parenting styles, thinking styles, and gender on the career decision self-efficacy of adolescents: how & why?",2021,"Career decision self-efficacy (CDSE), i.e., the ability to successfully make important career-related decisions, is influenced by perceived  , thinking , and gender. Thus, this non-experimental  examined the effects of these factors on the CDSE of 617 high school students in Jakarta, Indonesia. According to the measuring instruments (CDSE Scale-Short Form, al Authority Questionnaire, and Thinking and Styles Inventory-Revised II), the adolescents' CDSE was influenced by the authoritative and permissive  , and three types of thinking . Moreover, the thinking  mediated the relationship between the perceived   and CDSE, while gender acted as a homologizer."
Nonresident Fathers' Parenting Style and the Adjustment of Late-Adolescent Boys,2012,"This  investigates the relation between nonresident fathers'  , mothers'   and behaviors, and depression and antisocial behavior in a sample of late-adolescent boys (n = 177). Hierarchical regression analyses were performed. Maternal psychological well-being was associated with fewer adolescent depression symptoms. When mothers had low or average amounts of aggravation in , fathers' more authoritative  was related to fewer depression symptoms in their adolescents. Maternal aggravation in  was associated with adolescent antisocial behavior. When mothers had low or average levels of authoritative , fathers' more authoritative  was related to less antisocial behavior in their adolescents."
"Parenting styles, school wellbeing and school performance in adolescence",2019,"This  examines school wellbeing in a sample of 536 students enrolled in the first class of 7 different Italian high school in order to: 1) describe the level of school wellbeing and school performance; 2) investigate the relationship between school wellbeing and school performance; 3) explore the role of maternal and paternal   in predicting academic achievement; 4) explore the role of maternal and paternal   in predicting school well-being. Our  indicate that males report higher levels of school wellbeing and lower levels of school performance than females. Wellbeing ed to be associated to school performance, both among males and females. Among males a better school performance is associated with authoritative maternal ; among females it is negatively associated with permissive and authoritarian . As for school wellbeing, for males it is positively associated with authoritative maternal and paternal . Among females, authoritative maternal  is associated with higher levels of school wellbeing, while maternal authoritarian  and maternal and paternal permissive  are associated with a lower level of school wellbeing."

The long arm of parenting: How parenting styles influence crime and the pathways that explain this effect*,2021,"Although several criminological theories suggest that variations in  increase the probability of adult crime, most studies limit focus to the association between  and adolescent delinquency. Thus,  exploring the association between  and adult crime is rare. The   used path analyses and prospective, longitudinal data from a sample of 318 African American men to examine the effects of eight   on adult crime. Furthermore, we investigated the extent to which significant  effects are mediated by criminogenic schemas, negative emotions, peer affiliations, adult transitions, and involvement with the criminal justice system. Consonant with the  hypotheses, the  indicated that   with high demandingness, regardless of whether it co-occurred with responsiveness or corporal punishment, reduced the risk of adult crime. On the other hand,   low on demandingness but high on responsiveness or corporal punishment were associated with a robust increase in risk for adult crime. These  effects were mediated, in large measure, by criminogenic schemas and affiliation with adult deviant peers. The findings held after taking into account the effect of adolescent experiences and traits such as delinquency, deviant peer affiliations, community violence, discrimination, negative emotionality, and poor self-control."
Contributions of parenting styles and parental drunkenness to adolescent drinking,2019,"Objective: To estimate the association of al drunkenness and   with alcohol consumption among adolescents and the contributions of al drunkenness and   to the prevalence of binge drinking among adolescents. Method: Cross-sectional survey of a reative sample of secondary students aged 13 to 18 from 27 Brazilian state capitals (n=17,028). Private and public schools were included. A self-report questionnaire collected data on adolescents' alcohol drinking behavior,  , and  and peer models of drunkenness. Results: Non-authoritative   and al drunkenness are associated with binge drinking among adolescents. Authoritarian, indulgent, and negligent   were associated with 1.50-, 2.51-, and 2.82-fold increases in prevalence of adolescent binge drinking, and al drunkenness, with a 1.99-fold increase. The non-authoritative   made a larger contribution than al drunkenness to adolescent binge drinking. Conclusions: Non-authoritative   and al drunkenness seem to play an important role in adolescents' binge drinking behavior. At the population level,   appears associated with a greater contribution to this behavior among adolescents. Prevention strategies targeting al drunkenness may be bolstered if a broader approach including   is in place."
How do parents perceive the returns to parenting styles and neighborhoods?,2021,"This paper studies al beliefs about the returns to two factors affecting the development and long-term outcomes of : (i)   defined by warmth and control s employ in raising , and (ii) neighborhood quality. Based on a reative sample of 2,119 s in the United States, I show that s perceive large returns to the warmth dimension of  as well as neighborhood quality, and document that they perceive  to compensate for the lack of a good environment. I introduce a measurement error correction to show that perceived returns relate to s' actual  behavior and families' neighborhood choices, but document that beliefs are unlikely to explain existing socioeconomic differences."
Parenting Styles Affecting the Social Behaviour of Five-Year Olds,2010,"The main aim of the  was to explore the relationship between   as a correlate of social behaviour among five-year olds. Participants were 30 s of 25 pre-primary students of a school in Northern Province of South Africa, and the 's teacher. The participants were mostly of the indigenous African ethnic background. The s completed the al Styles Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ: Robinson, Mandleco, Olsen & Hart, 2001).

Parenting style and second order personality factors in HSPQ,1999,"Processing the data from the sample of 1405 adolescents (aging from 15 to 17 years from different places in Bohemia) statistically significant relations between Cattells personality factors of higher order and indicators of family   were found. On the level of higher order factors the relation between   and some aspects of  personality is assessed more sensitively than on the level of first order factors; it concerns especially the social extraversion introversion. The relations found were differentiated according to separate factors, different indicators of family  , including the differences between the fathers and mothers  , and according to differences between boys and girls. The importance of   of both s and their communication with the  was shown, including some specific features in fathers and mothers in their relations to sons and daughters. Some relations found support acid further enlarge the already gained knowledge concerning the family upbringing, communication in family, and personality development. The further relations can be hypothetically explained on the basis of prior knowledge and experience. A number of partial findings brings the open questions that call for the further ."
Parenting styles and stress in students of compulsory secondary education,2011,"The main purpose of this  was to examine any possible existing connection between  , as perceived by a group of teenagers, and the level of concern shown at a group of daily stressors among this stage in development. In addition, it was studied whether the reported level of stress was subjected to change related to gender. 495 students of compulsory secondary education ranging between 12 and 16 participated in the . The  obtained revealed that those adolescents with s exhibiting a permissive  showed a lower level of stress compared to those belonging to authoritarian homes. Furthermore, gender-related differences were only found in one of the stressor categories. The  are discussed appealing to an ecological model of human development.

Maternal Parenting Style in Relation to Parenting Stress and Behavioral Outcomes in Japanese Children with and without Autism,2020,"This exploratory  sought to compare the  variables of  stress, perceived social support, and   among Japanese mothers (n = 42) of  with autism and those (n = 36) without autism, and examine associations between 's internalizing and externalizing behaviors and these variables by using  questionnaires. Results of independent t-tests revealed increased  stress symptoms among mothers of  with autism and lower levels of social support.   did not significantly differ between the groups. Regression analyses revealed that  stress predicted externalizing behaviors in  with autism. Additionally, an authoritarian   was predictive of externalizing behaviors in  without autism.  stress was  related to authoritarian and permissive  in both groups. These findings highlight the need for interventions and mental health services that reduce  stress and improve maternal well-being, and therefore, enhance - interactions."

Many decades of  have supported the impact of   on several aspects of the social and emotional adjustment of  and adolescents. The purpose of this  was to examine the psychometric properties and the factorial validity of the Portuguese version of the  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire, through confirmatory factor analysis. Data were collected from 2081 participants (1085 mothers; 996 fathers) with  between 3 and 15 years old. Results replicated the original three-factor structure: authoritative, authoritarian and permissive. The  of confirmatory analysis indicated a good fit of the model. Authoritative and authoritarian factors showed good internal reliability coefficients, but the permissive factor ed values slightly below acceptable levels. Convergent and discriminant validity  showed appropriate values. In general, and despite the less acceptable levels of internal reliability demonstrated by the permissive factor, PSDQ revealed psychometric properties appropriate for  and clinical purposes. This instrument not only allows for the assessment of  , but  enables the measurement of al dimensions and behaviors with a significant impact on  and adolescent well-being."
Efficacy of Lithuanian Systematic Training for Effective Parenting (STEP) on Parenting Style and Perception of Child Behavior,2015,"The short- and long-term efficacy of the Adlerian  education program Systematic Training for Effective  (STEP), which is the group-based  class model, was the focus of the current  in Lithuania.

Furthermore, the  have finally provided the Lithuanian therapists,  educators, and s with an evidence-based  program as recommended by the Council of Europe."
The Moderating Role of Parenting Styles in Adolescents' Bullying and Depression,2021,"Background: Bullying others among school-aged youth is a worldwide phenomenon that has a variety of adverse outcomes, depression being one of them. Objective: The objective of the current  was to examine whether perceived   moderated the relationship between bullying others and depression among adolescents. It was hypothesized that perceived authoritarian  would increase the association between bullying others and depression than non-authoritarian s. Methods: The sample included 116 adolescents aged 12-17, with a mean age of 13.87. The percentage of male participants was 47.41%. We used self-report questionnaires, which measured the different variables in the  (bullying, perceptions of  , and depression). Results: A positive correlation between bullying others and depressive symptoms was found. Bullying others and perceived authoritarian   were  correlated, and a positive correlation was found between perceived authoritarian   and depressive symptoms. The moderation effect of perceived   on the association between bullying others and depressive symptoms was found significant. Among adolescents perceiving their s as authoritarian, the association between bullying others and depressive symptoms was found to be stronger. In contrast, among adolescents perceiving their s as non-authoritarian, the association was low. Conclusion: Results of this  have important clinical implications by understanding the  component in the association between bullying others and depression. Our  suggest that the psychological outcomes for bullies may depend, among other things, on their perception of s'  ."
Mindful feeding: A pathway between parenting style and  eating behaviors,2020,"Certain  eating behaviors (e.g., food fussiness, emotional overeating, and disruptive mealtime behaviors) can create challenges for caregivers and  in short- and long-term health consequences (e.g., lower fruit and vegetable intake, a deficiency of essential nutrients, greater intake of energy-dense foods and sugary beverages, and/or higher BMI) for the . The role of mindful feeding-cultivating a -centered awareness in the feeding context to increase s' awareness of their own responsive (and non-responsive) feeding behaviors-has not been explored as it relates to  and 's problematic eating behaviors. The objective of this  was to understand whether the relations between   and  eating behaviors often documented in the literature are mediated by mindful feeding. Using self-reports from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) of 496 mothers and fathers of young  (age 2-7 years old), we explored whether mindful feeding mediates the relation between   and  eating behaviors. As hypothesized, authoritative  was related to higher rates of mindful feeding (beta = .16, 95% C.I. [.05, .18]), while authoritarian (beta = - .34, 95% C.I. [-.32, -.17]) and permissive  (beta = -.15, 95% C.I. [-.18, -.05]) were related to lower rates of mindful feeding. Mindful feeding mediated the relation between each   and each  eating behavior (i.e., food fussiness, problematic mealtime behaviors, and emotional overeating). These findings suggest that that mindful feeding may be a promising new construct, and its relation to feeding interventions aimed at improving problematic  eating behaviors should be further evaluated."
"Pontificating the relationship between parenting styles and academic performance of senior high school students in the Kumasi Metropolis, Ghana",2021,"The  analysed the relationship between   and academic performance of senior high school students in the Kumasi Metropolis. Convenience and simple random sampling techniques were used to select the schools and 376 respondents, respectively. Pearson's Correlation Coefficient Matrix and multiple ordinary least square were used to estimate the impact of   on academic performance. The  found that authoritative   had greatest significant positive impact on academic performance of the students (beta = 0.104, SE = 0.011,t = 9.539,p < 0.001), followed by authoritarian  (beta = 0.044, SE = 0.011,t = 3.971,p < 0.001). However, permissive  had no significant impact on students' academic performance (beta = 0.042, SE = 0.025,t = - 1.682,p = 0.093). Neglecting  had significant negative impact on students' academic performance (beta = 0.072, SE = 0.011,t = - 6.740,p < 0.001). Following from the  findings, it is recommended that the Schools in collaboration with the  Teacher Association should organise guidance and counselling programs for s to sensitise them on various   and their ramifications on academic performance of students. Also, Class Counsellors' professional capabilities to manage the psycho-social problems of students are imperative for an improved academic performance of the latter."

Previous  has established relations with regard to the impact of  feeding strategies on  mealtime behaviors and how  feeding strategies are influenced by  ; however, to our knowledge, no studies have investigated whether there is an association between   and perceived  mealtime behaviors specifically related to picky eating. Objective: The purpose of this  was to investigate whether a relation exists between general   and both  feeding strategies and perceived picky eater and non-picky eater (NPE) behaviors. Methods: s of 2-to 5-y-old  (n = 525) completed 2 online surveys: 1) the Mealtime Assessment Survey, which measures the frequency of  and  mealtime behaviors, and 2) the  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire, which measures authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive  . Spearman's correlation analysis was conducted to determine the relations between   and mealtime behavior. Results: Positive correlations were found between an authoritative   and NPE behaviors, as well as  mealtime strategies that promote positive eating habits. Authoritarian and permissive   were positively correlated with  behaviors associated with picky eating and  mealtime strategies that can negatively influence  feeding. Conclusions: These findings suggest that a relation exists between general   and both  and  mealtime behaviors; however, the directionality of the relation remains unknown. The positive correlations seen within the authoritative   with regard to NPE behaviors suggest the use of authoritative feeding methods to overcome feeding difficulties."

Parenting Styles: A Closer Look at a Well-Known Concept,2019,"Although   constitute a well-known concept in  , two issues have largely been overlooked in existing studies. In particular, the psychological control dimension has rarely been explicitly modelled and there is limited insight into joint   that simultaneously characterize maternal and paternal practices and their impact on  development. Using data from a sample of 600 Flemish families raising an 8-to-10 year old , we identified naturally occurring joint  . A cluster analysis based on two  dimensions (al support and behavioral control) revealed four congruent  : an authoritative, positive authoritative, authoritarian and uninvolved  . A subsequent cluster analysis comprising three  dimensions (al support, behavioral and psychological control) yielded similar cluster profiles for the congruent (positive) authoritative and authoritarian  , while the fourth   was relabeled as a congruent intrusive  . ANOVAs demonstrated that having (positive) authoritative s associated with the most favorable outcomes, while having authoritarian s coincided with the least favorable outcomes. Although less pronounced than for the authoritarian , having intrusive s  associated with poorer  outcomes. Results demonstrated that accounting for al psychological control did not yield additional  , but enhanced our understanding of the pattern among the three  dimensions within each   and their association with  outcomes. More similarities than dissimilarities in the  of both s emerged, although adding psychological control slightly enlarged the differences between the scores of mothers and fathers."
"Parenting styles, family structure and adolescent dietary behaviour",2010,"Objective: To examine associations between  , family structure and aspects of adolescent dietary behaviour. Design: Cross-sectional . Setting: Secondary schools in the East Midlands, UK. Subjects: Adolescents aged 12-16 years (77 328, 57% boys) completed an FFQ assessing their consumption of fruit, vegetables, unhealthy snacks and breakfast. Adolescents provided information on al and sibling status and completed a seventeen-item instrument measuring the general   dimensions of involvement and strictness, from which four  were derived: indulgent, neglectful, authoritarian, authoritative. Results: After controlling for adolescent gender and age, analysis of covariance revealed no significant interactions between   and family structure variables for any of the dietary behaviours assessed. Significant main effects for family structure were observed only for breakfast consumption, with adolescents from dual- families (P<0.01) and those with no brothers (P<0.05) eating breakfast on more days per week than those from single- families and those with one or more brother, respectively. Significant main effects for   were observed for all dietary behaviours apart from vegetable consumption. Adolescents who described their s as authoritative ate more fruit per day, fewer unhealthy snacks per clay, and ate breakfast on more days per week than those who described their s as neglectful. Conclusions: The positive associations between authoritative   and adolescent dietary behaviour transcend family structure. Future  should be food-specific and assess the efficacy of strategies promoting the central attributes of an authoritative   on the dietary behaviours of adolescents from a variety of family structures."

This  assessed the relationship between   and changes in body mass index (BMI) from adolescence to young adulthood. Method: The  included self-reported data from adolescents in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Factor mixture modeling, a data-driven approach, was used to classify participants into   groups based on measures of acceptance and control. Latent growth modeling (LGM) identified patterns of developmental changes in BMI. After a number of potential confounders were controlled for,   variables were entered as predictors of BMI trajectories. Analyses were  conducted for male and female individuals of 3 racial-ethnic groups (Hispanic, Black, White) to assess whether   were differentially associated with BMI trajectories in these 6 groups. Results:   were classified into 4 groups: authoritarian, disengaged, permissive, and balanced. Compared with the balanced  , authoritarian and disengaged   were associated with a less steep average BMI increase (linear slope) over time, but  less leveling off (quadratic) of BMI over time. Differences in BMI trajectories were observed for various genders and races, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: Adolescents who reported having s with authoritarian or disengaged   had greater increases in BMI as they transitioned to young adulthood despite having a lower BMI trajectory through adolescence."

The role of parenting styles and teacher interactional styles in 's reading and spelling development,2012,"This  examined the associations between  , teacher interactional , and 's reading and spelling skills. The sample consisted of 864 Finnish-speaking  and their s (864 mothers, 864 fathers) and teachers (N=123). Children's risk for reading disabilities and reader status were assessed in kindergarten. Children were  tested on reading and spelling skills in Grades 1 and 2.   and teacher interactional  were measured using s' and teachers' self-reports in Grade 1. First, the  indicated that both an authoritative   and authoritative teacher interactional  positively predicted 's spelling skill development. Second, authoritative  was particularly beneficial for the spelling skill development of  who were at risk for reading disabilities. Third, authoritative teaching promoted spelling skill development particularly among  who were nonreaders in kindergarten but had no risk for reading disabilities. Finally, some evidence was found that authoritative teaching could compensate for the negative impact of nonauthoritative  on reading development among kindergarten nonreaders.

Parenting styles and home literacy opportunities: Associations with 's oral language skills,2017,"This  examined associations among  , home literacy practices, and 's language skills. A total of 181 ethnically diverse s, primarily African American, and their preschool-aged  participated. Results suggest that an authoritative   was positively associated with informal home literacy (book reading) practices and formal literacy (al teaching) practices whereas an authoritarian   was negatively associated with informal home literacy practices. Informal home literacy experience was positively and s' teaching literacy was negatively related to 's oral language scores. In a mediational model, s who were more likely to have authoritative   provided their  with informal (reading) home literacy experiences, which in turn, was associated with 's oral language skill.  education was positively related to home literacy experiences and directly related to 's oral language skill. Findings suggest that ers should acknowledge multiple aspects of  when considering relations among home literacy practices and 's language and literacy development. Highlights   is associated with s' engagement in home literacy activities with . The relation between   and 's oral language skills is mediated by the home literacy environment.  education has a strong and direct impact on 's oral language skills."
Testing the alleged superiority of the indulgent parenting style among Spanish adolescents,2016,"Background: While international studies have reported the superiority of the authoritative  (which combines al involvement with demandingness), some studies in Spain and in other countries have found that the indulgent  (involvement without demandingness) might be just as good or even better. This  aims to discern whether the differences are cultural or methodological. Method: 306 adolescents from high schools in Madrid and Valencia (Spain) answered a questionnaire that included two   instruments (SOC-30 and PSI), together with a self-esteem scale (AF5) and a question on academic performance. Results: Concordance between the two instruments assessing   was poor. When associating   (according to the SOC-30) with outcomes (self-esteem and academic achievement),  were similar to previous studies in Spain. But if we use the PSI,  were similar to studies in Anglophone countries: the authoritative  achieved the best outcomes. Conclusions: The discrepancies found between studies carried out in Spain and in Anglophone countries do not seem to be due to differences between cultures, but to methodological differences (i.e., differences between the instruments used). If we use the same instruments that were used in Anglophone countries, the most effective   is still the authoritative."

Adolescents who perceived their s as authoritarian had a decreased autonomy and those who perceived their s as permissive had a diminished personal growth."
Facets of Adult Social Competence as Predictors of Parenting Style,2016,"A wealth of  suggests that   influences the social development of . Similarly, it seems reasonable that the environments s create for their  will be predicted by their social competencies. There is limited  examining what facets of adult social competence predict  . The   contributes to the literature by examining the relationship between multiple facets of adult social competence and overall quality of   as assessed by s. Four-hundred s completed self-report measures evaluating their   and seven facets of their social competence including: emotional intelligence, assertion, conflict management, empathy, agency, communion, and social support. Stepwise regression was used to examine the additional contribution made to the prediction of   quality after first accounting for  and  sexes and ages, and frequency of  misbehavior. Results suggest that the aforementioned facets of social competence can account for approximately 25 % of the variance beyond control factors. Further  is needed to examine whether enhancing facets of adult social competence can improve how s engage with their ."
Parenting styles and academic achievement of young adolescents: A systematic literature review,2015,"Literature accords the importance of   and their impact on young adolescent's behavior. There are many factors that affect the academic performance of  and   is one of the significant factors of academic performance. But there is lack of  that integrates and systemizes the relationship between   and academic performance especially in Pakistan. The unit of analysis of this  was studies that were previously conducted on   and academic performance of young . Main focus of search was to availability of data that is most recent and relevant, so this  paper focuses on 39 studies. Articles from seven databases (Google Scholar, Science Direct, Taylor and Francis Journals, Web of Science, JSTOR, Springer link and SAGE Journals) were identified related to the topic using a pre-established set of terms that included both   and academic performance. All the studies highlighted that   affect the academic achievement of adolescents. It was analyzed that authoritative   is the most effective   in enhancing the academic performance of young . More  is needed on   in different continents to have an understanding of the cultural effect of   on the academic performance of adolescents. Implications for s and policy makers are discussed."
Perceptions of Parenting Style Among College Students in India and the United States,2013,"Although a growing body of psychological literature has examined the influence of culture on  , relatively less attention has been paid to gender differences in   across cultures. The   examined perceptions of   as a function of participant's culture, participant's gender, and  gender in college students in India and the United States. Using a new vignette-based self-report measure that characterizes each of Baumrind's three  , participants rated perceptions of effectiveness, helpfulness, caring, and normativeness of each . Contrary to expectation,  showed that Indian college students considered the  demonstrating permissive  to be more effective and helpful than US college students. In contrast, US college students considered the s demonstrating authoritative and authoritarian  to be more effective, helpful, and caring than Indian college students. A majority of Indian and US college students selected the  demonstrating authoritative  as most similar to their own s, and the type of  they wish to be in the future. Females considered the  demonstrating authoritative  to be more effective and helpful than males. Relatively few effects of  gender were found."
A Person-oriented Approach to Identifying Parenting Styles in Mothers of Early School-age Children,2015,"A substantial body of work has been dedicated to understanding the behaviours that characterize mothers' interactions with their . Most  on  has used a variable-oriented approach, limiting analysis to one or a few  behaviours and failing to identify higher-order interactions or patterns among variables. Thus, little is known about how different behaviours co-occur in individual mothers to form  of . In this , a person-oriented approach was used to develop a typology of maternal   based on a broad range of observed and self-reported  behaviours. The  sample consisted of 408 socio-demographically diverse mother- pairs. Cluster analysis revealed six  groups(1) balanced ; (2) warm/involved ; (3) task-focused ; (4) detached/inconsistent ; (5) intrusive ; and (6) self-critical two of which (task-focused and self-critical ) have not been previously reed in the  literature. The maternal  typology developed through this  provides useful information on the profiles of  behaviour that are associated with the highest levels of demographic and psychological risk in mothers who exhibit these profiles.

The power of authoritative parenting: A cross-national study of effects of exposure to different parenting styles on life satisfaction,2020,"The impact of authoritative, permissive, and authoritarian   on life satisfaction was analysed on the basis of survey data from national reative samples of young people between the ages of 14 and 29 in ten countries of Southeast Europe. The , based on multiple linear regression analysis and two-step cluster analysis, showed that in each of the ten countries observed, being exposed to more authoritative  during elementary school was strongly correlated with higher levels of life satisfaction during the period of youth. While the other two types of  were weakly and inconsistently correlated to life satisfaction across the ten countries, analysis of the effects of specific combinations of   showed that the pure authoritarian   had a substantial negative impact on life satisfaction in each of the ten countries observed. Overall, the  of our  offer very strong support for the notion that, even from a wider cross-national perspective, exposure to an authoritative   during hood is conducive to higher levels of life satisfaction in later years. Our   suggest that even the effects of both permissive and authoritarian  tend to be positive, as long as these  are combined with the authoritative one. Thus, when it comes to exposure to different   during hood, lack of authoritative  was identified as the most important factor in lower life satisfaction among young people."
Divinity rules: towards a revised typology of multinational corporate parenting styles,2017,"We advance a revised and extended typology of multinational corporate   designed to capture different approaches identifiable in multinational headquarter - subsidiary interactions. Invoking ancient Greek mythology, we propose a four-way classification of the observed dominant . Multinational corporations pursuing a Cronus   emphasise exploitation and demonstrate a proclivity for continuously extracting value from their subsidiary units. Multinationals following a Rhea   focus on adding value to their subsidiaries and place a strong emphasis on care and accommodation in -subsidiary interactions. Zeus  multinational s encourage heroism among their offspring, something that is commonly leveraged through adding financial value to the subsidiary and extracting a range of other types of value in return. Those multinational s pursuing an Athena   place an emphasis on developing and safeguarding wisdom in their subsidiaries and display a continuous desire for a balanced exchange of value in their on-going interactions."

Relationship of recalled parenting style to self-perception in Korean American college students,2003,"The authors examined the relationship of authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive   and the number of years in the United States with self-perception (academic competence, morality, and self-reliance) as recalled by Korean American college students (N = 144). Authoritative  behaviors were most common in Korean American families, followed by authoritarian behaviors, with permissive behaviors a distant 3rd. Authoritative   and the number of years lived in the United States were predictive of higher academic competence. Authoritarian and permissive   were predictive of lower self-reliance, whereas number of years lived in the United States was related to higher self-reliance. Those findings provide partial support for generalizing D. Baumrind's (1971) model of   to Korean American families, and the findings demonstrate the importance of considering acculturation issues in  studies."
Parenting Styles: The Impact on Student Achievement,2008,"  and its impact on student achievement in a multidimensional society continues to pose significant challenges to clinicians, ers, educators, and s alike. This literature review summarizes the  surrounding five domains: (1) al control; (2) gender and  ; (3) al education; (4) perceptual differences between s and their ; and (5) ethnicity and diversity. Behavioral control and psychological control were found to be two inherent features of al  that have a direct affect on student achievement. Adolescents' perceived level of independence when interacting with their s  seemed to have a direct relationship on their academic achievement. Research concerning 's progress in mathematics as related to   and gender stereotype was  uncovered. Evidence was found to support the notion that al education can have an indirect impact on 's academic achievement in various cultures. Implications for future  are identified including the need for applied  in learning communities factoring in variables for family structure, expectations, ethnicity, communication, and involvement."

"Children's Aggression, Parenting Styles, and Distress for Hong Kong Parents",2013,"This  examined the connection between al perceptions about their 's reactive and proactive aggression,  , - communication, and al distress. A total of 1,485 Hong Kong s and guardians with  8 to 17 years old completed the Reactive and Proactive Aggression Questionnaire, Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, Adjective Checklist, and  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire. When reactive and proactive aggression responses were used to predict al distress, a significant regression model was obtained with both predictors making a contribution. A significant model  was discovered when   and - communication were used to predict al distress. Authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive  contributed significantly to this model. One final regression was performed with the significant predictors from the two previous equations. This model was significant, with reactive and proactive aggression, and authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive   making significant contributions.

The findings indicated that   (authoritarian, authoritative, permissive/indulgent, and permissive/neglecting), which were constructed by crossing perceived al acceptance/involment and strict control dimensions of  were consistently related with the major outcome variables. Authoritarian and permissive/indulgent   were found to be the most com,non  rearing practices among Turkish s. As compared to those from authoritarian and negletful families, participants from authoritative and indulgent families were more likely to have secure attachment (and less likely to have insecure attachment), high levels of self-esteem and self-concept clarity, and low, levels of trait anxiety.  dimensions perceived from mothers were primarily related with attachment variables and those dimensions perceived from fathers were primarily related with the self variables.

EXPLORING THE DEVELOPMENT OF PERFECTIONISM: THE INFLUENCE OF PARENTING STYLE AND GENDER,2014,"In this  we explored the associations between different combinations of the  characteristics of demands and warmth, and distinct dimensions of perfectionism. A secondary purpose was to examine whether or not these associations vary by gender. Results indicated that an authoritarian   was associated with more maladaptive aspects of perfectionism (e.g., concerns about mistakes, doubting one's abilities), whereas authoritative  seemed to buffer individuals from these maladaptive aspects. In general, indulgent  was associated with fewer feelings of criticism from s, whereas neglectful  was related to more feelings of criticism. None of the  , however, was related to adaptive perfectionism (e.g., personal standards, organization). Apart from a few noteworthy exceptions, patterns of association were similar for males and females."
Associations between  mobile use and digital parenting style in Hungarian families,2020,"Mobile touch screen device (MTSDs) use is becoming widespread in  and has negative and positive consequences. Yet, factors associated with greater use remain unexplored, despite the importance of their identification for intervention purposes. It stands to reason that s can influence  MTSD use, via their attitudes, beliefs, role-modelling, and  of . Here, we examined the associations between these al characteristics and  MTSD use and whether   specifically with regard to  MTSD use exist. Hungarian s (N = 1283) were surveyed about their 's digital activities, their own attitudes and beliefs regarding the 's MTSD use, and their own attachment to- and use of mobile phones. Taking a data-driven approach, distinct digital   were identified and these resembled general  . Findings further suggested that  spent more time with MTSD use if their s: were more permissive, more authoritative and less authoritarian; had a lower educational level; exhibited greater attachment to their mobile phones; and had more positive attitudes towards, and attributed less harm and more benefits to, early device use. These  are the first evidence for existence of digital   and suggest that al characteristics are potential prevention and treatment targets."

Therefore, stimulating creative abilities forms an important objective for educators and professionals.   that includes daily -rearing practices, creativity specific - interactions, and perceptions about creativity relates fundamentally to the development of creative potential. These constructs shape 's understanding of their environment enabling them to form a mindset, personal qualities, traits and skills that help determine attitudes towards creativity. This preliminary  explored the relationship between   and 's creative potential. Participating s responded to questionnaires assessing the level of rigidity structure in daily  rearing practices, creativity specific - interactions, and al perceptions of their 's creative self-efficacy. Their  completed the Evaluation of Creative Potential (EPoC) instrument that measures convergent and divergent thinking in graphic and verbal domains. Although, we found no statistically significant relationship between   and creative potential, several - interactions correlated significantly with al perceptions. The more s encourage novelty, the more they perceive their  to show creative behavior. Additionally, too much support for direct creativity could diminish certain creativity - related behaviors such as fantasizing.

Parenting styles and emotional intelligence of HIV-affected  in Thailand,2013,"The purpose of this  was to examine the impact of   on emotional intelligence of HIV-affected  in Thailand. This  uses data from 205 HIV-affected  in northern and northeastern Thailand. Correlation and regression analyses were used to examine the predictors of emotional intelligence. Children reporting higher levels of stress reported less caring   (standardized beta [B]=-0.18, p=0.050). Children with higher self-esteem were  more likely to perceive their s as caring (B=0.48, p=0.002). Children who scored lower on their self-esteem reported their s to be more overprotective (B=-0.30, p=0.030), and  reporting higher levels of stress reported their s to be more overprotective (B=0.12, p=0.010). Children reporting caring   were significantly more likely to report higher emotional intelligence (B=0.66, p=0.001).   play an important role in the emotional intelligence.

Participants freely acknowledged pushing or shoving (46%) and slapping or hitting peers (40%). The  contributes to the literature by focusing on upstanding (active versus passive bystander intervention) and  . Findings reveal an interesting disconnect between those who say they will intervene when confronted by friends' or peers' bullying behaviors and those who actually have intervened. Children and adolescents with authoritarian s are more likely to say they would intervene to help peers, but when asked if they actually have done so, they are the least likely to follow-through. In contrast,  with authoritative or permissive s show the opposite pattern: No significant difference in their intent to intervene, but they are more likely to become upstanders, rather than passive bystanders when actually confronted with bullying behavior."
Parenting styles and 's academic performance: Evidence from middle schools in China,2020,"Most of the existing literature has shown that s' educational background, occupation and income will affect 's initial endowment, educational investment and cultural environment. Few studies have used large samples to analyze the influence of al communication, company, supervision, requirements and other  practices on 's academic performance after controlling for s' external background. Based on a large sample survey of middle-school students in China, this  applies factor analysis and cluster analysis to categorize   as authoritative, permissive, authoritarian and neglectful. Using the instrumental variable method, we discuss the causal effect of   on 's academic performance. The findings are as follows: the   of Chinese s are predominantly authoritarian and neglectful; s of higher social classes tend to adopt the permissive  ; the authoritative   is more conducive to improving 's academic performance;   has a greater effect on  from disadvantaged backgrounds; and the   of mothers play a more vital role in their 's academic performance than do the   of fathers."

The sample was made up of 604 individuals, aged between 15 and 18. In order to gather data, the Styles & Dimensions Questionnaire: Short Version, the Father/Mother Attachment Questionnaire and the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire were used. The  suggest that the relations with s, which are characterized by inhibition of exploration and of individuality, contribute to an emotional maladjustment being positively associated with suicidal ideation (r = .26 to r = .28). This confirmed the mediating role of al attachment in the association between authoritative and permissive   from father and mother to suicidal ideation. It was  verified  a partial mediation, through the attachment to s, in the association between the 's authoritarian  and the mother's permissive  and suicidal ideation. Furthermore, it was found the presence of total mediation, by throughout to attachment to the father, in the association between the father's permissive  and suicidal ideation.

Predicting Readmission to a Child Psychiatric Inpatient Unit: The Impact of Parenting Styles,2009,"The risk of rehospitalization after a  receives psychiatric inpatient treatment is generally high. Although disorder-specific behavior contributes to the need for treatment, other environmental variables may  play a role in the need for inpatient psychiatric treatment. Therefore, we examined the influence of   (authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive) on 's risk for readmission to an inpatient psychiatric facility.

This  considers whether remembered   in hood predict multiple dimensions of functioning in adulthood. Methods. We used the 1995 National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States data set (N = 2,232) to assess the association between  behaviors remembered from hood-classified as authoritative, authoritarian, indulgent, and uninvolved-and psychological well-being, depressive symptoms, and substance abuse, in a subsample of mid- and later-life adults. Differences in outcomes by sex, race, and hood socioeconomic status were  examined across  . Results. Adults who remembered authoritative compared with authoritarian and uninvolved s reported greater psychological well-being and fewer depressive symptoms, and those with uninvolved s noted greater substance abuse. No outcome differences were found between remembered authoritative and indulgent  . A few sex and race interactions were identified: Authoritative  (compared with uninvolved) was more strongly associated with men's psychological well-being than women's, and authoritative  (compared with authoritarian) predicted reduced depressive symptoms for Whites more than non-Whites. Conclusions. There is some support that remembered   continue to be related to functioning across the lifespan. There is  evidence of resiliency, flexibility, and malleability in human development"

Parenting Styles as Perceived by Vietnamese American Adolescents,2009,"This  explored the impact of  , as perceived by Vietnamese adolescents, on their mental health. Although the aim was to compare the  between fathers and mothers, the data showed that most adolescents (83%) chose to focus on fathers in their responses when filling out the al Authority Questionnaire. Descriptive statistics showed that mothers tended to have a lower education level, lower income, and a lower acculturation score when compared to fathers. Also, the adolescents' responses were shown to reflect similar perceptions that most s, both fathers and mothers, use a punishment-oriented authoritarian  . Those adolescents who chose to focus on mothers in their responses (the mother group) tended to report a higher self-esteem and a lower depression score than those in the father group."

The Relationship Between Parenting Styles Practiced By Grandparents And Children's Emotional And Behavioral Problems,2019,"ObjectivesTo examine the relationship between grand  and grand's emotions and behaviors, while controlling for  , and to compare the effects of grand  and   on 's behavioral problems in China.MethodsA sample of 765 , with a mean age of 12.02 years (SD=0.38), participated in this cross-sectional  in Jintan city, Jiangsu province, China. All participants completed the self-report measures of emotions and behaviors, grand , and sociodemographic variables.ResultsResults showed that the well-recognized   (Care, Indifference, Overprotection, and Autonomy), when implemented by grands (grand ) and s ( ), had different patterns of effects on 's emotional and behavioral problems. Grand , especially grandal Care and Overprotection, were positively related to emotional and behavioral problems, while al Care was negatively related to 's externalizing behaviors.ConclusionsThese  highlight the importance of grand  in grand's development. Practitioners working with grands and grand need to recognize the complexity of grand-grand relationships and implement suitable interventions to meet the family needs."
Parenting Style as a Moderator of Associations Between Maternal Disciplinary Strategies and Child Well-Being,2008,"The authors investigate whether al use of punitive discipline and yielding to coercion varies in levels and associated  outcomes for mothers with different  . Participants were fourth-grade  (N = 370) and their mothers. Maternal   was determined based on levels of responsiveness and demandingness. Authoritative mothers used less punitive discipline than indifferent mothers. Authoritative and authoritarian mothers engaged in less yielding to coercion than indifferent or indulgent mothers. More punitive discipline and yielding to coercion were associated with lower academic grades and more punitive discipline was associated with more social problems, with these effects not moderated by  . Negative effects of yielding to coercion in terms of internalizing, externalizing, and social problems were observed only within authoritarian families. Greater use of punitive discipline was associated with more externalizing problems within the indulgent and authoritarian   groups and more internalizing problems within the authoritarian group."
"Mothers' and fathers' parenting styles and associations with toddlers' externalizing, internalizing, and adaptive behaviors",2012,"The two primary objectives of the   were to (a) investigate mothers' and fathers' reports of their own as well as their partner's  , and (b) assess how mothers' and fathers'   uniquely and jointly predicted toddlers' externalizing, internalizing, and adaptive behaviors. Fifty-nine mothers and fathers independently completed the  Styles and Dimension Questionnaire (PDSQ; Robinson, Mandleco, Olsen, & Hart, 2001) and the Behavior Assessment Scale for Children-2 (BASC-2; Reynolds & Kamphaus, 2004). s' self-reports of their   were positively correlated with each other for all three   (authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive). Comparisons between s' reports of their partner's  with that of the partner's self-reports were positively and moderately correlated for all three  . Findings revealed mothers' and fathers' self-reported   explained 44% of the variance in youngsters' externalizing behaviors. In particular, permissive  by mothers and authoritarian  by fathers uniquely and significantly predicted toddlers' externalizing behaviors, while authoritative paternal  was predictive of adaptive behaviors.

Effects of perceived parenting styles and mental health on drinking behaviors,2020,"This  focused on the effects of  , as perceived by the college student, on drinking behaviors. A total of 36 students between the ages of 18 and 34 were recruited from a small liberal-arts college. Four surveys were counterbalanced and administered: 1) Perceived  Styles, 2) Drinking Behaviors, 3) Mental Health, and 4) Multiple Affect Adjective Check List (MAACL). Findings showed that problem drinking was strongly correlated with mental health concerns, such as depression, anxiety, hostility, and confusion. al trust and support were shown to be correlated to mental health, and there was a significant association between problem drinking and al trust and rules. These findings suggest that perceived   impact later socioemotional functioning and drinking behaviors. Therefore, future  is warranted on the topic, particularly as it relates to how individuals perceive  , the degree of subsequent risk-taking behaviors, and how these may differ on larger campuses. Targeting s with education and early intervention should be explored while  accounting for implications, such as early environmental stressors, whether or not mental health concerns are predecessors or sequelae of perceived  , and how the order of events may impact subsequent drinking behaviors."
Parenting styles and preschool 's behaviour in a Saudi Arabian postgraduate dental setting,2021,"Background The   is shifting universally. Children lack the skills needed to deal with life stressful situations like those  in dental setting. Previous studies showed a correlation between   and the 's dental behaviour. No studies have been performed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) to relate   to 's dental behaviour. The purpose of this  is to correlate   with the dental behaviour of their , in Riyadh, KSA. Methodology Two hundred and eighty-two healthy preschool  aged 3-6 years were recruited in their first dental visit, to a postgraduate Paediatric Dentistry Clinics of the Dental University Hospital at KSU, Riyadh, KSA. The  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire was completed by the primary caregiver/s. The behaviour of the  was evaluated after dental prophylaxis and fluoride application in the dental chair using Frankl behavior rating scale. Family and  demographic data were evaluated through a questionnaire. Results Two hundred and eighty-two healthy Saudi  participated in the  with their s. Two   were identified among Saudi s including authoritative (94%, n = 265) and permissive   (6%, n = 17). Most of the  behaved positively (n = 205, 72.7%). Significant correlations were detected between   and 's dental anxiety (P value 0.02) but not significantly correlated to a 's dental behaviuor. Conclusion In the KSU sample studied, two   were identified among Saudi s, authoritative and permissive  .   was correlated to al dental anxiety and had an influence on a 's dental behaviour.

Certain  and certain educational practices enhance the personality characteristics of the  at different levels. Personality dimensions were examined using the Big Five model, specifically the NEO FFI questionnaire. The   were examined using a DZSVR questionnaire which identifies four basic educational : autocratic, liberal, integrative and indifferent, based on level of component of requirements and freedom. On a sample of 402 adolescents, we found that there is a strong correlation between   and adolescents personality dimensions, and we found differences in personality dimension between  groups ( ). An integrative and liberal   support the personality dimensions as the consciousness, extraversion and openness, while autocratic and indifferent   support the neuroticism."
"Parenting style, social interaction anxiety, and problematic internet use among students",,"Our  examined the roles of   and social interaction anxiety in problematic internet use (PIU) in a sample of Nigerian undergraduate students (n = 300; female = 63.3%; mean age = 19.66 years, SD = 2.64 years). The students completed the  Style Inventory II (PS-II), the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale, and the Generalised Problematic Internet Use Scale 2. Following regression analysis,  showed authoritative  to predict lower PIU among the students, while permissive  predicted higher PIU among the students. Social interaction anxiety predicted higher PIU and mediated the relationship between the   and PIU, decreasing PIU among female students but not for the male students. Gendered   influences PIU through social anxiety. These findings suggest a need for gender sensitive PIU interventions in Nigerian patriarchal culture."
Parenting styles and types: Breastfeeding attitudes in a large sample of mothers,2021,"Objective: The importance of breastfeeding for both maternal and infant health is well established. However, it remains the case that only a small percentage of infants are breastfed after the first six months of life. Maternal negative breastfeeding attitudes are associated with a reduced likelihood of breastfeeding an infant, but they are a malleable target for practitioner interventions. By adjusting perceptions, and therefore behaviours within the population, maternal and infant health outcomes may be improved. As such, it is important to understand whether certain types of mother might feel more negatively about breastfeeding. Here. we investigated the relationships between  , personality traits, and breastfeeding attitudes. In addition, we aimed to address the interrelated nature of   by identifying 'types' of mother who may feel more negatively about breastfeeding. Design: A cross-sectional survey was used in order to measure  , personality traits, and attitudes to breastfeeding. Participants: A sample of 1,347 mothers (age M = 31.4 years, SD = 7.4 years) participated. Recruitment took place through online mother and baby groups based predominantly in the United Kingdom. Results: More permissive and less uninvolved mothers felt positively about breastfeeding, but limited associations between personality factors and breastfeeding attitudes were found. We applied a cluster analytical approach to investigate whether there were particular 'types' of mothers in our sample, and if these showed systematic differences. Our analyses revealed two profiles, best described as 'high nurturance' (high scoring on authoritative and permissive) and 'low nurturance' (low scoring on these dimensions). These two types of mother showed significant differences along all four  , and our 'high nurturance' type was more conscientious and emotionally stable, and felt more positively about breastfeeding. Conclusions:   were associated with breastfeeding attitudes. Through identifying an underlying nurturance dimension that best explains differences in   across mothers, we provide a potential avenue to improving breastfeeding attitudes. By focussing on 'low nurturance' mothers in particular, professionals may be able to provide interventions to improve breastfeeding attitudes and, as a , address low rates of breastfeeding in the UK."
Parenting styles and Internet use,2017,"The Internet has become the most popular way for young people to communicate with one another. Recent data indicate that 95% of students have Internet access. This  examined the links between Internet use and the   that shape - interactions. Empirical analysis showed that Internet use accounts for the majority of adolescents' leisure time. The neglecting   has the strongest relationship with addictive Internet use by adolescent girls and boys.

Child self-esteem and different parenting styles of mothers: a cross-sectional study,2017,"Aims: Several factors affect the formation of self-esteem in , but given the importance of alattitudes and educational practices in the development of a sense of self-worth in , the   was designed to investigate the relationship between   and self-esteem in . Materials and Methods: Thepopulation of this cross-sectional, descriptive  included primary school  of Zahedan cityduring 2013-2014. The data collection tools used were Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory and Diana Baumrind  Style Inventory. Indicators such as the mean, standard deviation and frequency were used to describe data, and a multivariate regression test, Pearson correlation coefficient and SPSS software version 16 were applied in data analysis. Results: The total self-esteem score of the  participating in this  was 5.6 +/- 32.5 and most mothers had an authoritative  (80.6%). There was significant relationship between self-esteem and authoritative   (p = 0.05). Conclusion: The indicated that authoritative   was a significant predictor of 's self-esteem, which suggests that  of s with authoritative   have significantly higher self-esteem."
Parenting style and adolescent's reaction to conflict: Is there a relationship?,2002,"Purpose: To determine if the reactions of adolescents toward hypothetical situations that can lead to conflict and violence varied by   of their mothers. Methods: This  was part of a larger  project involving adolescents and their mothers participating in a longitudinal HIV-prevention program. Mothers and their adolescents were recruited from a community-based organization (CBO) and interviewed separately. Data were analyzed using the responses of 439 African-American adolescents ranging from ages 11 to 14 years. The responses of adolescents to questions about  were used to classify mothers into one of three  : authoritative, authoritarian, or permissive. The anticipated reactions to hypothetical situations scale consists of 11 items with 6 response categories. The six responses were reclassified into three categories ranging from not at all violent to extremely violent. Higher scores indicate more violent reactions to the hypothetical situations. The  scale consists of two subscales: a 13-item al involvement scale and a 13-item al control scale. Items were rated on a 5-point Likert scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Analysis of variance was used to determine if the anticipated reactions of adolescents toward hypothetical situations varied by   of their mothers. Results: Adolescent participants who reported a more permissive   expressed more intense negative reactions toward the hypothetical situations that can provoke conflict. Male adolescents  expressed more intense reactions than females to the situations. There was no difference in intensity of reaction by age after controlling for gender and  . Conclusions:   is associated with adolescents' reactions to hypothetical situations that can provoke conflict. This finding highlights the importance of considering s and their approach to -rearing as a factor in the adolescent's ability to react to conflict. (C) Society for Adolescent Medicine, 2002."
Perceived Parenting Styles Fail to Mediate Between Anxiety and Attachment Styles in Adult Siblings of Individuals with Developmental Disabilities,2016,"Adult siblings of individuals with developmental disabilities often experience higher levels of anxiety than individuals in the general population. The   tested whether perceived  could mediate the relationship between attachment  and anxiety in the sibling group compared to a control group. Little association was found between perceived  and attachment  or anxiety for the siblings but there were robust and expected findings for the control. Adult attachment-related-anxiety was a significant unique predictor of anxiety in the sibling group but there was no mediational role for perceived . Conversely, the majority of   significantly mediated the relationship between attachment and anxiety in the control. Implications for the atypical findings in the sibling group are discussed."
The Relationship Between Parental Psychopathic Traits and Parenting Style,2018,"Surprisingly little  has examined the role of al psychopathic traits in the - relationship. We aimed to gain a better understanding of how al psychopathic traits are related to   and to determine whether specific al psychopathic traits are differentially related to  behaviors. A sample of male and female s from a community population completed the Psychopathic Personality Inventory-Revised (PPI-R) as well as a modified version of the al Authority Questionnaire (PAQ). Path analyses predicting PAQ subscales from PPI-R factors indicated poor model fit. However, path analyses examining PAQ and PPI-R subscales indicated good model fit, with PPI-R subscales explaining 20-25% of variance in PAQ subscale scores. Surprisingly, PAQ Authoritative  was significantly predicted by the greatest number of PPI-R facets, including Carefree Nonplanfulness, Coldheartedness, Rebellious Nonconformity (all positive) and Fearlessness (negative). Rebellious Nonconformity  positively predicted PAQ Permissive , and negatively predicted PAQ Authoritative . Results suggest al psychopathic traits may be associated with specific  , although future  should consider potential moderating variables."
Maternal depression and socio-economic status moderate the parenting style/ obesity association,2010,"Objective: The purpose of the  was to test the moderating influence of two risk factors, maternal depression and socio-economic status (SES), on the association between authoritarian and permissive   and  obesity. Design: Correlational, cross-sectional .   was measured with the  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ). Maternal depression was measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD). BMI-for-age percentile was used to categorize  by weight status ( with BMI-for-age >= 95th percentile were classified as obese). SES was computed from  education and occupational status using the four-factor Hollingshead index. Setting: Rural public schools in a mid-western state in the USA. Subjects: One hundred and seventy-six mothers of first-grade  (ninety-one boys, eighty-five girls) enrolled in rural public schools. Results: Both maternal depression and SES were found to moderate the permissive  / obesity association, but not the authoritarian/ obesity association. For depressed mothers, but not for non-depressed mothers, more permissive  was predictive of  obesity. Similarly more permissive  was predictive of  obesity among higher SES mothers, but not for lower SES mothers. Conclusions: Maternal depression and SES interact with permissive   to predict  obesity. Future  should examine the relationship among these variables using a longitudinal design."
Parenting Styles and Children's Delinquency Reconsidered: An Empirical Assessment,2020,"For decades, criminological theories have emphasized the importance of strong - relationships in preventing 's delinquent behaviors (e.g., Gottfredson & Hirschi, 1990). In particular, Thornberry's (1996) interactional theory has catalyzed studies of the critical importance of reciprocal relationships between s and . However, though previous studies have examined reciprocal relationships, they typically do not assess changes in those relationships over time (Wiloughby & Hamza, 2011). The purpose of this  is to evaluate how reciprocal relationships vary among   and how this variance accounts for 's delinquency. In particular, using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 Cohort , the   examines how the authoritative   and different 's and 's sexes affect the reciprocal - relationship. It discovers a significant correlation between authoritative   and a reduction in  delinquency and observes how a 's sex influences this dynamic."
"Parenting Style, Perfectionism, and Creativity in High-Ability and High-Achieving Young Adults",2012,"The current  explores the potential relationships among perceived  , perfectionism, and creativity in a high-ability and high-achieving young adult population. Using data from 323 honors college students at a Midwestern university, bivariate correlations suggested positive relationships between (a) permissive   and creativity and (b) authoritarian   and socially prescribed perfectionism. Furthermore, negative relationships were  found between authoritarian   and creativity. These relationships were further investigated using a path model that included control variables for gender and  education level. Findings suggest statistically significant relationships between creativity and gender, authoritarian  and socially prescribed perfectionism, authoritarian  and creativity, and permissive  and creativity."
Is There a Relation between Mothers' Parenting Styles and Children's Trait Emotional Intelligence?,2012,"Introduction. Emotional intelligence has been proposed as a human faculty that may have a strong impact on a variety of 's developmental outcomes such as: school achievement, peer acceptance, and behavioral adjustment. It has  been proposed that  may influence 's development of emotional intelligence. However, very little  has been done in this area. Method. This  investigates the relation between  and emotional intelligence. It was developed in two phases. Phase 1 examined mother's positive and negative  and the relation with their 's trait emotional intelligence. Phase 2 investigated authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and uninvolved  . Data was collected for both mothers and  using self-report questionnaires. Results. In phase 1, no correlations were obtained between the trait emotional intelligence measures and the two al variables: positive , and negative . In phase 2, ANOVA analysis showed no significant differences in the trait emotional intelligence of the  among the four  . Discussion and Conclusion. Results suggest that 's trait emotional intelligence may be more susceptible to specific emotion-related  efforts than to their mothers'  ."
The Role of Parenting Styles on Behavior Problem Profiles of Adolescents,2019,"al behavior is one of the most influential factors on the development of adolescent externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. These behavioral problems are closely related and often co-occur. The objectives of this work were: (i) to identify adolescents profiles according to their behavior problems; (ii) to explore individual, family, and social characteristics associated with these profiles; and (iii) to analyze the potential role of   in belonging to adolescents' profiles. A total of 449 Spanish adolescents (223 from families declared at-risk and enrolled in Child Welfare Services and 226 from families from the general population) participated in this . The analyses revealed three profiles of adolescents based on external and internal behavior problems (adjusted, external maladjustment, and internal maladjustment).   explained the adolescents' belonging to different profiles, in which the indulgent  was the most favorable in general terms. The distinctive role of   on two types of maladjustment profiles was confirmed. The relationship between   and adolescent adjustment is a key component that should be included in interventions according to adolescents' behavior problem profiles. Furthermore, the  shed light on the need that family interventions are complemented with individualized interventions with adolescents that accumulate stressful life events."
Does optimal parenting style help offspring maintain healthy weight into mid-life?,2019,"An authoritative   is generally associated with healthier body weight in  and adolescents. However, whether the protective effect of an authoritative  on offspring body weight may persist into adulthood has seldom been investigated. In this  we examined the longitudinal association between   and body mass index (BMI) change in mid-life. Longitudinal data from the Midlife in the United States Study (N = 3929) were analyzed using generalized estimating equations, adjusting for a range of relevant covariates.   were assessed at phase I (1995-1996) using items measuring al warmth and control, while BMI was assessed at phases I and II (2004-2006). Four   were derived following prior : authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and uninvolved . Compared to an authoritative , an authoritarian  was associated with 14% higher increase in the standardized BMI change score (beta = 0.14, 95% confidence interval: 0.03, 0.26). While there was suggestive evidence that an uninvolved versus authoritative  might  be associated with greater BMI increase, we found no differences between a permissive and authoritative . This  suggested that the protective effect of an authoritative   on offspring body weight may persist well into mid-life, particularly as compared to the authoritarian  and possibly the uninvolved . Such work may reinforce the importance of a public health focus on improving  practices and suggest the value of implementing  programs, as one strategy for increasing the likelihood that individuals can maintain healthy weight well into adulthood."
TREATMENT ADHERENCE DIFFICULTIES AMONG CHILDREN WITH CANCER - THE ROLE OF PARENTING STYLE,1993,"Investigated the prevalence of treatment adherence problems.among  undergoing cancer treatment and explored the relationship of sociodemographic factors,  functional status, and   to these difficulties. Nurse ratings of adherence difficulties encountered during the cancer treatment regimen were completed on 77  and their caregivers. A subset of caregivers  completed a measure of  attitudes and practices. Results indicated that certain adherence difficulties were related to the 's age and functional status, the family's socioeconomic status (SES), and  . The 's age was related to adherence to procedure-related tasks; younger  had more frequent problems with completing these tasks. More functional  had a greater number of adherence problems. Families with a lower SES had more difficulties with timeliness and cancellations/delays of clinic appointments and promptness of reporting of the 's reactions to treatment. Children of caregivers who had a more ''supportive''   (were more sensitive to 's input, had a less restrictive attitude towards , and were more nurturant) canceled and delayed fewer appointments, were on time more frequently for appointments, and reported reactions to treatment with less delay. Implications of these findings for future  on treatment adherence and for clinical interventions are discussed."
Socialization of Dissonance Processes: Reports of Parenting Style Experienced During Childhood Moderate Dissonance Reactions,2014,"Based on portrayals of dissonance as a learned drive state, it was hypothesized that there may be a role for   and related variables in the development of dissonance reactions. This experiment found that both reports of having s with authoritarian   and learning the link between responsibility and consequences moderated the effect of an induced compliance dissonance manipulation on attitudes. Reports of having experienced authoritarian  and responsibility emphasis both bolstered the effect of the dissonance manipulation, accentuating the difference between the dissonance and control conditions as authoritarian  and responsibility increased. These findings help shed some light on the processes by which dissonance reactions might be learned."

This  s the  of the preliminary validation (factorial and convergent validity and reliability) of the Portuguese version of the  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire for the Angolan context. The  comprised 258 Angolan mothers and fathers of school-aged  (6-12 years). The original three-factor structure (32 items authoritative, authoritarian and permissive ) was replicated through confirmatory factor analysis, although only the first two revealed good reliability (.83 and .76, respectively). The  suggest that the modified Portuguese version of the PSDQ is suitable for the Angolan context, namely for  purposes. Its use for clinical purposes requires further psychometric studies."
"Maternal Parenting Styles, School Involvement, and Children's School Achievement and Conduct in Singapore",2014,"This  examined the roles of 's perceptions of maternal   (warmth, psychological control, and behavioral control) and maternal involvement in school-focused  practices (home-based involvement, home-school conferencing, and school-based involvement) predicting 's school achievement and conduct in Singapore. Students (N = 712) in 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th grades completed questionnaires on their mothers'   and school-focused  practices. Student achievement and conduct were assessed using achievement tests and conduct grades. Achievement was predicted by   (warmth, behavioral control, and psychological control) after adjusting for gender, grade, ethnicity, and maternal education. School-focused  practices predicted achievement and conduct after adjusting for  .   moderated the relationships among  practices and achievement and conduct. Maternal warmth increased the relationship between maternal school-based involvement and 's achievement. In addition, behavioral control increased the relationship between home-based involvement and appropriate school conduct. Gender and grade  moderated the relationships among   and school involvement and achievement. The relationship between warmth and achievement was stronger for girls than boys, whereas there was a stronger relationship between home-based school involvement and achievement for boys than for girls. Warmth predicted achievement in 3rd grade but not in the older grades. Overall, the findings provide support for the hypothesis that school-focused  practices predict achievement and conduct after adjusting for   and for the hypothesis that   moderate  practices."

Mothers completed self-report measures on 's emotionality, emotion regulation, and  .ResultsThe comparison between the two groups showed that obese , compared with their non-obese counterpart, had higher levels of negative emotionality and emotional lability and a lower level of emotion regulation; they  had more authoritarian and permissive mothers than non-obese counterpart. Logistic regressions showed a joint contribution of the authoritarian   and emotional lability to obesity, so that both at lower and higher levels of emotion lability, 's obesity tended to be lower when authoritarian  was low and to be higher when authoritarian  was high.ConclusionsUnderstanding the mechanisms through which   and characteristics of  are associated to obesity risk may lead to the development of more-comprehensive and better-targeted interventions."
"Parenting style, resilience, and mental health of community-dwelling elderly adults in China",2016,"Background: Given the increasing elderly population worldwide, the identification of potential determinants of successful ageing is important. Many studies have shown that   and mental resilience may influence mental health; however, little is known about the psychological mechanisms that underpin this relationship. The current  sought to explore the relationships among mental resilience, perceptions of s'  , and depression and anxiety among community-dwelling elderly adults in China. Methods: In total, 439 community-dwelling elderly Chinese adults aged 60-91 years completed the Personal and s'  Style Scale, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, and Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale. Results: Elderly adults whose s preferred positive and authoritative   had higher levels of mental resilience and lower levels of depression and anxiety. Elderly adults ed in the authoritarian  were found to have higher levels of depression and anxiety, with lower mental resilience. Conclusions: The findings of this  provide evidence related to successful ageing and coping with life pressures, and highlight the important effects of  on mental health. The  suggest that examination of the proximal determinants of successful ageing is not sufficient-distal factors may  contribute to the 'success' of ageing by modifying key psychological dispositions that promote adaptation to adversity."

The   examined the influence of maternal and paternal   and behavior problems on the academic outcomes of primary-school . Measures used in this  included the Inventory of  Guide, the Child Behavior Checklist and information on academic outcomes (n = 78 families). The range age of the students was 6 to 13 years old (mean = 8.08; SD = 1.6; 38 girls). The participation rate was 90.7%. The  showed that behavior problems and sensitive   were related to academic outcomes. Specifically, attentional problems and maternal sensitive   appeared to be significant predictors of academic outcomes in this . These data suggest the relevance of attention and maternal sensitive   in understanding processes that promote academic outcomes."

Dog-Directed Parenting Styles Mirror Dog Owners' Orientations Toward Animals,2020,"s raise  in consistent ways, and these   affect  wellbeing and societal adjustment. Recently, we identified such   in the owner-dog relationship. Dog owners of the authoritarian- correction orientated (AUC) type stand out for demandingness. Authoritative dog owners adopt either an intrinsic-value orientated  (AUI), of high responsiveness and attention to a dog's needs, or an authoritative-training orientated  (AUT) of high demandingness and responsiveness in teaching a dog how to behave socially. The causes for dog owners to favor certain dog- directed   are ly unknown. Orientations toward animals could play a role, and these have previously been determined in dog owners, capsulizing views on dog ownership. A dominionistic orientation values the dog for its utility, a humanistic orientation humanizes dogs, and a protectionistic orientation acknowledges the dog's species-specific interests. We wanted to know how these views on dog ownership are associated with dog-directed  . Therefore, orientations toward animals and dog-directed   were determined from dog-owner reports collected online (n = 518). The Likert-scale items regarding the orientations toward animals were grouped using data reduction techniques. The scores for our newly formed orientations were then rank correlated to the dog-directed  , with all scores expressed as percentages of the theoretical maximum. A dominionistic orientation was associated with AUC, indicating that combined demandingness and non-responsiveness in dog-directed  partly  from the owner's perceived need to dominate the dog. A humanistic/protectionistic orientation was associated with AUI, suggesting that the combination of  responsiveness and relatively low demandingness is an outcome of humanizing dogs. These findings support the idea that orientations toward animals partly underlie dog-directed   and may constitute a starting point for guiding owners away from less favorable dog-directed  ."
Maternal and paternal parenting styles: assessment and relationship with adolescent adjustment,2007,"This  s the validation of a scale that was elaborated to assess maternal and paternal   according to the perception of their adolescent . The scale was applied to a sample composed by 848 adolescents aged from 12 to 17 years old, that  filled out the Youth Self Report, a life satisfaction scale and a substance use questionnaire. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses revealed a six factors structure for maternal and  for paternal  . These dimensions showed significant relationships with most of the measures of adolescent adjustment considered in the Study.

Maternal and paternal parenting styles: Unique and combined links to adolescent and early adult delinquency,2011,"The   examines the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between fathers' and mothers'   and male and female delinquency using a sample of 330 Dutch families with a mid or late adolescent son or daughter (ages 14-22), followed across two measurement waves with a 5-year interval.   of fathers and mothers were linked to delinquency. A significant   by sex interaction was found: neglectful  was related to higher levels of delinquency in males and permissive  was linked to delinquency in females. A long term relationship was found between fathers' neglectful   and delinquency in males. Furthermore,  revealed that levels of delinquency were the lowest in families with at least one authoritative  and highest in families with two neglectful s, indicating that the level of delinquency was dependent on the combination of mother's and father's  .

Impulsivity mediates the association between parenting styles and self-harm in Chinese adolescents,2021,"Background  are significantly associated with self-harm (SH) in adolescents. Nevertheless, little is known about the mechanism underlying this association. This  primarily aimed to evaluate the potential mediating role of impulsivity in the association between   and SH in Chinese adolescents.MethodsSelf-administered questionnaires were used to conduct a survey among a sample population consisting of 3146 adolescents in southwest China. Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between  , impulsivity, and SH. A path model investigation further examined the mediating role of impulsivity in terms of the association between   and SH.ResultsThe age range of participants was 10 to 17years old. The prevalence of SH was 47.0% (95% CI: 36.3-58.0%). Impulsivity, less paternal emotional warmth, maternal over-protection, and rejection were significantly associated with SH. The path model identified impulsivity as a salient mediator, accounting for 23.4% of the total association between   and SH. The hypothesized path model indicated differences in the   of fathers and mothers: Impulsivity played a significant mediating role, though only in respect to the maternal over-protection and rejection paths.ConclusionsFor Chinese  and adolescents who experience a harsher maternal  , impulsivity-centered intervention measures might be effective in reducing SH related to  ."
Who overuses Smartphones? Roles of virtues and parenting style in Smartphone addiction among Chinese college students,2016,"Several empirical studies have linked negative   (i.e., al rejection and overprotection) with a higher degree of Smartphone addiction. However, few studies have analyzed the potential protective factors (e.g., virtues) that may prevent addiction and promote effective Smartphone addiction interventions. Therefore, we examined if virtues (i.e., relationship, vitality, and conscientiousness) mediated the association between   and Smartphone addiction among college students. Moreover, we examined whether these relationships were moderated by gender. Chinese college students (N = 742) ages 16-25 years completed the: 1) short-Egna Minnen av Barndoms Uppfostran-Chinese measure of  , 2) 96-item Chinese Virtues Questionnaire, and the 3) Mobile Phone Addiction Index of Smartphone addiction. The  showed that negative   significantly influenced college students' Smartphone addiction. Furthermore, virtues acted as a cognitive mechanism that mediated the association between negative   and Smartphone addiction. Moreover, male virtues may be more sensitive to negative   than female virtues. Relevant suggestions for college administrators, educators, s, and future ers are offered. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Personality and Parenting Style as Predictors of Life Satisfaction Among Chinese Secondary Students,2016,"Student life satisfaction plays a key role in academic achievement; however, the exploration on the predictors of life satisfaction in secondary school students is insufficient. This  explored how indigenous personality traits and   predicted students' life satisfaction. The participants were 718 junior secondary students in China with a mean age of 13.39 years. Personality, al , and life satisfaction were assessed through inventories which were statistically supported in the literature. The  showed that personality,  , and life satisfaction were interrelated. Personality and   altogether accounted for around 31 % variance in student global life satisfaction.

Different domains of life satisfaction were predicted by personality factors and   to different extents. Implications for crosscultural theorizing and positive education are discussed."
Perception of parenting styles and academic achievement: The mediating role of goal orientations,2016,"This  examined the relation between of the adolescents' perception of   with their goal orientations and academic achievement. The mediational role of goal orientations in the associations between   and achievement was  investigated. The sample included 174 high school students (59.8% girls) aged between 14 and 18. The adolescents completed measures regarding their perception of   and goal orientations. The findings showed that   were significantly associated with adolescents' goal orientations and academic achievement. Further, the goal orientations mediated the relations between perception of   and achievement. Specifically, the al rejection was associated with achievement due to its association with mastery goals, while the al autonomy was associated with academic achievement due to its association with mastery-avoidance goals. The findings highlight the importance that , in interrelation with goal orientations, plays in the high school adolescents' achievement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Parenting styles and practices among Chinese immigrant mothers with young ,2012,"This  investigated how Chinese immigrant mothers in the USA make meaning of their   and practices in rearing their young  (aged two to six). Twelve Chinese immigrant mothers were interviewed. A key finding reveals that the Chinese immigrant mothers'  practices reflected the indigenous concept of jiaoyang in the Chinese culture (with jiao meaning educating, teaching and training; yang meaning rearing; and jiaoyang implying educating and rearing). Another finding is that except for one mother, the rest practised authoritative , combining high levels of both al warmth and al control. The Chinese immigrant mothers'  seemed to best reflect what Kagitcibasi described as the psychological interdependence interaction pattern of the family model with the rearing orientation focusing on al control, emotional closeness and  autonomy, leading to the  becoming both emotionally autonomous and related. Implications for future  and professional practice are discussed."

Children growing up in a family context where they feel supported and protected are less vulnerable in the presence of psychopathology. The aim of this  is analysing the impact of   and the anxious-depressive symptoms on  adaptation. Design and Setting A total of 367  between the ages of 10 and 12, following a similar distribution by sex. The  completed self-reports assessing  ,  adaptation, and depressive-anxiety symptomatology. Methods The data were analysed using two complementary methodologies: linear regressions and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Results Both methodologies indicated that the main predictors explaining  adaptation were depression and an authoritative  . The fsQCA models explained a greater amount of variance and included more variables in their prediction than the regression models. Conclusion Identifying family and emotional aspects when working with  may help professionals to improve hood adaptation. Consequently, well-adapted  are less likely to suffer the negative consequences of emotional symptoms in later evolutionary stages."

Problematic Internet Use in Israeli-Arab Adolescent Males: Do Parenting Styles Matter?,2019,"The current  explored the relationships between   and problematic internet use (PIU) in male adolescents from Israeli-Arab families. In the  literature, little is known about the role played by  in relation to 's PIU in Arab societies. One hundred and eighty male adolescents whose age ranges from 12 to 16 (M = 13.92, SD = 1.42) reported their internet behavior and their s' . Controlling for the participants' age, family size, and grades,   explained 24% of the variance in PIU scores, with authoritarian  being the only significant unique predictor. Afurther analysis of covariance revealed that adolescents who perceived their s as authoritative scored lower than their counterparts in PIU. Our findings suggest that while Israeli-Arab male adolescents might benefit from authoritative  at home, it is the al authoritarian practices and behaviors per se that should be targeted as part of PIU intervention and prevention efforts."

Authoritative parenting style and adolescent smoking and drinking,2012,"While peer influences have often found to be a risk factor in terms of adolescent: substance use, al variables may continue to serve as an adaptive and protective function, although the role of s is more latent and controversial. Therefore, the main goal of this paper was to investigate the role of authoritative   and other family variables in adolescents' smoking and drinking. Using a sample of Hungarian youth (N = 2072; age range between 12 and 22; Mean = 15.4 years, S.D. = 1.8 years: 49.2% males) logistic regression analyses confirmed that authoritative   (particularly responsiveness) and positive identification with s may serve as a protection, whereas negative family interactions may act as a risk factor. These relationships are particularly decisive in case of monthly prevalence of drinking and both lifetime and current prevalence of smoking. Gender differences are slight (namely, al control for boys, whereas responsiveness for girls seem to be more relevant), however, the role of certain al variables may change with age. Although al control tends to decrease among high school students, it even serves as a greater protection for those whose s continue providing al monitoring. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The attitudes toward  and the coping  of 188 Flemish non-kinship foster s were examined using a Dutch version of the Adult-Adolescent  Inventory (AAPI-2) and a Dutch version of the short form of the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS-SF). Flemish foster s had average scores on the four subscales or were at medium risk for negative . Only for the two subscales inappropriate expectations and: role reversal half of the foster s had positive attitudes toward . A total foster s ranging from 0.5% to 8% were at high risk for negative . No foster and family characteristics were associated with attitudes toward . Foster s use all of the four different coping  (task-oriented, emotion and avoidant (treat oneself and find a friend) coping). The preferable coping  is for half of the foster s taskoriented coping. An emotional coping  could be predicted:by age and total years as foster s.

Parenting styles and trait emotional intelligence in adolescence,2016,"The existence of individual differences in trait emotional intelligence (trait EI) makes the investigation of factors that contribute to such variations critical. Given the paucity of  in this area, the purpose of this  was the examination of the relationship between   and trait EI in an adolescent population. The sample of our  consisted of 127 adolescents (M age = 16.4, SD = 0.96; 42.2% female) from Greek schools, 15-19 years old, who were asked to complete questionnaires of perceived  (al Authority Questionnaire - PAQ) and trait EI (Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Adolescent Short Form - TEIQue-ASF). The estimation of the association between  scores and trait EI was based on a multivariable mixed-effects regression model. An association between   and trait EI, statistically significant for authoritativeness (b = 0.27, z = 3.92, p < 0.001) and marginally significant for authoritarianism (b = -0.10, z = -1.77, p = 0.08), emerged even after controlling for a set of potential predictors of trait EI. Additionally, statistically significant associations of adolescents' gender (b = -0.29, z = -2.37, p = 0.02) and al education (b = 0.32, z = 2.54, p = 0.01) with trait EI were found. These findings provide insight in the field of trait EI antecedents and underline the potential significance of primary prevention programs with s that aim to develop trait EI at a young age."

Methods: Healthy four- to six-year-olds (n equals 288), with carious primary molars scheduled to receive amalgam fillings were selected. The Primary Caregivers Practices Report was used to assess the  , and the Children's Behavior Questionnaire Very Short Form was used to evaluate  temperament. Children were managed using common behavior management strategies. Child behavior and anxiety during the procedure were assessed using the Frankl behavior rating scale and the verbal skill scale, respectively. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to examine the correlation among variables. Results: Authoritative   was positively related to positive 's behavior (P<.05) and negatively related to 's anxiety (P<05). A positive relationship existed between permissive subscale and negative behaviors (P<.05) and 's anxiety (P<05).

Fostering creative thinking in the family: The importance of parenting styles,2021,"Family plays an important role in students' creative thinking development. However, the effect of   on creative thinking remains unclear. Using a sample of 2,143 students from a high school in northern China (58.47% girls; Mage = 16.45), the  examined the relationship between   and creative thinking. We find that the dimension of al emotional warmth is positively related to students' creative thinking, while al rejection and overprotection are negatively associated with creative thinking. Father's emotional warmth has a larger positive effect on creative thinking than mother's, while maternal rejection and overprotection have a greater negative effect on creative thinking than father's. We provide some suggestive evidence that students' internal locus of control and self-esteem mediate the relationship between   and creative thinking. The  of heterogeneity analysis show that   play a greater role in the creative thinking of girls, lower grade students, and those with disadvantaged family background. In a sense,  interventions that target creative thinking among underprivileged students will yield higher returns. This  unraveled the effect of   on students' creative thinking, explored the mechanisms of the development of this relationship, and examined the heterogeneous effects of different groups.

Parenting Style of Women Who Conceived Using In Vitro Fertilization: A Meta-Analysis,2014,"Background: Research has shown that the mental health of women contributes to their  . However, it remains unclear whether the experience of in vitro fertilization (IVF) affects  . Purpose: This  was designed to assess whether there is a difference in   between women who conceived using IVF and those who conceived naturally. Methods: This meta-analysis searched three electronic databases (MEDLINE, PsychInfo, and CINAHL) for relevant articles published between 1978 and 2011. Key words used included , mothering, - relations, rearing, infertility, assisted reproductive technique, IVF, and intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Study inclusion criteria were as follows: published in an English-language peer-reviewed journal, with the definition of   categorized as one of two dimensions: warmth and control; quantification of the  behaviors; use of a case-controlled  design to compare IVF and natural conceptions; and reported data sufficient to calculate the effect sizes. Studies that included women who conceived using a donor egg or sperm for IVF and those that included women who were either surrogates or in homosexual relationships were excluded. Three hundred ninety studies were identified. Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to appraise the quality of the data. Results: The IVF participants used significantly greater controlling  behaviors than their natural conception participant peers (d = 0.148, p < .01). There was no difference between the two groups in terms of  behaviors related to warmth, rejection, or respect for autonomy. The homogeneity test for the effect size of warmth and controlling  behavior achieved significance. Conclusions/Implications for Practice: Women who conceive using IVF have slightly but still significantly greater controlling  behaviors than women who conceive naturally. The  of this  may help professionals to better understand the   of IVF women and develop appropriate interventions to reduce  anxiety and promote the mental health of IVF women."
The Mediating Role of the Interpersonal Schemas Between Parenting Styles and Psychological Symptoms: A Schema Focused View,2009,"Objective: The first aim of this  was to examine the relationships between perceived   and interpersonal schemas.

The rationale was that prenatal autonomous (sense of volition and self-fulfillment) and controlled (feeling pressured) bearing motivations would shape later al  (autonomy-supportive vs. controlling, respectively) and, consequently,  adjustment. Over a period of 2 years beginning at pregnancy, 326 Israeli mothers reported their prenatal bearing motivations, as well as al  and  behavior problems 20 months postpartum. Results of a path analysis revealed that prenatal autonomous bearing motivation predicted autonomy-supportive , yet the latter was not associated with 's behavior problems. Prenatal controlled motivation predicted controlling , which, in turn, predicted 's internalizing and externalizing problems. No direct effects of bearing motivation on 's behavior problems are observed, suggesting that bearing motivation is a distal antecedent operating through more proximal factors such as  . Findings were robust to 's temperamental tendencies and sociodemographic risk factors such as maternal age, high-risk pregnancy, and preterm birth. These findings have theoretical and practical implications for the discourse on motivations underlying the bearing decision and their effects on  and  adjustment."
"Do parenting styles matter? Perceived dimensions of parenting styles, creative abilities and creative self-beliefs in adolescents",2020,"On a sample of 552 high school students, the   investigated the relationships between perceived  dimensions, and 's creative abilities assessed by the Test for Creative Thinking-Drawing Production (TCT-DP) as well as their creative self-beliefs (i.e. creative self efficacy and creative personal identity). Results indicated that the dimension of al  acceptance and autonomy support were weakly but positively related to 's creative self efficacy and creative personal identity. However, no statistically significant relationship was found between al autonomy support and 's creative abilities. In this sense, this  provides preliminary evidence for the effect of al  dimensions on 's creative self-beliefs. Implications and limitations of this  were discussed. Recommendations are  given to ers for conducting further studies on the topic."
Emerging Behavior Problems: Bidirectional Relations Between Maternal and Paternal Parenting Styles With Infant Temperament,2019,"The   examined bidirectional effects between maternal and paternal   (authoritative, authoritarian, permissive) and infant temperament (negative affect, orienting/regulatory capacity, surgency) in a diverse sample of 201 mothers and 151 fathers. Using 3 waves of longitudinal data (prenatal, 6 months, and 18 months), this  examined (a) whether maternal and paternal   prospectively predicted infant temperament; (b) whether mother-and father-reported infant temperament domains predicted   at 18 months; and (c) whether infant temperament and   at 6 months predicted -reported externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors at 18 months. Mothers and fathers reported on their expected   at all three waves, infant temperament at 6 months, and their toddler's emerging internalizing and externalizing problems at 18 months. Prospective   effects revealed that maternal authoritative and permissive   predicted infant orienting/regulatory capacity. Child evocative effects indicated infant orienting/regulatory capacity and negative affect predicted greater maternal permissive  . Significant prospective   effects on infant temperament and  evocative effects on paternal   were largely not observed. Several   and infant temperament domains at 6 months predicted toddlers' externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors but  differed by . Findings suggest maternal prenatal perceptions of   predict infant temperament, but temperament can  affect subsequent . More  is needed to identify fathers' bidirectional effects including how fathering is affected by their 's characteristics."
Early Adolescents' Perceptions of Mothers' and Fathers' Parenting Styles and Problem Behavior,2010,"We investigated early adolescents' perceptions of   in mother-father-adolescent triads along with  self-reported problem behaviors (substance abuse and delinquency). We  examined the various combinations of mothers' and fathers'   by  gender in relation to problem behavior. Participants included 3,353  (aged 12 to 14) from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-97. Results from our structural equation model indicated that mothers and fathers may use different  strategies and that permissive  may not be as detrimental as previously assumed. In addition, youth perceptions of each  were equally important in explaining problem behavior among both daughters and sons, but the perception of an authoritarian mother showed stronger adverse effects on sons, even after controlling for poverty and peer influence."
"Parenting Style, Locus of Control, and Oral Hygiene in Adolescents",2012,"Objective. The aim of the  was to test if variations in oral hygiene levels in adolescents were associated with locus of control and   after controlling for demographic factors. Material and Methods. The  sample comprised 237 adolescents aged 12-13 years. The structured questionnaire included demographic characteristics and items about   and locus of control. The Individual Quantitative Plaque % Index (IQPI) and tooth brushing frequency were used as clinical outcome measures. Results. In the bivariate analyses, socioeconomic status (P=0.012), number of  in the family (P=0.003), and frequency of toothbrushing (P=0.001) were related to dental plaque levels. Gender (P<0.001), socioeconomic status (P=0.022), and external locus of control (Spearman rho, -0.144, P=0.027) were statistically significantly associated with tooth brushing frequency. In the multivariate analyses, only socioeconomic status and toothbrushing frequency were statistically significantly related to the IQPI. When toothbrushing frequency as the second outcome variable was used, the IQPI and gender were statistically significant. The association with socioeconomic status did not reach statistical significance (P=0.07). Conclusions. Only socioeconomic status and toothbrushing frequency explained variation in dental plaque levels among adolescents. The expected relationship among  , locus of control, and oral hygiene levels was not confirmed."
The interaction of DRD2 and parenting style in predicting creativity,2018,"The   examined the interaction of dopamine D2 receptor gene (DRD2) and   on creativity. Participants were 427 Chinese undergraduate students from a project designed to identify the genetic basis of creativity. The  showed that there was significant interaction between DRD2 and authoritarian  when predicting creativity. Specifically, it was found that the negative effect of mother/father authoritarianism on creativity was only  when individuals were carriers of DRD2 Del (rs1799732) allele. No significant interaction of DRD2 and authoritative or permissive  was found. In conclusion, the   provides the first preliminary evidence for the effect of DRD2- interaction on creativity; future studies are warranted to validate these findings."
"Cross-sectional associations between maternal parenting styles, physical activity and screen sedentary time in ",2017,"Background: Children's activity level, including physical activity (PA) and screen sedentary time (SST), is influenced by environmental factors in which s play a critical role. Different types of   may influence 's activity level. Inconsistent  were found on the association between   and PA, and few studies tested the association between   and SST. This  examined the association between  , PA and SST and the modifying effect of 's gender and maternal educational level on these associations. Methods: Cross-sectional data were collected from s of  aged 8-11 years old who completed a web-based non-standardized questionnaire (N = 4047). Since 85% of the questionnaires were filled in by mothers,   are mainly reported by mothers. Multiple linear regression techniques were used to assess the associations between   (authoritative, permissive, authoritarian and neglectful), and PA and SST (mean min/day). The modifying effect of 's gender and maternal educational level on these associations was explored. P values <=.0125 were considered as statistically significant based on the Bonferroni correction for four primary analyses. Results: The neglectful   was most widely used (35.3%), while the authoritarian  was least common (14.8%). No significant association was found between   and PA level. As regards SST, an authoritative   was significantly associated with lower SST in boys while a neglectful   was significantly associated with higher SST in both boys and girls. When the mother had a medium educational level, an authoritative   was significantly associated with lower SST while neglectful  was significantly associated with higher SST. Conclusions: No association was found between   and PA. However, an authoritative   was associated with a reduction in SST and a neglectful   with an increase in SST, especially in boys and in  whose mother had a medium education level. Future studies of  practices are needed to gain more insight into the role of s in 's PA and SST levels, as a basis for the development of interventions tailored to support s in stimulating PA and reducing SST in ."
Comparing Bedouin and Jewish parents' parenting styles and practices,2020,"The  examined the differences in   and practices between Bedouin and Jewish s of adolescents in Israel, using the s' self-reports to screen their . It included two separate samples of 172 Jewish s (32 fathers and 140 mothers) and 128 Bedouin s (76 fathers and 52 mothers), whose ages range from 23 to 60 (M = 43.70, SD = 7.61) and from 27 to 60 (M = 42.72, SD = 5.88) respectively. Bedouin s were found to be more Authoritarian (mainly in terms of harsh discipline methods including corporal punishment) and less Authoritative (in terms of warmth and support) and Permissive than Jewish s. These differences did not interact with the s' sex. Although relatively more Authoritarian, the Bedouin s perceived themselves as significantly more Authoritative than Authoritarian. The article's conclusion carefully suggests that the northern Bedouin families are undergoing a gradual change in their al authority."
"Parenting styles or practices? Parenting, sympathy, and prosocial behaviors among adolescents",2007,"In the  , the authors examined the relations among  , al practices, sympathy, and prosocial behaviors in adolescents. The participants were 233 adolescents (M age = 16.7 years; 69% girls; mostly White) from public high schools in the Midwestern region of the United States who completed measures of prosocial behaviors,  ,  practices, and sympathy. Overall, the authors found evidence that  practices were significantly associated with adolescents' prosocial behaviors. However, the associations between  practices and prosocial behaviors occurred mostly through the indirect relations with sympathy. The relations among  practices, sympathy, and prosocial behaviors varied as a function of the specific  practice and the specific prosocial behavior. Implications for future  on the  of prosocial development and  among adolescents are discussed."
Examination of the Predictive Power of Flourishing Based on Parenting Styles and Mindfulness,2020,"The purpose of the  was to examine the relationship between   and mindfulness with flourishing. Flourishing reveals the miracle hidden within human existence. The idea of flourishing is a pervasive idea that could include a wide range of ultimate constructs like a scientific command, personality development, generative deed, profession, religion, community building, love, charity activities, loyalty to people, self-efficacy, material well-being, enjoyment, and so on. Thus, predicting such an issue can lead to community building and people excellence. The  was correlational. The sample consisted of 350 men and women of 20-30 years of age selected by the random sampling method from among Shiraz students and citizens. Everyone filled out three questionnaires: Boer's mindfulness, Steinberg's  , and Diener's flourishing. The  showed a negative significant relationship between flourishing and al conflict."
Parenting styles and overweight status in first grade,2006,"OBJECTIVE. The goal was to determine the relationship between the 4   ( authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and neglectful) and overweight status in first grade. METHODS. Data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development were analyzed. Children with complete data for  parameters at 54 months and measured weight and height in first grade were included in the analysis. Overweight was defined as BMI of >= 95th percentile. The 4   were constructed with 2 scales, namely, maternal sensitivity and maternal expectations for  self-control. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between   and overweight in first grade, controlling for gender, race, maternal education, income/needs ratio, marital status, and  behavior problems. RESULTS. A total of 872 , 11.1% overweight and 82.8% white, were included in the analysis. Children of authoritarian mothers (n = 298) had an increased risk of being overweight, compared with  of authoritative mothers (n = 179). Children of permissive (n = 132) and neglectful (n = 263) mothers were twice as likely to be overweight, compared with  of authoritative mothers. Of the covariates, only income/needs ratio was significant and did not alter the relationship between   and overweight risk. CONCLUSIONS. Among the 4  , authoritarian  was associated with the highest risk of overweight among young . Understanding the mechanisms through which   are associated with overweight risk may lead to the development of more-comprehensive and better-targeted interventions."
Maternal Parenting Style and Delinquency by Race and the Moderating Effect of Structural Disadvantage,2018,"Contemporary  suggests authoritative  is the most effective   in deterring juvenile delinquency. Some  has found there are differences in   between racial groups due to structural disadvantage faced by marginalized individuals. Yet, relatively little is known about how racial differences in  and the moderating effect of disadvantage relate to juvenile delinquency. The current project explores   differences among Black, Hispanic, and White mothers and the moderating impact of disadvantage on delinquency. Results indicate authoritarian  is least effective in deterring delinquency among all racial groups; however, neighborhood disadvantage provides a negative moderating effect between authoritarian  and delinquency for Black youth only, whereas uninvolved  was related to delinquency for White youth only."

Maternal and paternal parenting styles as a whole: validation of the simple form of the Parenting Style Evaluation Scale,2021,"Oliva's Escala para la Evaluacion del Estilo al (EEEP) [Scale for the evaluation of  ] asks adolescents about their s' education  separately (`your father and your mother) or in a combined way (your s), but only the separated version has been tested for validity. The objective of this work was to carry out a validation of the combined version. A sample of 1507 adolescents, aged 12 to 18 years, was recruitrd. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were run in two independent subsamples. Then, structural equation models (SEM) were run in order to test the association between the EEEP's subscales and adolescent outcomes (optimism, pessimism, and academic achievement). Results showed a good fit of the instruments' structure. Furthermore, the subscales showed associations with the outcomes. The EEEP can be reliably used in its combined form, which  in a reduction of items, often beneficial for ."
Physical Activity Among Israeli-Arab Adolescent Males: How Do Parenting Styles Matter?,2018,"Physical activity contains many benefits for adolescents' physical and mental health, and  for building healthy living routines and habits for the future. The current  examined the associations between   and adolescents' physical activity among Israeli-Arab families of male adolescents, in seeking to boost the limited information on this most important topic. Participants consisted of 177 male Israeli-Arab adolescents (M = 13.93, SD = 1.42) with normal weight. Controlling for the participants' age, weight, and grades in school,   explained about 30% of the variance in the participants' reports of their physical activity, with the authoritative and authoritarian  inversely correlated with the latter variable. Adolescents who perceived their s as authoritative were reportedly more physically active than their counterparts who perceived their s as authoritarian. In common with previous studies, the findings suggest that authoritative  may be a cross-culturally preferable  in fostering a desired physical activity rate among adolescents."

The Moderating Effects of Gratitude on the Association Between Perceived Parenting Styles and Suicidal Ideation,2017,"Suicidal ideation is defined as the thoughts about engaging in suicidal-related behaviors. Very few studies have been conducted on 's suicidal ideation as there is a biased perception that suicidal behavior under the age of 12 is scarce. However, suicide is the leading cause of death among young . Child suicidal ideation is predictive of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in adulthood. Association between certain   and suicidal ideation have been found in empirical studies. However, little is known about the role of  and suicidal ideation in Chinese young . We examined whether gratitude can reduce the risk of suicide by moderating the association between   and  suicidal ideation. We recruited 447 Chinese  (53.3% female; mean age = 10.06, SD = 1.76) to participate in a survey. Perceived   (warmth/accepting, dominating, and autonomy granting), gratitude, and suicidal ideation were assessed using self-reported measures. We found that all three perceived al  were significantly associated with  suicidal ideation. Further, gratitude was found to have a significant moderating effect on suicidal ideation, across the analysis of the three perceived  . This suggests that gratitude may be adopted in preventive and clinical interventions so that  at risk can benefit from reducing the negative effects of ineffective   and suicidal ideation."
Predicting Child Physical Activity and Screen Time: Parental Support for Physical Activity and General Parenting Styles,2014,"Objective: To examine relationships between   and practices and  moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and screen time. Methods: Participants were  (6.9 +/- 1.8 years) with a body mass index in the 70-95th percentile and their s (421 dyads). -completed questionnaires assessed al support for  physical activity (PA),   and  screen time. Children wore accelerometers to assess MVPA. Results:   did not predict MVPA, but support for PA did (positive association). The association between support and MVPA, moreover, varied as a function of permissive . For s high in permissiveness, the association was positive (greater support was related to greater MVPA and therefore protective). For s low in permissiveness, the association was neutral; support did not matter. Authoritarian and permissive   were both associated with greater screen time. Conclusions:  practices and  should be considered jointly, offering implications for tailored interventions."

A cross-sectional  was performed in Portugal as part of the Pro Children cross-sectional European survey. Portuguese mothers (n 1601) of 11-13-year-old school  were included in the  . A self-administered questionnaire was developed to assess fruit and vegetable consumption as well as the  . Fruit and vegetable consumption was assessed by a validated FFQ.   based on two dimensions - strictness and involvement - were classified into authoritative, authoritarian, indulgent and neglectful. The higher mean intakes of fruit, vegetables and total fruit and vegetables were observed for mothers classified as indulgent, whereas the lower mean intakes were observed for mothers classified as neglectful. Differences in intake among   were significant for fruit, vegetables and total fruit and vegetables. When partial correlations were calculated between the two dimensions, strictness and involvement (controlled one for the other), and intakes, only involvement was positively associated with fruit, vegetables and total fruit and vegetable intake. Findings from the   show that fruit and vegetable consumption of Portuguese mothers of school  seems to be related to their own  , especially with the dimension involvement. Future interventions to promote fruit and vegetable intake should take into account these variables."

Does Parenting Style Affect Adolescent IBD Transition Readiness and Self-Efficacy Scores?,2021,"Background: Transition to adult-centered care requires adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to acquire a set of independent self-management skills. Transition success can be affected by maturity, cognitive development, and many other factors. Our hypothesis was that   would be associated with increased self-efficacy and therefore transitions readiness. Methods: A prospective cohort survey  of adolescents with IBD and their s from October 2018 to October 2019 was performed. Participants completed the IBD-Self-Efficacy Scale- Adolescent questionnaire (IBD-SES-A) and the Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ). s completed the  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ-short form). Demographic and disease information were  collected. Results: Sixty-nine participants were included for full analysis (36 males and 33 females); mean age was 18.2 years, and average age of IBD diagnosis 13 years. Overall, 83% of participants were non-Hispanic Caucasian, and 84% reported al annual income over USD 100,000. All 69 s reported an authoritative  . Females have significantly higher TRAQ scores than males (p = 0.0004). TRAQ scores differed significantly between age groups, with 20 to 22 years old having higher scores (p <= 0.0001). TRAQ and IBD-SES-A scores did not differ by al education or  . Conclusion: Given the inability to delineate different , this  was unable to demonstrate a protective   associated with better transitions readiness and self-efficacy scores in adolescents with IBD. Within the context of authoritative , we did find that females and older adolescents had higher transition readiness scores. Additional  into psychosocial determinants of transition readiness, and the importance of multidisciplinary management with an integrated team including psychologist and social workers, can help improve IBD transition outcomes."

Parenting Style and Generativity Measured in College Students and Their Parents,2014,"The logical consistency between generativity and the authoritative   led to the hypothesis that the two behavior patterns or orientations were related. Survey measurements of perceived   (authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive) and generativity in 559 university students and their respective s were compared. The authoritative   correlated positively with generativity for both students and s. Both students and mothers scored significantly higher on generativity than fathers, but no significant difference was found between students' and mothers' generativity. Hierarchical regression showed that students' generativity was proximally related to their perceptions of their mothers' authoritative  , their mothers' reports of  , and their mothers' generativity. Father's generativity or   did not make any additional contributions. The pattern of  suggested that generativity is a learned orientation and more often from mothers than from fathers.

Hierarchical linear regression analyses assessed the moderating role of   on the association between pubertal timing and adolescent smoking behavior. Results: The  indicated that   moderates the relationship between pubertal timing and adolescent smoking behavior. For male adolescents, father rejection moderated the relationship between early pubertal timing and smoking behavior. For female adolescents, father rejection, father emotional warmth, and mother emotional warmth moderated the relationship between pubertal timing and smoking behavior. Conclusions: Findings from the  highlight the importance of  , which may influence the negative outcomes associated with early pubertal timing and can help improve interventions aimed at reducing these negative outcomes."
"Parenting Style, Discipline, and Parental Psychopathology: Gender Dyadic Interactions in Emerging Adults",2018,"Regarding al influences on  adjustment,  has examined al and  gender separately more often than the interaction between them. Thus, the current  investigated the effects of  , discipline practices, and al psychological symptoms in - gender dyads. The sample consisted of 177 male and 313 female emerging adults who ranged in age from 18 to 24 years and reported they were primarily White and African American. Participants reported on al characteristics including perceived  , discipline practices, and al psychological symptoms in addition to their own psychological symptoms. Results indicated that  and emerging adult gender moderated some relationships. Notably, interaction effects suggested that higher levels of authoritative  were associated with higher levels of emerging adult psychological symptoms. This unexpected finding may indicate that s provide less authoritative  to high functioning emerging adults compared to those who have problems, or that emerging adults perceive high levels of authoritative  during this time in their lives as problematic. Thus, effective  may vary as a function of 's development."
"Child temperament, parenting discipline style, and daytime behavior in hood sleep disorders",1997,"Fifty-two  without significant sleep disturbance seen at a primary care clinic for well- care were compared on measures of temperament,  , daytime behavior, and overall sleep disturbance to three diagnostic subgroups identified in a pediatric sleep clinic:  with obstructive sleep apnea (n = 33), parasomnias (night terrors, sleepwalking, etc.) (n = 16), and behavioral sleep disorders (limit-setting disorder, etc.) (n = 31). The mean age of the entire sample was 5.7 years. Temperamental emotionality in the behavioral sleep disorders group was associated with a higher level of sleep disturbance (p < .001);  laxness was associated with sleep disturbance in the general pediatric population (p < .01); and intense and negative temperament characteristics seemed to be associated with clinically significant behavioral sleep disturbances. Ineffective   and daytime disruptive behaviors were more likely to be associated with the milder sleep disturbances found in  in a primary care setting."
Reciprocal Relationship Between Parenting Styles and Interpersonal Personality in Chinese Adolescents,2021,"This  examined the reciprocal relations between the   and adolescents' interpersonal personality in China. A total of 722 sixth-grade Chinese junior high school students reported their interpersonal relatedness (IR) personality trait and perceived   of their s. Of these students, 411 completed the survey again in eighth grade. One  of each student rated their  . The  indicated that perceived paternal rejection negatively predicted adolescents' IR 2 years later, whereas perceived paternal behavioral controlling positively predicted adolescents' IR 2 years later. IR  positively predicted perceived paternal warmth 2 years later. Significant reciprocal association between adolescents' IR and perceived maternal rejection was found. -rated behavioral control negatively predicted adolescents' IR, whereas -rated filial piety positively predicted adolescents' IR. The  were discussed in the Chinese context."
Parenting Styles and their Influence on Child's Dental Behavior and Caries Status: An Analytical Cross-Sectional Study,2020,"Aim: The   aimed to evaluate the association between  , 's behavior in dental setting and dental caries status. Study design: Children aged 3-7 years on their first dental visit were included in the . Their s were asked to complete  Style Dimension Questionnaire (PSDQ) to assess their  . Oral prophylaxis was performed for the  and their behavior was assessed using Frankl behavior rating scale. Their caries status was recorded using DMFT/deft index. Results: Out of 315 s, 240 s exhibited authoritative  , 45 exhibited permissive and 30 exhibited authoritarian  . Permissive  was associated with four-fold increase in the 's negative dental behavior and authoritarian  showed two fold increase in the negative behavior of  compared to authoritative . Children of both authoritative and authoritarian s showed less caries status and the permissive  depicted threefold increase in the caries status compared to authoritative . Conclusion: Children of both the permissive and authoritarian s showed more negative dental behavior than  of authoritative s. Children of permissive s showed increased caries status compared to the  of authoritative s."
The impact of parenting styles on the development of social media literacy,2015,"While a lot of  on social media tends to focus on either the benefits or risks of social media for adolescents, scholars have paid less attention to how adolescents actually use these media. In this paper, we focus on the impact of   on the development of adolescents' social media literacy concerning the use of Facebook. Our  consists of a large-scale survey with a sample of 1,319 adolescents and 27 in-depth interviews. We use the perceived   to investigate adolescents' use of social media in general and their use of Facebook in particular. When looking at levels of social media literacy concerning Facebook, we find significant differences between teenagers who encounter authoritative or permissive  ; adolescents whose s adopt an authoritative  score better on items related to critical skills, while respondents with permissive s have more freedom in their use of Facebook and score better on technical competencies."
Parenting With Style: Altruism and Paternalism in Intergenerational Preference Transmission,2017,"We develop a theory of - relations that rationalizes the choice between alternative   (as set out in Baumrind, 1967). s maximize an objective function that combines Beckerian altruism and paternalism towards . They can affect their 's choices via two channels: either by influencing 's preferences or by imposing direct restrictions on their choice sets. Different   (authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive) emerge as equilibrium outcomes and are affected both by al preferences and by the socioeconomic environment.  , in turn, feeds back into the 's welfare and economic success. The theory is consistent with the decline of authoritarian  observed in industrialized countries and with the greater prevalence of more permissive  in countries characterized by low inequality."
The role of depression in perceived parenting style among patients with anxiety disorders,2011,"Despite a long tradition of  on the relationship between   and anxiety disorders, few studies have taken the effect of comorbid depression into account. This  investigated perceived  in 504 outpatients with panic disorder/agoraphobia, social phobia or obsessive compulsive disorder, and in 210 psychology students. The anxiety group reported both s as less caring and their fathers as more controlling than did the student group. However, these between-group differences disappeared when taking self-reported depressive symptoms into consideration. Also no differences in al  were found between the three diagnostic anxiety groups, when depressive symptoms were taken into account. Self-reported depressive symptoms were more consistently associated with negatively perceived   than with self-reported anxiety symptoms in both the anxiety group and the student group. Results do not support theories of al control as a specific risk factor for anxiety disorders, but they are in accordance with prior findings showing an association between depression and perceived lack of al care.

"Parenting Styles, Socialization, and the Transmission of Political Ideology and Partisanship",2012,"While  has long shown that s are first and foremost among the agents of political socialization, substantial evidence suggests there is a great deal of variation in the transmission of political values from s to their . This article attempts to explain some of this variation by examining how  -as reed by the - relational context in terms of dimensions of al control and affect-affects the intergenerational transmission of political attributes. In particular, it evaluates how differences in   influence the intergenerational transmission of political ideology and partisan identification. Findings based on original data collected from a sample of mother-offspring dyads show that differences in   play an important moderating role in the variable transmission of al political values. Further, these  add a new dimension to the  of political socialization by demonstrating the role of   in the transmission of political values."
The Predictive Role of the Parenting Styles That Cause Early Maladaptive Schemas on Divorce Indicators,2020,"This  aims to investigate the relationship between the   that cause early maladaptive schemas and divorce indicators of married and divorce people. While   are based on schema therapy, divorce predictors are based on the Gottman approach to couples therapy. Data have been obtained from 600 participants (316 male, 284 female) from 51 out of the 81 cities in Turkey. Of all the participants, 511 (85.3%) are married while 89 (14.7%) are divorced.   have been measure using the Young  Inventory, and divorce indicators have been measured using the Divorce Predictors Scale. The data were analyzed with SPSS 22.0. Correlation and hierarchical multiple regression analyses have been used to examine the  questions. The correlation analysis shows divorce indicators to be significantly associated with all   from both mothers and fathers. According to the  from the hierarchical multiple regression analysis, however, overly permissive/boundary-less, normative, emotionally depriving, and punitive   from both mothers and fathers significantly predict divorce indicators. The analyses have  revealed punitive and overly permissive/boundary-less   to be suppressor variables. The findings indicate that overly permissive/boundary-less, normative, emotionally depriving, and punitive   significantly predict divorce indicators. These findings show that s should be neither too dominant nor too permissive while raising  and should enforce boundaries with their  for the 's adjustment to marriage in the future."
Perceived Parenting Style and Adolescent Adjustment: Revisiting Directions of Effects and the Role of Parental Knowledge,2012,"In the   on  and adolescent behavior, there is much focus on reciprocal, bidirectional, and transactional processes, but -  still adheres to a unidirectional perspective in which s affect youth behavior but are unaffected by it. In addition, many of the most cited - studies have used measures of al behavioral control that are questionable because they include measures of al knowledge. The goals of this  were to determine whether including knowledge items might have affected  of past studies and to test the unidirectional assumption. Data were from 978 adolescents participating in a longitudinal . - and adolescent adjustment measures at 2 time points were used, with a 2-year interval between time points. A variety of internal and external adjustment measures were used. Results showed that including knowledge items in measures of al behavioral control elevated links between behavioral control and adjustment. Thus, the  and conclusions of many of the most highly cited studies are likely to have been stronger than if the measures had focused strictly on al behavior. In addition, adolescent adjustment predicted changes in authoritative and neglectful   more robustly than these  predicted changes in adolescent adjustment. Adolescent adjustment  predicted changes in authoritativeness more robustly than authoritativeness predicted changes in adjustment. Thus,   cannot be seen as independent of the adolescent. In summary, both the theoretical premises of -  and the prior findings should be revisited."
Parenting styles and bullying. The mediating role of parental psychological aggression and physical punishment,2016,"Studies concerning   and disciplinary practices have shown a relationship between both factors and bullying involvement in adolescence. The scarce available evidence suggests that abusive disciplinary practices increase teenagers' vulnerability to abuse in school or the likelihood of them becoming abusers of their peers in the same context. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the indirect effect of   in adolescents' bullying involvement through disciplinary practices, although a relationship between   and disciplinary practices has been shown. The aim of this  was to determine the mediating role of punitive al discipline (physical punishment and psychological aggression) between the dimensions of s'   and their 's involvement in bullying victimization and aggression. We used a sample comprising 2060 Spanish high school students (47.9% girls; mean age = 14.34). Structural equation modeling was performed to analyze the data. The  confirmed the mediating role of al discipline between the  practices analyzed and students' aggression and victimization. Significant gender-related differences were found for aggression involvement, where boys were for the most part linked to psychological aggression disciplinary practices and girls to physical punishment. Victimization directly correlated with al psychological aggression discipline behavior across both sexes. In conclusion, the  seem to suggest that non-democratic   favor the use of punitive discipline, which increases the risk of adolescents' bullying involvement. Therefore, intervention programs must involve s to make them aware about the important role they play in this process and to improve their  . Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

High school students' career decision-making pattern across parenting styles and parental attachment levels,2010,"Introduction. The purpose of this  was to investigate career decision among high school students regarding to their   (authoritative, authoritarian, indulgent, and neglectful) and al attachment levels. Method. With this purpose, 382 (200 females; 182 males) Turkish high school students aged 14-18 completed Career Decision Inventory, The  Style Inventory and The Inventory of  Attachment, as measures of career decision,  syle and al attachment levels, respectively. For analyzing the data one way ANOVA was performed. Results. Results of the  demonstrated that  of more authoritative and authoritarian s were found more decisive than the  of neglectful and indulgent s. In terms of attachment levels, significant differences were found among all sub-scales of CDI. Furthermore, students who experienced a medium degree of attachment to their s were found more decisive than the ones experiencing low or high degree of attachment. Discussion. Therfore, the effects of   and  attechment levels on career decision-making pattern have to be taken into consideration regarding to career development and career choice of adolescents. Further  should explore the explanation of career decision in terms of   and attachment levels for different gender and age groups in order to identify relevant determinants at each age level and for females and males separately."
Parenting Styles and Short- and Long-term Socialization Outcomes: A Study among Spanish Adolescents and Older Adults,2018,"In this , the association between   and short- and long-term socialization outcomes was analyzed using a two-dimensional model of four types of  . The socialization outcomes analyzed were self-esteem and internalization of social values. Participants were a sample of Spanish adolescents (n = 571) and older adults (n = 527). Results showed that both adolescents and older adults from indulgent families reported equal or even higher self-esteem than those from authoritative households, whereas those from neglectful and authoritarian homes were consistently associated with the lowest levels of self-esteem. Regarding internalization of social values, adolescents and older adults raised in indulgent and authoritative families prioritized self-transcendence values (universalism and benevolence) and conservation values (security, conformity, and tradition) as compared to those from authoritarian and neglectful homes, whereas those from neglectful and authoritarian families showed lower scores in all internalization of social values measures. These  suggest that the combination of high levels of al warmth and involvement and low levels of strictness and imposition (i.e., indulgent  ) is an optimum  strategy in the cultural context where the  was conducted, and that the link between   and socialization outcomes share a common short- and long- term pattern."
The effects of parenting styles on each personal growth initiative and self-esteem among Japanese university students,2018,"This  investigated the extent to which individual differences in personal growth initiative (PGI) and self-esteem are effected by  . The sample consisted of 329 Japanese university students. The al Authority Questionnaire (PAQ) measuring three   (authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive), the PGI, and the self-esteem scale were used to guide data collection. Multiple regression analyses showed that PGI and self-esteem were significantly affected by the authoritative  . The   showed that most of the subscales of PGI and self-esteem were not significantly affected by the authoritarian   whereas, for female students, readiness for change which is subscale of PGI was significantly affected by the authoritarian  . On the other hand, PGI and self-esteem were not significantly affected by the permissive  . These  indicate the importance of the influence of the authoritative   on each PGI and self-esteem among Japanese university students."
Prevalence of Child Maltreatment and Its Association with Parenting Style: A Population Study in Hong Kong,2019,"Previous studies point to a link between   and  maltreatment, but evidence from a Chinese context is lacking. We investigated the association between   and  maltreatment in Hong Kong, and examined whether family socio-economic status and  gender moderate this relationship. Using stratified random sampling, 7585  in Grade 1 to Grade 3 of 51 schools in Hong Kong were recruited and their s were invited to complete the questionnaire. The past year weighted prevalence for minor physical abuse, severe/very severe physical abuse, psychological abuse, and neglect were 63.9%, 23.4%, 84.1%, and 23.2%, respectively. Authoritarian  was associated with all types of  maltreatment (prevalence ratio (PR) range: 1.10-1.53; p < 0.001), whereas authoritative  was associated with a lower risk of all types of  maltreatment (PR range: 0.89-0.97; p < 0.001). Child maltreatment is prevalent in Hong Kong and is strongly associated with  . The association was significantly stronger among girls and those with higher family socioeconomic status.

Differences in Perceived Parenting Style Between Mothers and Fathers: Implications for Child Outcomes and Marital Conflict,2016,"The current  focused on relations between maternal and paternal perceived  , marital conflict, and  behavior outcomes. Child participants (N = 152) ranged in age from 3 to 9 years old. Reports from both s on perceived  , marital conflict, and  behavior problems were collected. Results indicated that (a)   of mothers and fathers were related, (b) mothers' and fathers' authoritarianism and permissiveness were associated with increased  internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, (c) marital conflict was significantly related to  behavior problems, (d) when mother and father reported   differed, increased marital conflict was reported, (e) increased differences between mothers and fathers in self- and spouse-perceived permissiveness were related to increased  externalizing behavior problems, and (f) the direction of the differences between s (i.e. whether a particular  reported being more permissive than the other) was linked with marital conflict and  behavior problems. Namely, marital and  outcomes were poorer when mothers saw themselves as more authoritative than fathers and when fathers were more authoritarian than mothers, and outcomes were better when fathers saw themselves as more permissive than mothers and when mothers were more authoritarian than fathers. Implications for marital and family therapy are discussed."
Impact of Parenting Styles on Psychological Flexibility Among Adolescents of Pakistan: A Cross-Sectional Study,,"The   and psychological flexibility have been significant variables; however, little empirical work has addressed the impact of  in terms of the expansion of psychological flexibility.

A total sample of 100 adolescents (50 boys and 50 girls) whose ages ranged between 12 and 18 years without any previous psychiatric and medical history were recruited from different educational institutes of Pakistan. Results revealed that   are positively associated with psychological flexibility (r = 0.75, p < 0.05). Moreover,   significantly predict psychological flexibility among adolescents (p < 0.05). However, no gender differences were found across both variables among adolescents. These findings have highlighted the significance of   and psychological flexibility with respect to the mental health of adolescents."
Effects of parenting style and involvement in sibling conflict on adolescent sibling relationships,2011,"This  examined relationships among maternal and paternal  , patterns of involvement in adolescent sibling conflict, and sibling relationship quality. Students (N = 272) in grades 9 and 11 from a public high school in a metropolitan area of the Northeastern US completed measures of  , al sibling conflict intervention , sibling closeness, sibling support, and sibling warmth and conflict. An authoritative   was associated with sibling support and closeness. Cluster analyses identified gender-specific patterns of al involvement. Participants reporting maternal or paternal coaching involvement  reported greater sibling warmth compared with those who did not report such patterns. The  highlight indirect and direct relationships between al behavior and sibling relationship quality. In addition, the  identifies the existence of a meaningful typology of al involvement in sibling conflict."
The relationship between parenting styles and fourth graders' levels of empathy and aggressiveness,2021,"This survey-based  examines the relationship between, on the one hand, the empathy and aggressiveness levels of 634 randomly selected Turkish fourth graders, and on the other, their perceptions of their mothers' and fathers'  . Its data-collection tools consisted of a Background Information Form, the Scale of Empathy for Children, the  Style Scale, and the Aggressiveness Scale. Analysis revealed that the sampled 's empathy skills did not differ significantly according to gender, age, school type (private/public), or al monthly income, but did vary significantly according to their number of siblings. The fourth graders' aggressiveness levels, in contrast, did not exhibit any significant differences according to number of their siblings, school type, or income, but did vary significantly with gender and age. There was  a negative correlation between the 's aggressiveness levels and their perceptions related to all dimensions of the  Style Scale (i.e., psychological autonomy, acceptance/involvement, and strictness/supervision), but no significant relationship between their empathy levels and such perceptions. Lastly, no significant relationship was detected between the surveyed 's empathy skills and aggressiveness levels."
The association between hood gender atypical behavior and adult psychiatric symptoms is moderated by parenting style,2008,"The association between hood gender atypical behavior (GAB) i. e. behavior traditionally considered more typical for  of the opposite sex, and adult psychiatric symptoms as well as cold or over-controlling   as a moderator of the association were studied in a sample of 1767 Finnish participants aged 33 to 43 years (M = 37.5). Participants completed the Gender Identity/Gender Role Questionnaire, the Brief Symptom Inventory 18, and the Measure of  Style. Regression analyses showed that women recalled more GAB than men did, and that participants who recalled more GAB reported significantly more psychiatric symptoms. Negative   was associated with psychiatric symptoms. Structural equation modeling showed that   significantly moderated the association between hood GAB and adult psychiatric symptoms with positive  reducing the association and negative  sustaining it."
Constellations of Maternal and Paternal Parenting Styles in Adolescence: Congruity and Well-Being,2008,"The current  examined patterns of maternal and paternal   in adolescence and the variations in adolescent well-being as a function of   combinations. Participants included 272 students in grades 9 and 11 from a public high school in a large city in the northeastern United States. Participants completed measures of perceived maternal and paternal   and indices of psychological well-being. Distinct patterns of maternal and paternal  constellations were established. The most common constellation found was the combination of a neglectful mother and a neglectful father. Participants with either both s authoritative or only mother authoritative reported higher well-being than participants with no authoritative . Participants with no permissive  or with a permissive mother scored lower on selfesteem than participants with only a permissive father. Finally, participants with either  neglectful or both s neglectful scored lower on self-esteem than participants without a neglectful . The current  illustrates the need to examine constellations of maternal and paternal  in studies assessing the familial variables contributing to adolescent well-being."
Child-To-Parent Violence: Which Parenting Style Is More Protective? A Study with Spanish Adolescents,2019,"The link between   and violent behavior during adolescence has become a relevant topic of  over the last few years. In order to deepen the understanding of this relationship, the aim of the   was to examine what type of   (authoritative, indulgent, authoritarian, and neglectful) is more protective against -to- violence (CPV). A total of 2112 adolescents of both sexes participated in this  (50.2% men and 49.8% women), aged between 12 and 18 years (M = 14. 72, SD = 1.55). A multivariate factorial design (MANOVA, 4 x 2 x 3) was applied using  , sex, and age group (12-14, 15-16, and 17-18 years) as independent variables and dimensions of CPV (physical and verbal aggression against the mother and father) as dependent variables. As shown in the , the lowest scores on all the dimensions of CPV examined corresponded to the adolescents from indulgent families. Further, two interaction effects were observed between   and age in verbal aggression against the mother and verbal aggression against the father. Regarding these effects, the adolescents from indulgent families obtained the lowest scores in two of the three age groups analyzed (12-14 years and 15-16 years). In the 17-18 years group, adolescents from authoritative families obtained similar but lower values than those coming from families with an indulgent  of . These findings suggest that indulgent  is the most protective   against CPV and  highlight the importance of affective warmth, emotional nurturance, and support giving in preventing CPV."
"Parenting  with down syndrome: An analysis of parenting styles, parenting dimensions, and parental stress",2017,"Background: Effective  is vital for a 's development. Although much work has been conducted on  typically developing , little work has examined   with Down syndrome. Aims: The purpose of the current  was to compare the   and dimensions in mothers of  with DS and mothers of TD . Methods and procedures: Thirty-five mothers of  with DS and 47 mothers of TD  completed questionnaires about , al stress,  behavior problems, and  executive function. Outcomes and : We found that mothers of  with DS use an authoritative   less and a permissive   more than mothers of TD . Additionally, we found that mothers of  with DS use reasoning/induction and verbal hostility less and ignoring misbehavior more than mothers of TD . All of these differences, except for those of reasoning/induction, were at least partially accounted for by the higher levels of al stress in the DS group. Conclusions and implications:  interventions should be focused on reducing al stress and training mothers to  under stress in an effort to improve  techniques, which would, in theory, improve long-term  outcomes for  with DS."

Links Between Israeli College Students' Self-Regulated Learning and Their Recollections of Their Parents' Parenting Styles,2020,"  affects self-regulation in school pupils, yet its long-term influence on academic behavior is rarely studied. A pilot  was conducted on 83 teacher college students, who filled in a questionnaire measuring recollections of   (al Authority Questionnaire [PAQ]) and self-regulation in learning (Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire [MSLQ]). Unlike in  known about adolescents, authoritative  was not significantly associated with students'  self-regulation skills, except for human resources. Authoritarian  was the only   correlated with motivation, self-efficacy, and cognitive strategies and strongly correlated with critical thinking. These  suggest new ways of evaluating the relationship of authoritarian  with academic skills."
Emerging Adult Perceptions of and Preferences for Parenting Styles and Associated Psychological Outcomes,2018,"Research suggests that  perception of   may strongly influence  outcomes and s must balance support and structure based on their emerging adult 's changing needs. The current  examined emerging adult perceptions of   in comparison with their preferences and how these characteristics interact to predict psychological problems. Significant interactions between preferred and perceived   were found, several of which were further moderated by gender. Results suggest that emerging adults prefer   that grant autonomy, and males reported lower psychological problems when they  perceived such a  , whereas females reported higher psychological problems. This may suggest that females experience more risky behaviors while at college when granted autonomy relative to males, thus accounting for their higher psychological problems. The current  emphasizes the ongoing impact of al influences on emerging adult outcomes and that 's preferences and perceptions influence - gender dyads."
The effect of parenting styles on enforcement of oral health behaviours in ,2021,"Purpose To examine the relationship between   and al attitudes towards oral health practices in . Methods s of  aged 4-6 years ing to four public dental clinics completed the  Styles Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ) and a questionnaire on al attitudes,  diet and oral hygiene practices. Child oral health was evaluated using Plaque Index (PI) and dmft-Index. Results Three hundred and eighty-nine  (mean age: 62.3 +/- 9.8 months) were recruited. The median dmft was 4 (IQR = 9) and median PI was 1.5 (IQR = 0.8). An authoritative   was observed in 95.1% of s. Authoritative s were more likely to monitor sweets/snacks intake (P = 0.004) and less inclined to offer sweets/snacks in exchange for good behaviour (P = 0.04) than permissive s. However, actual between-meal snacking frequency did not differ between  (P = 0.43). Permissive s were less likely to ensure bedtime toothbrushing (P = 0.001) or brush thoroughly when busy or tired (P = 0.03) compared to authoritative s; these attitudes were associated with higher frequencies of actual omission of bedtime toothbrushing (P = 0.006) in their . A higher frequency of omitting bedtime toothbrushing significantly predicted a permissive   (OR = 12.1, P = 0.009).   were not associated with dmft (P = 0.72) and/or PI (P = 0.34). Conclusions Authoritative  was associated with positive attitudes regarding both preventive dietary and oral hygiene practices. Actual oral hygiene practices were more ideal in  with authoritative s, but   had no impact on actual dietary habits."
Intergenerational transmission of parenting style in rural China and the mediation effect of Caregiver's mental health,2020,"Background: The quality of  is associated with both early hood development and lifelong negative adult outcomes, and there is evidence to suggest that some aspects of  show patterns of intergenerational transmission. However, the mediating mechanisms of the intergenerational transmission of   are not fully understood. Aims: This  aims to examine whether intergenerational transmission of   occurs among caregivers in rural China, and whether the mental health of caregivers is a critical mediator in the transmission process across generations. Methods: The sample consists of 194 caregivers who were recruited from an investigation in rural Jiangxi Province, China.   of both father and mother of the caregiver were self-reported by the caregiver using the simplified version of Egna Minnen av Barndoms Uppfostran (s-EMBU) inventory. The current   of the caregiver is assessed by using the  Practice Questionnaire (PPQ). We use multivariate regression to predict the intergenerational transmission of   and examine the potential mediation effects. Results: We found that 'emotional warmth' and 'rejective'   of caregiver's s are positively and significantly associated with 'warm' and 'hostile'   of the caregiver, respectively. The transmission of rejective, hostile   across generation is fully mediated by the mental health status of the caregiver. Specifically, the mediation effect of caregiver's depression, anxiety, and stress are all statistically significant. Conclusions: Findings in this paper support the existence of intergenerational transmission of   in rural China. Caregiver's mental health mediate the transmission process of rejective, hostile  . This raises the possibility that  services may benefits across generations, and provides empirical evidence for preventive services aimed at improving caregiver's mental health and   at the early stage of  development."
Dog-directed parenting styles predict verbal and leash guidance in dog owners and owner-directed attention in dogs,2020,"Dog-directed  is an aspect of the owner-dog relationship that describes the overarching emotional sphere in which the dog's guidance and training take place. How dog-directed   express in specific owner-dog interactions is ly unknown. However, such knowledge can help to advise dog owners on appropriate  of their dog. Child-directed  is regarded appropriate when it is demanding for socially adaptive behaviour as well as responsive to the 's needs. This combination of high demandingness and responsiveness is known as authoritative , which in dog-directed  manifests in two ways. Teaching the dog socially adaptive behaviour is key to the authoritative-training  (AUT) and being responsive to the dog's perceived needs and emotions is key to the authoritative-intrinsic  (AUI). A third dog-directed  , the authoritarian-correction  (AUC), of high demandingness and low responsiveness focusses on correcting the dog's undesired behaviour. We determined these three dog-directed   by an online questionnaire and tested the  for associations with owner and dog behaviours. The behaviours were scored as the owner-dog dyads walked a short course with distractions (treats and balls) that dogs should ignore (N = 40) or when they had a ten-minute break together (N = 36). Nine out of 49 behavioural observations, such as verbally praising or correcting the dog and leash tensions, related significantly (comparison-wise two-tailed P < 0.05) to the   and Spearman rank correlations explained up to 30 % of the variance. The self-report-based dog-directed   related logically to the way owners actually interacted with their dogs, verbally and by leash. AUI and AUT  related directly to verbally praising the dog. AUC  related directly to verbally correcting the dog and to leash tensions. Also, AUC  related inversely and AUT  directly to the dog frequently looking at its owner during the course with distractions. Thus, we find evidence that verbal communication and leash tensions are telling about dog-directed   and, possibly, constitute meaningful manifestations to address in educational interventions for dog owners. We see potential merit in moving AUC  dog owners away from leash-related guidance towards verbal praise-based guidance and a more authoritative dog-directed  ."
Associations of parenting styles with moral reasoning in  and adolescents: A meta-analysis,,"The  meta-analysis integrates the  of studies on associations of   with moral reasoning. The systematic search in electronic databases identified 23 studies that were included in this random-effects meta-analysis. We found a statistically significant, but small positive, concurrent association of authoritative  with higher moral reasoning, while the reverse was found for authoritarian . No significant associations were found for permissive , and numbers of studies were too small for identifying significant associations of neglectful  with moral reasoning, as well as cross-lagged effects of   on longitudinal change in moral reasoning. The size of the associations varied, in part, by publication status, educational status, and quality of assessing moral reasoning. Implications for future  and practice are discussed."
Parenting style and dietary behaviour of young . Findings from the Healthy Beginnings Trial,2013,"  may have a role in the development of young 's dietary behaviour, and a better understanding of   may lead to better-targeted hood obesity prevention interventions. This  aimed to investigate the association of al self-efficacy,   and dietary behaviour of young . A cross-sectional  with 242 first-time mothers and their  was conducted using the data from the Healthy Beginnings Trial undertaken in one of the most socially and economically disadvantaged areas of south-western Sydney, in 2007-2010. al self-efficacy,   (warmth and hostility) and 's dietary behaviours (consumption of vegetables, fruit, soft-drink and snacks) were assessed by face-to-face interviews with participating mothers in the control group when their  were 2 years old. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the association between   and the 's dietary behaviour. Mothers with higher levels of global al self-efficacy and self-efficacy for an infant were more likely to report their  had 2 serves of vegetables per day, with odds ratio (OR) 2.40 (95%CI 1.35-4.27, P = 0.003) and OR 1.88 (95%CI 1.06-3.36, P= 0.03), respectively. A higher level of global al self-efficacy or self-efficacy for an infant was significantly associated with having 2 serves of fruit per day with adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.46 (95%CI 1.35-4.48, P= 0.003) and AOR 1.85 (95%CI 1.00-3.41, P= 0.048), respectively, after adjusting for annual household income. Mothers with a higher level of al warmth were more likely to report their  had 2 serves of vegetable per day with OR 1.85 (95%CI 1.06-3.25, P= 0.03). al self-efficacy and   were associated, cross-sectionally, with important 's dietary behaviours.

Young Children's Sleep Problems: The Impact of Parental Distress and Parenting Style,2019,"ObjectivesResearch examining factors contributing to preschool sleep problems is limited. This  investigated the mediating role of   (authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive ) in the relationship between al psychological distress and sleep problems in young .MethodsParticipants were s of 232 young  aged three to five years. s completed the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire, the  Style and Dimensions Questionnaire-Short Version, and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale.ResultsOnly permissive  was found to significantly mediate the relationship between al distress and preschool sleep problems (indirect effect=0.16, p<0.01), with a significant direct effect of al psychological distress on  sleep problems (0.16, p<0.01)  being . Authoritarian and authoritative  were found to be unrelated to  sleep problems.ConclusionsThese findings suggest that augmenting treatment programs for preschool sleep problems with strategies targeting al distress and permissive  where required, may be beneficial in improving preschool sleep problems."
Examination of Parenting Styles of Processing Emotions and Differentiation of Self,2006,"Gottman and associates theorized emotion coaching, s' processing of negative emotions with , as important for 's later development. Bowen viewed differentiation, the balance between emotional and cognitive reactions to one's family of origin, as an important developmental process. However,  has not specified  methods that foster healthy differentiation. The authors hypothesized adults with emotion-coaching s have healthier differentiation than those ed with other . A total of 254 (129 female, 124 male) participants completed surveys measuring perception of   and differentiation of self. For male participants, perceiving their s as having a disapproving  was associated with a poor sense of self. For female participants, high levels of fusion and low levels of emotional cutoff were associated with low emotion-coaching s and disapproving mothers. Implications and limitations are discussed."
"Influence of Parenting Style on Body Mass Index, Physical Activity, and Sedentary Time",2021,"The purpose of the current  was to determine the influence of   on body mass index (BMI) percentile, physical activity (PA), and sedentary time (ST) in . Accelerometers were used to assess PA and ST in 152 fifth-grade .   was assessed by the  participants' responses to modified questions from the  Style Inventory II and dichotomized as authoritative or non-authoritative. Multiple linear regression analyses were utilized to identify significant predictors of outcomes of interest.   did not predict ST or any intensity of PA; however, BMI percentile and gender were significant predictors of moderate-intensity PA, vigorous-intensity PA, and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (P < .01). BMI percentile was predicted to be lower in females with authoritative mothers (P < .01). While authoritative and non-authoritative   did not predict objectively measured PA or ST in early adolescents, authoritative   did predict BMI percentile in female participants."
"The Relationship Between Early Maladaptive Schemas, Parenting Styles And Psychological Symptoms And The Needs Threats",2017,"Objective: This  was designed to examine the relationship between early maladaptive schemas,  , psychological symptoms and the need threats in university students. Method: The sample of the  consisted of 133 undergraduate students ing at Hacettepe University. Aforementioned variables were assessed by Young Schema Questionnaire-Short Form 3, The Turkish versions of the Young  Inventory, Symptom Assesment Inventory, Need Threat Scale. Results: A series of regression analyses revealed that perceived paternal Conditional/Success-Oriented   predicted the decrease in self esteem. The Pessimistic/Anxious paternel   predicted the increase in self esteem. Extreme Permissive/Unlimited and Pessimistic/Anxious paternal   predicted the increase in the need of control. On the other hand paternal Punitive   predicted the decrease in perceived control. Analyzing the relationship between psychological symptoms and self-esteem,  showed that the increase in anxiety score predicted the increase in self esteem and phobic anxiety predicted the decrease in self esteem. Moreover, the decrease in self-esteem predicted by the increase in interpersonal sensitivity. Finally, analyses showed that there is no significant relationship between schema domains and basic need threats. Conclusion: In conclusion, findings pointed out the predictive power of early maladaptive schemas, perceived "
The Separation-Individuation and Perceived Parenting Styles in Adolescents,2010,"Problem Statement: An infantile that needs his/her caregiver's or mothers' care starts moving independently by controlling his/her body movements during development stages. Therefore, an infantile becomes aware of the fact the he/she is a different individual from his/her mother. In other words, he/she begins in individualize. However, this process is a complex one which consists of father and the interaction between mother and infant. Adolescence is the second period in which a quick development takes place in an individual's life. Adolescence is a period of identity formation. In this , the relationship between separation-individuation and perceived  dimensions in adolescents was analyzed since the characteristics of relationship between s and adolescents during the separation-individuation process are significant. Purpose of the Study: The purpose of the  is to explain the relationship between adolescents' separation-individuation and their perceived acceptance/involvement and strict control al dimensions. Method: The  group consisted of a total of 251 high school students, (126 female, 99 male) ing at 9(th), 10(th), and 11(th) grade levels. However, the date gathered from 26 students were disregarded due to incomplete and/or mistaken date. The analyses were carried out on a 225-person date set. The points which were obtained from the three scales were analyzed through SPSS 11.5 and the total points and the total points of scales were found in date analyses. Findings and Results: There was no difference between engulfment anxiety, rejection expectancy, and dependency denial subscales of SITA (the Separation-Individuation Test of Adolescene) according to geneder. There was no difference between  Styles Scale's acceptance/involvement and strict control dimensions according to gender. It was observed that there was a significant relationship between separation anxiety, rejection expectancy, and mother and father's strict control dimension. There was a positive relationship between practing-mirroring and mother's strict control dimension. There was a positive relationship between rejection expectancy and mother's acceptance/involvement dimension. There was a positive relationship between acceptance/involvement of mother-father and nurturance seeking. There was a positive relationship between nurturance seeking and father's strict control. Conclusions And Recommendations: At the end of the , it was observed that separation anxiety, healthy separation, nurturance seeking, and peer enmeshment subscales scores were significantly different in terms of gender. The  showed that the scores gained from  Styles Scale's acceptance/involvement and strict control dimensions were not significantly difference in terms of gender. Some separation-individuation problems of students can be prevented through doing studies to materialize their   and separation-individuation in the frame of the counseling."
The Relationship Between Parenting Styles and Moral Development of Preschool Children Mediated by Children's Attachment,2021,"Objective Family is like a school where s teach the lessons of humanity and morality, which are the foundation of human happiness, to their . Moral development is an essential part of 's understanding of moral rules and principles. The lack of moral development, along with anxiety, and depression exposes  to antisocial and suicidal behaviors. Moral development is associated with   and attachment. This  aims to investigate the relationship between   and moral development of preschool  mediated by 's attachment. Materials & Methods This descriptive correlational  was conducted on 128  (64 girls and 64 boys) selected from 8 preschools in Tehran Province, Iran, in 2020 using a cluster sampling technique. The  data were collected using three questionnaires: Baumrind  Styles Questionnaire (PSQ), the Kinship Center Attachment Questionnaire (KCAQ), and Lotfabadi Moral Development Questionnaire (MDQ). The first two tools were completed by mothers of , while the MDQ was completed by . The Kolmogorov-Simonov test, correlation test (Enter method), analysis of variance, and multiple regression analysis were used for data analysis in SPSS v. 21. Results The regression analysis  showed that   had a significant relationship with moral development (R=0.74, Adjusted R-2=0.54, P=0.000). Also, attachment had a significant association with moral development (R=0.71, Adjusted R-2=0.49, P=0.000). With one unit change in permissive, authoritarian, and authoritative  , the moral development of preschool  can be predicted by 43.5%, 19%, and 37.6%, respectively. Moreover, with one unit change in positive adjustment/development, negative behavior, emotional reactivity, and distancing from caregiver support dimensions of attachment, the moral development of preschool  can be predicted by 33.6%, 38.4%, -26.4%, and -11.4%, respectively. Also, the  of the Sobel test showed that the attachment variable was the mediator of the relationship of   with moral development (z=2.29>1.96). Conclusion The moral development of  is related to permissive, authoritarian, and authoritative  . Besides, 's attachment can mediate the relationship between   and moral development. More planning and follow-up are needed to improve the moral development of preschool . When s are consistent in their  , they provide their  with assertive and trusting behaviors. They should listen to their  and promote dialogue with them. Their discipline should be accompanied by warmness, logic, and flexibility and give their  the freedom to some extent. This treatment can help  develop their social behavior."
The Impact of Parenting Style on Children's Educational Outcomes in the United States,2016,"This paper examines the causal link between   and 's educational outcomes. The existing literature seems to lack any effort to use a nationally reative data from the United States, to properly address endogeneity, or to examine educational outcomes beyond high school level. This paper attempts to mitigate these shortcomings. Drawing upon the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, it first used OLS and logit regression. It then applied the maximum simulated likelihood approach to get rid of endogeneity, thereby isolating the causal impact of   on 's educational outcomes. Findings suggested that   mattered for  academic performance. Authoritative   was found to be the best among all types of  . Particularly, relative to uninvolved s' , authoritatively reared  were predicted to have 1.1 more years of schooling and be 18.5, 13.6, and 16.3 percentage points more likely to obtain at least bachelor's degree, associate's degree, and high school diploma, respectively. Also, they had 5.5 percentage points less likelihood of being high school dropouts than  reared by uninvolved s."
Predictive Power of Parenting Styles on Children's Social Skills: A Brazilian Sample,2016,"The aim of this  was to investigate the relationship between   and 's social skills, establishing significant correlations between those two constructs. A total of 202 , 7 to 10 years old, male and female, attending second to fourth year of government schools in SAo Paulo, Brazil, were participants of this . They collectively completed Children's Social Skills Test (THAS-C) and al Styles Inventory (IEP). Results suggest that positive al  are predictors of altruism, while negative al  are predictors of assertiveness, conversation, and social confidence. Regarding general social skills, variables that offered the best probable model were positive monitoring, lax discipline, moral behavior, and physical abuse (the higher the general social skill, the lesser the abusive  ). As a conclusion, it seems that different social skills are related to positive and negative  , reinforcing the idea of a social skill as an attribute of behavior."

Clinic-Referred Mothers' Autobiographical Narratives as Markers of Their Parenting Styles,2010,"Forty clinic-referred mothers completed questionnaires describing their 's problems and the mothers'  . In addition, each mother told three stories about their personal experiences in  care and one story about being cared for in their families of origin. Each story was transcribed and rated for coherence on six dimensions describing narrative clarity and richness. Results showed the narrative ratings to be fairly reliable and internally consistent, and the questionnaires proved to be psychometrically sound except for one of the   scales that we dropped from further data analyses. Results showed the two remaining scales (authoritative and authoritarian ) covaried with mothers' reports about problems with their . Correlations between mothers' narrative coherence scores and their   scores showed mixed : authoritative  was not correlated with narrative coherence, but authoritarian  was negatively correlated with this narrative measure. Regression analyses using the six coherence scales and the authoritarian  scale showed the causality scale to account for most of the variance in authoritarian . We speculated on the nature of this latter covariation."
Parenting Styles and Aggressive Adolescents: Relationships with Self-esteem and Personal Maladjustment,2020,"Current emergent studies are seriously questioning if al strictness contributes to adolescent adjustment. This  examined whether the relationship between authoritative (warmth and strictness), authoritarian (strictness without warmth), indulgent (warmth without strictness), and neglectful (neither warmth nor strictness)   shows equal or different pattern of adjustment and maladjustment for aggressive and non-aggressive adolescents. The sample consisted of 969 Spanish adolescents, 554 females (57.2%) and 415 males, ranging from 12 to 17 years old. Families were classified into one of four typologies by their scores on warmth and strictness, and the adolescents were grouped by their aggressiveness (low vs. high). Adolescent adjustment was captured with three self-esteem indicators (emotional, physical, and family) and personal maladjustment with five indicators (negative self-esteem, negative self-adequacy, emotional irresponsiveness, emotional instability, and negative worldview). It was tested main and interaction effects between  and aggressiveness considering  sex and age factors. Findings showed that aggressive adolescents always had the worst socialization outcomes (i.e., the lowest self-esteem and the highest personal maladjustment). Aggressive and non-aggressive adolescents have a common pattern: both, indulgent and authoritative   were always associated with better outcomes than either authoritarian or neglectful , but indulgent   was associated with the best outcomes across all the criteria. In contrast with previous evidence about the idea that al strictness and imposition might be beneficial to raise aggressive adolescents,  findings highlight the positive impact of al warmth even with aggressive adolescents. Implications for family interventions were considered."
Parenting styles and career decision-making among French and Korean adolescents,2014,"This  compared the relationship of   to the career decision-making of adolescents from a Western and an Eastern context. Specifically, 575 French high school students and 613 South Korean high school students completed a questionnaire assessing perceived  , career decision-making difficulties, and career decision self-efficacy. The Korean adolescents had lower career decision self-efficacy beliefs and higher career decision-making difficulties than the French adolescents. The authoritarian   was associated with higher scores on career decision self-efficacy and lower scores on a measure of career decision-making difficulties in the Korean sample while the authoritative   was associated with higher scores on career decision self-efficacy and lower scores on a measure of career decision-making difficulties in the French sample. Results showed significant effects for gender and   on the career decision-making outcomes of both samples. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

The aim of the   was to determine whether  was a moderator of the relationship between overweight and psychological outcomes in . Methods: Participants were  aged 7-11 years and their primary caregivers (n = 158), recruited from primary schools across South Australia. Children completed measures of  , self-esteem, and body dissatisfaction, and had their weight and height objectively measured. s completed measures of body dissatisfaction and depressive symptoms, and reported on their education. Regression analyses investigated associations between perceived  ,  weight, and outcomes of  selfesteem and body image. Results: Larger  body mass index (BMI) was negatively associated with  self-esteem and positively associated with  body dissatisfaction. al responsiveness was positively associated with  self-esteem, but  was not associated with  body dissatisfaction. Child weight and   were not found to interact in their association with  outcomes. Conclusions: Higher  BMIwas associated with higher body dissatisfaction and lower self-esteem in a young, non-treatment-seeking sample.

The Impacts of Parenting Style and Perceived Childhood Attachment on Children's Concept of God,2019,"Background: Children are first educated in their families. s by adapting different   consciously and in most cases unconsciously teach their  important educational doctrines. Objectives: This  aimed to determine the impacts of   and perceived hood attachment on 's concept of God. In this descriptive correlational , 375 students of Islamic Azad university of Birjand were selected via multi-stage sampling. Materials and Methods: The subjects completed the questionnaires related to  , perceived al attachment, and concept of God. The obtained model was a good fit for the data, and the psychological pattern revealed that controlling   (insecure mother- attachment) promotes dependence on God and encourages the perception of God as a controller. Also, supportive  via forming - attachments (insecure father- attachment) could predict the 's view of God as a controller. Results: Good   was not directly correlated with the perception of God; however, it could improve one's positive perception of God through increasing or decreasing attachment to s. In addition, poor and rejecting   both directly and indirectly affects the concept of God by increasing 's mistrust toward s and decreasing dependence on God. Conclusions: Uncaring, rejecting   is more remarkable in decreasing positive attitudes toward God, compared to authoritative  ."
The Contributions of Indigenous Personality and Parenting Style to Life Satisfaction Development in Chinese Adolescents,2021,"The  three-wave longitudinal  examined the contributions of indigenous personality traits and   to life satisfaction in Chinese adolescents. Seven hundred and ten junior high school students (M-age = 11.39, SDage = 0.53; 53.2% girls) were administered self-report measures of personality,  , and life satisfaction in Grade 6. Data on life satisfaction were collected again in Grades 7 and 8, respectively. Latent growth model analyses indicated that life satisfaction decreased over time. Regression analyses showed that the initial level of global life satisfaction was positively predicted by personality factors of dependability and interpersonal relatedness; the slope of global life satisfaction was positively predicted by personality factors of emotional stability whereas negatively predicted by interpersonal relatedness. The initial levels and slopes of different domains of life satisfaction were predicted by personality factors and   to different extents. Meanwhile, paternal and maternal   had different effects on adolescents' life satisfaction. The  provided valuable information about the contributions of indigenous personality and both paternal and maternal   to psychological adjustment in the Chinese context. The implications of the findings concerning the associations among personality,  , and life satisfaction were discussed."

They were then given threat. positive or no verbal information about three novel animals before being asked to place their hands ill boxes they believed these animals inhabited. Their average heart rate during the approach was recorded. The  suggest that a neglectful maternal   mediates the effect that verbal threat information has on physiological responses. However, a punitive maternal  , maternal warmth, overprotection, and accurate monitoring were not found to have a significant effect. Paternal   were not found to have any significant effect. This experiment adds to the existing evidence demonstrating that  practices can mediate components of acquired anxiety emotions."

Psychometric Properties of the Maternal and Paternal Parenting Styles Scale in Chilean Adolescents,2021,"  has been related to a series of positive outcomes that extend into adulthood. The aim of this  was to analyze the psychometric properties of the maternal and paternal   scale (PSS-MP) in a sample of adolescents. A cross-sectional design was used, with a probability sample of 2683 adolescents (48.8% women) from 32 public, private, and subsidized schools in Chile. In total, four confirmatory factor models were contrasted, which was the best fit to support the originally proposed six-correlated factor structure. The factor invariance analysis reflected that the metric equivalence according to sex is  at the level of scale invariance. It is concluded that the abbreviated version of the PSS-MP provides sufficient evidence for use in the Chilean adolescent population."
Relationships in transition: maternal and paternal parenting styles and change in sibling dynamics during adolescence,2022,"Objective: The goal of the current 3-year longitudinal  was to evaluate the association between maternal and paternal   and sibling relationships during the early to late adolescent transition. Our original sample consisted of 272 particpants in grades 9 and 11 from a high school in the Northeastern US. After three years, time 2 data for 135 students from the original sample was collected. The  behaviour assessed was  . Sibling relationship outcomes were sibling support, warmth, and conflict. Maternal authoritative and permissive  were associated with greater time II sibling support than maternal authoritarian and neglectful . Maternal authoritative  was further associated with greater time II sibling warmth than the authoritarian and neglectful . Paternal authoritative  was associated with greater time II sibling support than the authoritarian and neglectful . Additionally, although overall  with low levels of acceptance and involvement was associated with reduced sibling relationship quality, paternal neglectful   was associated with greater increases over time in sibling support than the other paternal  . Cohort effects were  found for sibling support and conflict. The  highlight the continuous contribution  behaviours have on sibling relationship quality during adolescence. The findings point to potential compensatory support offered by siblings in early and late adolescence."

Multi-stage cluster sampling was used to collect a reative sample of 751 middle school students in an eastern province of China. The  indicated a positive relationship between the intensity of adolescents' mobile phone use and -adolescent conflict about mobile phone use. al demandingness was related to more conflict, whereas al responsiveness was related to less conflict. Moreover, moderation analyses revealed that the relationship between the intensity of adolescents' mobile phone use and -adolescent conflict varied based upon the degree of al demandingness and al responsiveness. Theoretically, this  contributes to the literature on associations between   and -adolescent conflict. Findings from this  provide s with knowledge to reduce conflict with their  regarding mobile phone use."
When parents are inconsistent: Parenting style and adolescents' involvement in cyberbullying,2019,"Introduction The prevalence of cyberbullying among adolescents is globally on the rise. This  examined how general and cyber-specific   impact the prevalence of young adolescents' involvement in cyberbullying as victims and/or perpetrators. Methods: One hundred and eighty 7th and 8th-grade Israeli students participated (Mean age = 13.25, SD = 0.81; 86 males, 89 females, 5 did not indicate gender). Adolescents reported the frequency of their involvement in cyberbullying, and whether their s were using autonomy-supportive or psychologically controlling strategies generally and specifically when mediating internet use. Results: A controlling - as well as an inconsistent internet-mediation  were associated with a higher prevalence of adolescent involvement in cyberbullying as victims and as perpetrators. Prevalence was higher when s who generally use a controlling  were less controlling or consistent when mediating internet use. Conclusion: Despite the caveats related to al control, s who generally use a controlling  should consistently use this  while mediating cyber. Inconsistent   conveys messages concerning internet activities that contradict what teens are accustomed to receiving in other contexts. This inconsistency may encourage them to exploit their relative freedom in the cyber context and act irresponsibly."
The influence of paternal and maternal parenting styles on adolescents' regulatory focus: A longitudinal study,,"To strengthen the evidence for the developmental assumption of regulatory focus theory, that individuals' chronic self-regulatory orientations root in  behaviors, the   investigated the influences of maternal and paternal   on Chinese adolescents' regulatory focus and the effects of regulatory focus on mental health using an 8-month longitudinal design. 466 Chinese middle and high school students completed the regulatory focus, perceived maternal and paternal  , life satisfaction, and positive and negative social adjustment measures. The  showed that: (1) Adolescents' promotion focus positively predicted life satisfaction and positive social adjustment and negatively predicted negative social adjustment. Prevention focus positively predicted negative social adjustment. (2) Maternal emotional warmth positively predicted promotion focus, whereas paternal harsh discipline positively predicted prevention focus. (3) Promotion focus mediated the relationship between maternal emotional warmth and life satisfaction and positive and negative social adjustment. Prevention focus mediated the relationship between paternal harsh discipline and negative social adjustment."
Family Impact and Parenting Styles in Families of Children with ADHD,2017,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) begins in hood and is characterized by attention deficits, hyperactivity, or impulsiveness that is inconsistent with a 's developmental level.

Perceptions of Parenting Styles and Their Associations with Mental Health and Life Satisfaction Among Urban Indonesian Adolescents,2015,"The  aimed at investigating the association between maternal and paternal   and psychological well-being among Indonesian adolescents. The al Authority Questionnaire (PAQ), General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12), and the Brief Multidimensional Students' Life Satisfaction Scale, were administered to 500 adolescents. We were unable to replicate the three-factor solution of the PAQ using confirmatory factor analysis. The permissive subscale demonstrated poor psychometric properties; it was therefore not included in any further analysis. Mothers were perceived to be more authoritative than fathers; on the other hand, fathers were perceived to be more authoritarian than mothers. Both maternal and paternal authoritative   were positively associated with outcomes. Authoritarian  was not associated with any outcome. Scores computed to re perceived differences between maternal and paternal use of various   were associated with reported GHQ-12 and life satisfaction scores. Our  confirm Western findings on the positive effects of authoritative , but do not replicate the negative associations of authoritarian . Future studies that examine different   at the construct level are needed to elucidate the association between   and adolescent psychological functioning in the Indonesian and other similar contexts."
School Competence among Adolescents in Low-Income Families: Does Parenting Style Matter?,2018,"In the  , we investigated   and self-perceived school competence among low-income adolescents in Norway. The purpose of the  was threefold: (1) to identify differences, if any, in self-perceived school competence between low-income ethnic Norwegians and low-income ethnic minorities; (2) to determine differences, if any, in the perception of   between the groups; and (3) to determine if   predict self-perceived school competence in the two groups. The sample consisted of 253 adolescents 12-18 years of age; 130 adolescents were ethnic Norwegians, and 123 were from ethnic minorities. Self-perceived school competence was measured using the Scholastic Competence subscale of Harter's Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents. Perception of   was measured with the following three scales: support, monitoring and neglect. An independent-samples t-test revealed that ethnic minorities reported higher levels of self-perceived school competence than did ethnic Norwegians. No significant difference between the groups in their perception of   was observed. Support and monitoring were positively correlated with school competence, whereas neglect was negatively correlated with school competence. When all three   were entered separately into standard multiple regression analyses for the two groups, a high degree of perceived neglect significantly predicted low self-perceived school competence in both groups. This finding indicates how schools and policy makers can explore the types of support that families may need to adopt better upbringing ."
Relationship Between Perceived Parenting Styles and Identity Styles With Intensity of Depression in Adolescents,2017,"Objectives The aim of this  was to examine the relationship between identity  and dimensions of perceived  with the intensity of depression in adolescents. Methods In a correlation design, 200 (100 girls and 100 boys) students aged 14-18 years were selected from Tehran high schools using cluster sampling. Participants were asked to complete Beck Depression Inventory-2 (BDI-2),  Style Questionnaire (PSQ) and Identity Styles Inventory (ISI) questionnaires. Data were analyzed using Pearson correlation and step-by-step regression (stepwise). Results Significant relationship was found to exist among the dimensions of perceived  and identity  along with depressive intensity. Additionally, predictor variables including identity commitment, dimensions of acceptance, and control  with correlation (r=0.50) could predict 0.25 percent of depressive intensity among adolescents (R-2=0.52). Conclusions It seems that identity commitment and   based on  acceptance among adolescents are two important variables in preventing depressive symptoms.   and adolescent  communication are acceptable skills. In addition, the pathology ing from depression among the adolescents was high, so it is important to address this problem practically."
"An investigation of maternal personality, parenting styles, and subjective well-being",2008,"The goal of the   was to explore how al BIS/BAS relates to  , and to investigate if subjective well-being (SWB) moderates these associations. Mothers (n = 95) were asked to complete measures of personality,  , and life satisfaction (SWB). Results revealed that mothers who reported high BAS were significantly more likely to report being nurturing and were either more likely to be authoritative (high nurture and high control) or neglectful (low nurture and low control). Subsequent analyses revealed that mothers high in both BAS and SWB were significantly more likely to be authoritative, whereas mothers high in BAS and low in SWB were significantly more likely to be neglectful. Results suggest the value of considering personality in  . (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Associations Between Parenting Styles and Teen Driving, Safety-Related Behaviors and Attitudes",2009,"OBJECTIVE: The goal was to explore the association between   and driving behaviors. METHODS: The 2006 National Young Driver Survey gathered data on driving safety behaviors from a nationally reative sample of 5665 ninth-, 10th-, and 11th-graders. A   variable was based on adolescent reports and separated s into 4 groups, (1) authoritative (high support and high rules/monitoring), (2) authoritarian (low support and high rules/monitoring), (3) permissive (high support and low rules/monitoring), and (4) uninvolved (low support and low rules/monitoring). Associations between   and driving behaviors and attitudes were assessed. RESULTS: One half of s were described as authoritative, 23% as permissive, 8% as authoritarian, and 19% as uninvolved. Compared with teens with uninvolved s, those with authoritative s reported one half the crash risk in the past year (odds ratio [OR]: 0.47 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26-0.87]), were 71% less likely to drive when intoxicated (OR: 0.29 [95% CI: 0.19-0.44]), and were less likely to use a cellular telephone while driving (OR: 0.71 [95% CI: 0.50-0.99]). Teens with authoritative or authoritarian s reported using seat belts nearly twice as often (authoritative: OR: 1.94 [95% CI: 1.49-2.54]; authoritarian: OR: 1.85 [95% CI: 1.08-3.18]) and speeding one half as often (authoritative: OR: 0.47 [95% CI: 0.36-0.61]; authoritarian: OR: 0.63 [95% CI: 0.40-0.99]) as teens with uninvolved s. No significant differences in crash risk or seat belt use were found between permissive and uninvolved s. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should encourage s to set rules and to monitor teens' driving behaviors, in a supportive context. Pediatrics 2009; 124: 1040-1051"

This relationship was examined using two large sets of national data that were collected from school and university students to see how the relationship between   and academic efficacy beliefs may or may not vary across life stages. The sample included 1431 school students and 1119 university students cross the Sultanate of Oman. The participants responded to the Arabic version of the al Authority Questionnaire (PAQ) and to the Academic Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES) constructed by the ers. Using linear regression model for each sample, the  showed that the amount of variance in school students' academic self-efficacy beliefs explained by   (R(2)adjusted = 0.21) was higher than the amount of variance explained for the university sample (R(2)adjusted = 0.10). The ers concluded that the effects of   on students' self-efficacy beliefs decrease as  grow up."
"Relationships between parenting style, feeding style and feeding practices and fruit and vegetable consumption in early hood",2011,"Despite substantial evidence suggesting that a diet high in fruit and vegetables (FV) is associated with reduced risk of cancer, only 21% of  in the UK consume the recommended 5 portions of fruit or vegetables a day. This review examines the role of  , feeding  and feeding practices in FV consumption in early hood. Whilst inconsistencies in concepts and terminology cloud this literature, overall the evidence suggests that the context of an authoritative  and feeding  is associated with better FV consumption in the hood years. This context is typified by emotional warmth but high expectations for 's dietary adequacy and behaviour, accompanied by specific feeding practices such as modeling consumption of FV, making FV available within the home, covertly restricting unhealthy alternative snack foods, and encouraging  to try FV. Further longitudinal and intervention studies are required to determine the efficacy of modification of   and feeding practice on 's FV intake. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Profiles of maternal and paternal parenting styles in Chinese families: Relations to preschoolers' psychological adjustment,2021,"Despite the extensive  on   in Chinese families, few ers examined the similarities and differences between maternal and paternal   in Chinese families. The   used a person-centered approach to examine the profiles of maternal and paternal   in a sample of urban Chinese families with preschool-aged  (N = 2776, age = 31-82 months, 52.7% boys), and examined the relations between   profiles and 's psychological adjustment. Results showed that mothers reported slightly higher authoritative  than fathers. Cluster analysis revealed four profiles of maternal and paternal  : Authoritative Mother and Father (47.25%), Authoritative Father and Authoritarian Mother (15.41%), Authoritative Mother and Authoritarian Father (17.33%), Authoritarian Mother and Father (20.01%).

The relationship between parenting styles and peace attitudes,2020,"Purpose Taking into account previous literature on the role that the   to which individuals are exposed to during hood have in shaping prosocial behaviors and attitudes, this  aims to investigate the relationship between   of s and peace attitudes. Design/methodology/approach The peace attitude and the   questionnaires were completed by 358 adolescent and adult participants. Pearson correlation coefficients were extracted and a stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed. Findings The  indicate that individuals with authoritative s tend to show stronger peace attitudes and open the way to further  what al characteristics may be responsible for the development of peace attitudes in individuals. Research limitations/implications Participants retrospectively assessed their s' . Future  may recruit both the actual s of participants to collect more accurate data on  practices or use observational methods. Social implications This work seems to suggest that to achieve a more peaceful society, the ability of s to raise their  by adopting an authoritative  should be taken into account and - if needed - enhanced. Understanding the developmental pathways that can influence individuals to consistently choose peace is important to promote a stable culture of peace across several levels of observation.

Recollections of parenting styles in the development of narcissism: The role of gender,2020,"Narcissism in females is under-theorized in the literature due to a predominant focus on grandiose features indicative of the male gender. This  aimed to investigate recalled   in the development of grandiose and vulnerable narcissism to enhance theoretical knowledge regarding gender differences in the personality construct. Based on previous , it was hypothesized that strict  by the father would predict grandiose narcissism in males, and cold  by the mother would predict vulnerable narcissism in females. Participants (N = 328; 176 females) recruited from the normal population completed scales for grandiose and vulnerable narcissism, and perceived  . Results showed that females scored significantly higher on vulnerable narcissism than males, but no gender differences were found for grandiose narcissism. Findings linked retrospective reports of paternal overprotectiveness as a significant positive predictor of both grandiose and vulnerable narcissism in males; for females, recollections of maternal warmth significantly negatively predicted unique variance in vulnerable narcissism. Findings suggest that the interplay between al  and  gender may be associated with different manifestations of narcissism in males and females. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed and suggestions for future  made."

Perceived parenting dimensions and identity styles: Exploring the socialization of adolescents' processing of identity-relevant information,2008,"This  examined the relationships between crucial dimensions of perceived  (support, behavioral control, and psychological control) and the three identity  defined by Berzonsky [Berzonsky, M. D. (1990). Self-construction over the life span: A process perspective on identity formation. Advances in Personal Construct Psychology, 1, 155-186.]. Each identity  was hypothesized to relate to a specific pattern of perceived  dimensions. Hypotheses were examined in a sample of middle and late adolescents (n = 674). An information-oriented  was positively predicted by al support. Contrary to expectations, however, an information-oriented  was  positively predicted by psychological control. A normative identity  was positively predicted by support and behavioral control. In line with expectations, a diffuse-avoidant identity  was positively predicted by psychological control and negatively by maternal (but not paternal) behavioral control. Findings are discussed in light of the literature on the socialization of identity formation and directions for future  are outlined.

Influence of Parenting Style on the Academic Performance of Middle School Students,2014,"On the last few years the initiatives to reduce school failure in Spain are not giving the expected , as shown by several indicators. The educational system is leaving behind approximately one third of the students: they repeat the year, they are placed in homogeneous groups, etc., and however their performance at school is not improving. Therefore the classic ways to fight school failure are not producing good . The aim of this  is to explore the relationship between the   perceived by adolescences and their academic performance in Secondary School. We have focused on the two dimensions of   (acceptation/implication and coercion/imposition) instead of focusing on the four educational  that  from the intersection of the dimension. Our purpose is to identify and justify the family as a new field of psicopedagogical concern in order to explain the school failure of teenagers and to effectively intervene on it. The  show that 's acceptation/implication is significantly linked to academic performance."

Structural equation modelling revealed that the association between SES and 's problem behaviours was partially mediated by   and psychological suzhi. Moreover, the chain-mediated effect of authoritative  and suzhi was significant, while authoritarian  was not. Strategies that help s provide authoritative  practice and those that help  develop psychological suzhi may help reduce 's problem behaviours."
Are parenting style and controlling feeding practices related?,2008,"This  examined the relationships between  , feeding practices and BMI in a non-clinical sample of mothers and fathers of UK preschool . Ninety-six cohabiting s of 48  (19 male, 29 female, mean age 42 months) completed a series of self-report questionnaires assessing  , feeding practices, eating psychopathology and a range of demographic information. There were no relationships between authoritarian  and controlling feeding practices. In both mothers and fathers, permissive   was related to lower monitoring of 's unhealthy food intake. Permissive  was  associated with increased use of restriction by mothers and pressure to eat by fathers. Authoritative   was  related to lower use of pressure to eat by fathers only.   were not related to  BMI in this sample. Higher  BMI was best predicted by lower paternal application of pressure to cat and greater paternal reports of drive for thinness.   may not have a direct impact on  BMI until  food selection and Consumption becomes more autonomous.

Maternal Parenting Styles and Glycemic Control in Children with Type 1 Diabetes,2019,"The purpose of this  is to examine differences in   between mothers of  with type 1 diabetes and mothers of healthy  and to explore relationships between   and glycemic control of  with diabetes. Mothers of 63  with diabetes and mothers of 83  without diabetes reported their   using the Blocks' Child Rearing Practices Report, when their  was 9-10 years old. Glycemic control of the  with diabetes was evaluated 1 year after diagnosis (<6 years of age) and at the time of the  (at 9-10 years). Mothers of  with diabetes used more psychological control than mothers of healthy . Among girls with diabetes, poorer early glycemic control was associated with mothers' subsequent greater use of psychological control. Behavioral control was positively associated with poorer current glycemic control. In boys, psychological control was positively associated with poorer current glycemic control. Psychological control in families with diabetes needs attention, because it has shown to be associated with poorer diabetes care."

A survey was administered to 395 university students in Hong Kong on their perceptions about their s'  practices, filial piety beliefs, and life satisfaction. The  suggest that perceived authoritative  is associated with reciprocal filial piety and contributes positively to the young adults' life satisfaction. Both perceived authoritative and authoritarian  were associated with authoritarian filial piety, but authoritarian filial piety was not associated with young adults' life satisfaction. Due to the familial interdependence emphasized in the Chinese cultural context, Chinese adolescents' filial beliefs are related to the  they have experienced, and these beliefs may be associated with their psychosocial outcomes."

The parenting styles of divorced fathers and their predictors,2015,"Research on paternal  after divorce indicated that  benefit from authoritative . Fathers are not equally likely to be authoritative. Research on differences in divorced fathers'   remains underdeveloped. We sought to address this gap, investigating the predictors of paternal   following divorce. First, latent class analysis was utilized to derive   for divorced fathers. Second, predictors of these  were investigated with multinomial logistic regression. Analyses examined Belgian data on 404  (49.01% girls) and their s. Results reveal that important predictors include not only father and  characteristics but  mother characteristics and divorce-related characteristics. The findings therefore lend support to the idea of ing paternal  following divorce within a multilateral family framework."
"Relationship between permissive parenting style and atypical behaviour in preschool , with generalized anxiety as mediator",,"This  examines the relationship between permissive   and atypical behaviour in preschool , focusing on the mediating role of generalized anxiety.

The psychometric tests used were:  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire - Mother Form, Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition, Teacher Rating Scale, and Preschool Anxiety Scale -  version. Children whose s have a permissive   exhibit a high level of atypical behaviour, and a very high level of generalized anxiety. Generalized anxiety adds significant explanatory variance for atypical behaviour in preschool  over and above permissive  . Generalized anxiety has a partial mediating effect on the relationship between father's permissive   and atypical behaviour and a total mediating effect on the relationship between mother's permissive   and atypical behaviour."
Role of Parenting Style and Parents' Education in Positive Youth Development of Adolescents,2016,"The main purpose of this  is to determine the role of   and educational level of s in Positive Youth Development (PYD). Data were obtained using a questionnaire method involving 496 adolescent students of national secondary schools in Selangor. The findings indicate that there is a significant difference between the means for different races in PYD. This   revealed that authoritative  , uninvolved  , and fathers' level of education are significantly correlated to PYD. The authoritative   was found to be the most significant predictor of higher PYD. These findings suggest that adolescents with authoritative s in Malaysia show higher PYD and accordingly, they contribute to self, others and community."

Using a clinical sample, this  examined the relationship between early experiences with low care, increased control, abuse and neglect, and symptoms of anxiety and depression, via the mediating effects of cognitive . It was found that individuals who rate their s as being more abusive and neglectful reported a greater degree of depression and that this relationship was mediated by dysfunctional cognitive .

Correlation of parenting style and pediatric behavior guidance strategies in the dental setting: preliminary findings,2008,"Objective . The aim of this  was to investigate the influence of   on the choice of proper behavior guidance strategies in pedodontics. Material and methods . Seventy-two  aged between 4 and 6 years (mean 5.12 years) with carious primary mandibular molars were selected. The Primary Caregivers' Practices Report (PCPR) was used to quantify authoritarian, permissive and authoritative aspects of the caregivers'  . After inferior alveolar nerve block, carious lesions were removed and the teeth were restored using amalgam. The 's behavior during operation was assessed according to the sound, eye, and motor (SEM) scale. Communicative guidance, advance behavior guidance, al separation, and deferred treatment were used for behavior management. Results . The dominant authoritative score was observed in 50% of s, permissive in 37.5%, and authoritarian in 12.5%. The mean SEM score in  belonging to authoritative s was significantly lower than in  of permissive and of authoritarian s (p < 0.05). Communicative guidance was necessary for all patients regardless of  . Advanced behavior guidance (protective stabilization) was applied in 16.7% of cases in the authoritative category and in 100% in the permissive and authoritarian categories. The use of restrictive devices (7.4%) and sedation (3.7%) was limited to the permissive category. al separation (40.7%) and deferred treatment (3.7%) were performed only in the permissive category. Conclusions . This  provides preliminary evidence that a 's reaction to restorative dental procedures is influenced by the nature of the caregiver's  ."
Intergenerational Transmission of Emotion Dysregulation: The Role of Authoritarian Parenting Style and Family Chronic Stress,2019,"Objectives Although studies support a direct association between  and  emotion regulation, little work has considered potential mechanisms, such as family context. For example, s who have difficulty regulating their emotions may be more likely to adopt an authoritarian  , especially under high family chronic stress, and this   may then influence 's development of emotion regulation. The current  examined authoritarian   as a potential mechanism of the intergenerational transmission of emotion regulation. We  examined how maternal emotion regulation and family chronic stress interact to influence  behaviors. Methods A total of 218 mother-adolescent dyads (M age = 15.5 years, 55% female) were recruited from the community and assessed using a mix of self-report measures of emotion dysregulation and  , and interview-based measures of family chronic stress. Results Results showed maternal emotion dysregulation predicted authoritarian   that, in turn, predicted adolescent emotion dysregulation, with a significant indirect effect. Family chronic stress strengthened the association between maternal emotion dysregulation and authoritarian  , such that the indirect effect of maternal emotion regulation on adolescent emotion regulation via authoritarian   was stronger at high levels of chronic stress. Conclusions Results suggest that authoritarian   and family chronic stress serve as important factors in the intergenerational transmission of emotion regulation."
Identity status and perceived parenting style in adolescents living in central South Africa,2016,"This  investigated the relationship between black South African adolescents' identity statuses and their perceived  . Participants (n = 188; 66% = females) were from central South Africa. They completed the Objective Measure of Ego Identity Status and the al Authority Questionnaire in addition to a biographic survey that included questions on their family structures (nuclear, extended, other types). Findings suggest that diffused and achieved identity statuses relate to perceived authoritative and permissive   respectively. Results bring into question the universality of Western identity development and   theories."
Child's Difficult Temperament and Mothers' Parenting Styles,2014,"The  examined the associations between 's temperamental characteristics and mothers'  , and the mediating and moderating role of maternal well-being in these associations. Mothers of 152 Finnish first grade  (79 girls and 73 boys) filled in questionnaires measuring their   (i.e., affection, behavioral control, and psychological control) and psychological well-being (i.e., depressive symptoms and self-esteem), and their 's temperament. The  showed that 's low positivity was associated with low maternal affection, whereas 's negative emotionality was associated with mothers' high controlling attempts in terms of psychological and behavioral control. The impacts of 's low levels of positivity and high levels of activity on mothers' psychological control were mediated via maternal well-being: the more active and the less positive a mother perceived her  to be, the lower was her well-being and, consequently, the more psychological control she applied. Moderating effects of psychological well-being were not found."

Parenting style and -feeding behaviour in predicting 's weight status change in Taiwan,2014,"Objective The prevalence of overweight and obesity among  is on the rise worldwide. Prior studies find that s' -feeding practices are associated with  weight status and the efficacy of specific al -feeding practices can be moderated by  . In the current longitudinal , we examined the associations between -feeding practices and weight status changes over 1 year among a sample of school-aged  in Taiwan. Design In autumn 2008, a -feeding questionnaire and - questionnaire were administered to s of the second and fourth graders in an elementary school in Taiwan. The weight and height of the students were measured by a trained school nurse in 2008 and again in 2009. Setting An elementary school in central Taiwan. Subjects A total of 465 - pairs were included in the analysis. Results Using a gender- and age-adjusted BMI classification scheme issued by the Taiwan Department of Health, 29 center dot 2 % of the students were considered overweight at the 2009 measurement. Controlling for 2008 weight status revealed moderating effects of   on the relationship between -feeding practices and  weight status. Both authoritative and authoritarian mothers might monitor their 's dietary intake; however, the effectiveness of this practice was better, in terms of weight status control, among the authoritative mothers. Conclusions Findings suggest that   have a moderating effect on specific al -feeding practices.   and 's feeding practices could be an important focus for future public health interventions addressing the rising hood obesity epidemic."
Effects of Parenting Styles on Self-Regulated Learning and Academic Stress in Spanish Adolescents,2019,"Research has repeatedly highlighted the important influence of al socialization  on 's psychosocial adjustment. However, previous studies about their effects on school adjustment have traditionally addressed a limited set of indicators, such as academic achievement or self-concept, which should be broadened in order to increase our level of knowledge about this topic. Thus, the aim of the   was to analyze the relationships between   and other relevant school adjustment criteria (self-regulated learning and academic stress) in adolescence. The  participants were 437 Spanish adolescents (44.7% men) from 12 to 18 years old (M = 14.55, SD = 1.80) who were enrolled in high school. A multivariate factorial design ( x sex x educational level) was used for each set of criteria. The  are consistent with previous , showing that the indulgent  was related to better school adjustment during adolescence, evaluated through self-regulated learning and academic stress, thus increasing the available evidence about the influence of   in this setting. Additionally, this relationship remains invariant with regard to sex and the educational level of the participants in the . Therefore, this  highlights the importance of  practices related to high acceptance/involvement for the adequate school adjustment of Spanish adolescents."
Maternal parenting style and adjustment in adolescents with type I diabetes,2007,"Objective To investigate the cross-sectional relationship between maternal   and indicators of well-being among adolescents with diabetes. Methods Seventy-eight adolescents (ages 11.58-17.42 years, M = 14.21) with type 1 diabetes and their mothers separately reported perceptions of maternal  . Adolescents reported their own depressed mood, self-efficacy for managing diabetes, and diabetes regimen adherence. Results Adolescents perceptions of maternal psychological control were associated with greater depressed mood regardless of age and gender. Firm control was strongly associated with greater depressed mood and poorer self-efficacy among older adolescents, less strongly among younger adolescents. Adolescents perceptions of maternal acceptance were associated with less depressed mood, particularly for girls and with better self-efficacy for diabetes management, particularly for older adolescents and girls. Maternal reports of acceptance were associated only with adherence. Conclusions Maternal   is associated with well-being in adolescents with diabetes, but this association is complex and moderated by age and gender."
The relationships between the mental health of elementary school students and the practices and parenting styles,2015,"Objectives: This  aimed to relate to 's mental health of school  of the first cycle of basic education with  practices and  of those responsible. Methods: This  included a total of 321 first-to fifth-grade  and their s or guardians. The measurement instruments used for data collection were the strengths and difficulties questionnaire, the   inventory and the activities of daily life questionnaire. Correlation analyses and comparative analyses were performed. Results: The  indicated significant correlations between  practices and  mental health. This   suggested that in families where boundaries, rules and roles were established, including shared responsibilities, they have been shown to be associated with higher rates of  pro-social behavior, indicating protective factors for the mental health outcomes of . Conclusions: The  revealed that there are links between  mental health, and the  practices and  adopted by those responsible in order that the more positive practices, the fewer difficulties in mental health  . It is believed that the  may contribute towards subsidizing relevant issues to be considered by public policies of  mental health."
Behavioral problems and parenting style among Taiwanese  with autism and their siblings,2010,"Aims: The purpose of the   was to investigate the behavioral problems and   among  with autism and their siblings in an ethnic Chinese population. Methods: A total of 151  with DSM-IV autistic disorder, aged 3-12, 134 siblings without autism, and 113 normally developing controls were recruited. Both s reported their   and psychological status and mothers  reported 's behavioral problems. Results: Children with autism had significantly more severe behavioral problems and obtained less affection and more overprotection and authoritarian controlling from their s than the other two groups. Compared to the controls, unaffected siblings showed some behavioral problems, and obtained less maternal care. Withdrawal and attention, social, and thought problems were the most associated behavioral syndromes to distinguish  with autism from those without. Conclusions: In addition to  with autism, who have a wide range of behavioral problems and impaired - interactions, their siblings may be at risk for such problems."
Parenting styles and 's sleep quality: Examining the mediating roles of mindfulness and loneliness,2020,"Background: Sleep quality plays a crucial role in 's physical and mental health. Prior  has documented that   are closely associated with 's sleep quality. However, the psychological processes underlying this relationship are less investigated. Objective: Based on al acceptance-rejection theory and the psychobiological inhibition model of insomnia, the current  aimed to examine the mediating roles of mindfulness and loneliness in the associations between   (i.e., al warmth and al rejection) and 's sleep quality. Methods: A questionnaire survey regarding  , mindfulness, loneliness, and sleep quality was administered to 475 Chinese  (M-age = 10.68 years, SDage = 1.15). Results: al warmth was negatively associated with poor sleep quality, and al rejection was positively associated with poor sleep quality. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis indicated that (a) loneliness, but not mindfulness, mediated the association between al warmth and 's sleep quality, and (b) mindfulness and loneliness exerted both unique and sequential mediating effects on the association between al rejection and 's sleep quality. Conclusion: These findings shed light on possible mechanisms that can account for the associations between   and 's sleep quality, and have implications for intervention strategies aimed at improving 's sleep quality."
Relevant dimensions of parenting style during adolescence: A longitudinal study,2006,"The paper analyses, from a longitudinal perspective, dimensions involved in  Style typology. We are interested in ing its evolution through adolescence and analysing its influence on adolescent adjustment measures. Therefore, in addition to al affect and behavioural control, we  evaluate psychological con trol and self-disclosure measures. The sample were 10 1 adolescents interviewed at three different ages: 13, 15 and 17 years. Our  show that affect, psychological control and adolescent self-disclosure are notably stable throughout adolescence. However, behavioural control, in spite its relative stability, markedly decreases with age. There are  some interesting gender differences. Overall, the  stress the importance for healthy adolescent development of both al monitoring and fostering autonomy in a positive family environment that promotes adolescent communication."
Transformational parenting style is positively related with physical self-concept during early adolescence,2018,"The aim of this  consisted in testing how perceived transformational   and participants' age were associated with the different dimensions of physical self-concept. A total of six hundred and seventy-six students (aged 12-14) from Secondary Compulsory Education took part in this . A Spanish adaptation of the Transfonnational  Questionnaire (TPQ) [Cuestionario de Estilo al Transformacional] and an adapted version of the Physical Self-Description Questionnaire-Short Form (PSDQ) [Cuestionario de Autoconcepto Fisico-version reducida] were used. Results showed that a profound transformational   was associated with higher perception of resistance, strength. coordination, appearance, and physical self-concept when compared with other variables, such as gender or Body Mass Index. No differences were found between these dimensions based on participants' age. We should consider the possibility of carrying out family interventions in different areas if we aim to increase the distinctive traits of this al collectivization ."
PARENTING STYLE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CONFLICT BETWEEN PARENTAL AND BUSINESS ROLES,2019,"The paper discusses the connection between   and the scope of the conflict between al and business roles. For a  , we used the concept of Dianne Baumrind (1966/2002), who defined three basic types of a - relationship: authoritarian, authoritative and permissive. The problem of conflict is accessed through the theory of work-family conflict, the Greenhaus and Beutell model (Greenhaus and Beutell, 1985), according to which the impact of work on a family consists of three sub-dimensions: time-based conflict, strain-based conflict, and behaviour-based conflict. The survey involved 204 respondents - employed s with at least one  aged 3 to 16 years. The  of the  have shown that the authoritarian and the permissive   is accompanied by a more obvious conflict of al and business roles, while the positive effect of employment is linked to the authoritative  . Implications of the obtained findings show that business and family responsibilities enable s to participate in multiple roles, that can be used to promote their growth and development and better functioning in the al role.

Social Variations in Perceived Parenting Styles among Norwegian Adolescents,2014,"Previous  has documented the associations between  and   and  and adolescent outcomes. Little is known, however, about the social structuring of  in contemporary Nordic welfare states. A possible hypothesis is that socioeconomic variations in   in -day Norway will be small because of material affluence, limited income inequality, and an active welfare state. This  examines social variations in  as perceived by Norwegian adolescents (N = 1362), with a focus on four   dimensions: responsiveness, demandingness, neglecting, and intrusive. Responsiveness seems to capture major divisions in . Adolescents in families with fewer economic resources experienced their s as somewhat less responsive, but responsiveness was not related to s' education. Low al education was on the other hand associated with perceptions of s as neglecting and intrusive. Viewing s as demanding did neither vary with al education nor with family economy. Substantial variations in   persist in -day Norway, and these variations correspond moderately with the families' placement in the social structure. Indicators of  and   may be useful indicators of some aspects of  and adolescent well-being."

Parenting style in a rapidly developing country: A report from the state of Qatar,2021,"Objective: To investigate the different  of  in the State of Qatar, a country that is considered a cosmopolitan hub with rapid development. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional  was conducted at Sidra Medicine, the only tertiary pediatric hospital in Qatar. s of  3-14 years old were offered a questionnaire. Results: A total of 114 questionnaires were completed (response rate = 95%). Approximately 65% of s were between 30 and 39 years of age. Almost 90% of s state that they are confident of their  ability. More than 90% of the participating s stated that they are responsive to their 's feeling and needs, give comfort and understanding when their  is upset, praise their  when well-behaved, give reasons why rules should be followed, help  understand the impact of their behavior, explain consequences of bad behavior, take into account their 's desire before asking him/her to do something, encourage their  to freely express him/herself when disagreeing with his/her s, and show respect to their 's opinion. However, 60% of s sometimes scold, yell, and criticize their  when he/she misbehaves but less than 50% of them use threats as a consequence with little or no justification. Furthermore, two-thirds of s give consequences by putting their  off somewhere with little or no explanation. Moreover, one in four participants gives in to their  when he/she causes a commotion about something, threatens their  with consequences more often than actually giving them, and states consequences to their  and do not actually do them. Conclusion: Residents in Qatar have a mixed type of al  (authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive). This  will guide us to raise the awareness about the types of   in Qatar, in order to provide professional  counseling taking into consideration the cultural background."
Parenting Styles and Hormone Levels as Predictors of Physical and Indirect Aggression in Boys and Girls,2014,"This  examines the relationship between  , androgen levels, and measures of physical and indirect aggression. Peer ratings of aggression were obtained from 159 eight-year-old  (89 boys and 70 girls).   (authoritative, authoritarian or permissive) were assessed using the  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ). Saliva samples were obtained from  and assayed for testosterone and androstenedione concentrations. A regression analysis revealed that high testosterone levels were associated with a higher level of physical aggression in boys with authoritarian mothers. Testosterone was  found to moderate the relationship between father's authoritarian  and physical aggression in girls, with both moderate and high levels being significant. In relation to indirect aggression, moderate and high levels of testosterone were associated with higher levels of this type of aggression in girls with permissive mothers. Our  highlight the importance of taking into account the interaction of biological and psychosocial variables when investigating aggressive behavior. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Examining the relationship between family context and 's physical activity beliefs: The role of parenting style,2012,"Objectives: Previous  studies examining al influences on 's physical activity (PA) have focused primarily on s' own PA behavior, as well as their PA-related beliefs and socially supportive behaviors. The  , although aligned with this mainstream al influence , was grounded in a broader  development perspective to examine the influence of   on 's PA beliefs and quality of   communication. Method: Self-report questionnaires were administered to 173  ranging in age from 9 to 12 years to assess their perceptions of  ,   communication patterns, as well as their own perceptions of fitness competence, value, and goal orientation. Results: Children's constellation of beliefs and attitudes regarding PA as well as their perceptions of the   communication process did vary as a function of the type of   they perceived their s to use. High challenge   was linked to higher perceived fitness competence and value on the part of the . High support   was linked to more positive perceived   communication patterns. Conclusion:   may be a critical underlying family process variable that impacts 's development of a positive constellation of beliefs about PA. Future work is needed to link   and 's PA beliefs to their PA behavior. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Parenting styles revisited: A longitudinal person-oriented assessment of perceived parent behavior,2021,"The pernicious consequences of  psychological control are well-established.   classification schemes, however, typically exclude this behavioral practice, focusing instead on demandingness and responsiveness. The   applies a person-oriented approach to the classification of  , taking into account psychological control. Lithuanian adolescents (239 girls, 215 boys; M-age= 15.14 at the outset) completed questionnaires at annual intervals across high school, describing  behavioral control, support, and psychological control. Longitudinal multidimensional latent class growth analysis (LCGA) yielded four   categories. Two conventional groups emerged: authoritative (highest behavioral control and support, lowest psychological control) and indulgent (high support, low behavioral control, lowest psychological control). Two additional groups emerged in lieu of an authoritarian category: enmeshed (high behavioral control and psychological control, intermediate support) and affectively controlling (highest psychological control, lowest behavioral control and support). Children of authoritative s reported favorable adjustment on a host of indicators, including behavior problems, school engagement, character, self-esteem and interpersonal caring and connection;  of affectively controlling s reported the poorest adjustment on all variables measured."
"Parenting Style, Parental Personality, and Child Temperament in Children with Anxiety Disorders-A Clinical Study from India",2021,"Background: Anxiety disorders are common in  and contribute to adverse developmental outcomes. Although etiological models of  anxiety have identified various environmental factors, very few studies in India have examined these factors in  ing with anxiety disorders. Therefore, the   was designed to examine  , al personality, and  temperament in  with anxiety disorders in an Indian outpatient setting. Methods: In total, 42  with anxiety disorders and 42 typically developing , matched on age and gender, were screened using Child Behavior Checklist, Color Progressive Matrices, and Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders  version. Their s were screened using Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 5.0, following which they filled the questionnaires for  ,  personality, and  temperament. Results: There were significant differences between the two groups on  ,  personality, and  temperament. Anxiety disorder was positively associated with the father's permissiveness and negatively with the mother's authoritativeness and 's sociability. A combination of   and  temperament explained 69% of the variances in  anxiety disorders. There were significant associations between al personality,  temperament, and  .  and  characteristics explained 14%-46% of the variances in  . Conclusion: Results of this  are generally consistent with Western studies outlining the influence of  temperament and   on  outcome and have important implications for clinical management of anxiety disorders."
Linking mother-father differences in parenting to a typology of family parenting styles and adolescent outcomes,2007,"Using longitudinal data from a sample of 451 families with a  in eighth grade at the time of , three  questions have been addressed: First, the  explored the ways in which mothers and fathers differ with regard to four  . Second, the  examined the manner in which individual   combine to form family  . Finally, the Study investigated the extent to which these various  are related to delinquency, depression, and school commitment for adolescents. Regardless of reporter, the most common family   are those in which both s display the same  of . Having two authoritative s is associated with the most positive outcomes for adolescents. In the absence of this optimal family  , there is evidence that having one authoritative  can, in most cases, buffer a  from the deleterious consequences associated with less optimal  of ."
General and food-selection specific parenting style in relation to the healthfulness of parent- choices while grocery shopping,2017,"Past  has demonstrated that   is related to 's health and eating patterns, and that  can vary across time and context. However, there is little evidence about similarities and differences between general, self-reported   and observed  during grocery shopping. The goals of this  were to investigate links between general  , al warmth and limit setting (important dimensions of  ) during grocery shopping, and the healthfulness of foods chosen. Participants were 153  (88 mothers)-  (6-9 years old) dyads. Dyads were brought to a laboratory set up like a grocery store aisle and asked to choose two items from each of three categories (cookies/crackers, cereals, chips/snacks). s were observed in terms of warmth, responsiveness, autonomy granting, and limit setting;  were observed in terms of resistance and negotiation. s reported behaviors related to general . Regression analyses were used to test  hypotheses. Observed al limit setting was related to general  ; observed warmth was not. Observed limit setting (but not observed warmth or self-reported  ) was related to the healthfulness of food choices. Limit setting appears to be the dimension of   that is expressed during grocery shopping, and that promotes healthier food choices. Implications are discussed regarding consistencies in   across situations as well as contributions of   to the development of 's healthy eating. Published by Elsevier Ltd."
"Parenting style and adolescent depressive symptoms, smoking, and academic achievement: Ethnic, gender, and SES differences",1996,"This paper examines whether the relationship between   and adolescent depressive symptoms, smoking, and academic grades varies according to ethnicity, gender and socioeconomic status. Four   are distinguished, based on patterns of -adolescent decision making: autocratic (s decide), authoritative (joint process but s decide), permissive (joint process but adolescent decides), and unengaged (adolescent decides). The sample included 3993 15-year-old White, Hispanic, African-American, and Asian adolescents. Results are generally consistent with previous findings. adolescents with authoritative s had the best outcomes and those with unengaged s were least well adjusted, while the permissive and the autocratic  produced intermediate . For the most part, this pattern held across ethnic and sociodemographic subgroups. There was one exception, suggesting that the relationship between  , especially the unengaged , and depressive symptoms may vary according to gender and ethnicity. More  is needed to replicate and explain this pattern in terms of ecological factors, cultural norms, and socialization goals and practices."
Parenting styles and youth well-being across immigrant generations,2008,"This  examines generational patterns of  , the relationships between   and adolescent well-being among youth of Mexican origin, and the role of generational   patterns in explaining generational patterns in youth behavior (delinquency and alcohol problems) and psychological well-being (depression and self-esteem). This  uses two waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). The proportion of teens with permissive s increased with generation; other   declined. The rate of youth with behavioral problems increased with generation. Self-esteem improved with generation; depression scores did not. Bivariate generational patterns of behavioral and psychological outcomes are a function of the patterns seen for youth with permissive s, coupled with the increase in the proportion of permissive s with each successive generation. In contrast, these outcomes did not worsen with generation for youth with authoritative s."
"Resilience, Parenting Style, and Children's Eating Behavior",2019,"This  aims to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between al resilience and   and the impact of these characteristics on 's eating behaviors and weight. Through a quantitative examination, we found al concerns about their 's weight positively relate to family attitudes toward fruits and vegetables but negatively relate to actual consumption of fruits and vegetables. Contrarily, advance planning of healthy meals among s is negatively associated with family attitudes toward fruits and vegetables but positively associated with 's consumption of fruits and vegetables. Family attitudes toward fruits and vegetables have a significant influence on 's consumption of fruits and vegetables. The personal competence component of al resilience has a significant moderating influence on the relationship between al concerns about their 's weight and his or her consumption of fruits and vegetables. The acceptance of self and life component of al resilience has a significant moderating influence on the relationship between advance planning of healthy meals among s and 's consumption of fruits and vegetables."
Externalizing behaviors in preadolescents: familial risk to externalizing behaviors and perceived parenting styles,2010,"The aim was to investigate the contribution of familial risk to externalizing behaviors (FR-EXT), perceived  , and their interactions to the prediction of externalizing behaviors in preadolescents. Participants were preadolescents aged 10-12 years who participated in TRAILS, a large prospective population-based cohort  in the Netherlands (N = 2,230). Regression analyses were used to determine the relative contribution of FR-EXT and perceived   to  and teacher ratings of externalizing behaviors. FR-EXT was based on lifetime al externalizing psychopathology and the different   (emotional warmth, rejection, and overprotection) were based on the 's perspective. We  investigated whether different dimensions of perceived   had different effects on subdomains of externalizing behavior. We found main effects for FR-EXT (vs. no FR-EXT), emotional warmth, rejection, and overprotection that were fairly consistent across rater and outcome measures. More specific, emotional warmth was the most consistent predictor of all outcome measures, and rejection was a stronger predictor of aggression and delinquency than of inattention. Interaction effects were found for FR-EXT and perceived al rejection and overprotection; other interactions between FR-EXT and   were not significant. Correlations between FR-EXT and perceived   were absent or very low and were without clinical significance. Predominantly main effects of FR-EXT and perceived   independently contribute to externalizing behaviors in preadolescents, suggesting FR-EXT and   to be two separate areas of causality. The relative lack of gene-environment interactions may be due to the epidemiological nature of the , the preadolescent age of the subjects, the measurement level of  and the measurement level of FR-EXT, which might be a consequence of both genetic and environmental factors."
Maternal Representations and Parenting Style in Children Born With and Without an Orofacial Cleft,2018,"Objective: To investigate the evolution of maternal reations (ie, the way s perceive their  in term of temperament, character, behaviors, etc) of  with a cleft at 3 major milestones: before/after reconstructive surgeries and at school age.   was  analyzed and compared with s of  born without a cleft. Design and participants: The sample was composed of 30 mothers of  with an orofacial cleft and 14 mothers of  without a cleft. Maternal reations were assessed when the  was 2 months (before surgery), 12 months (after surgery), and 5 years of age (when starting school) using semistructured interviews that were transcribed and coded according to the subscales of the Working Model of the Child Interview and the al Development Interview. At the 5-year appointment, mothers  completed a questionnaire about  . Results: Results showed no difference across groups (cleft/noncleft) in maternal reations at the 2-month, 12-month, and 5-year assessments. In the cleft group, significant differences were shown between 2 and 12 months in caregiving sensitivity, perceived infant difficulty, fear for the infant's safety, and al pride, all factors being higher at 12 months. Those differences in al reations over time were not found in the noncleft group. Additionally, mothers of the cleft group were significantly more authoritarian than mothers of  without a cleft. Conclusion: The absence of differences across cleft and noncleft groups suggests that having a  with a cleft does not affect maternal reations and emotions between 2 months and 5 years of the 's age. However,   seems to be influenced by the presence of a cleft in the  sample."
Parenting style and Emotional regulation in  with Borderline and Average intellectual functioning,2020,"Background: Children with borderline intellectual functioning re a unique course of behavioral and developmental challenges. One such issue is emotion regulation (ER), leading to poor interpersonal relationships and adjustment issues in adulthood. There are extensive studies highlighting the role of   in emotion regulation. Aim: The   compares the emotion regulation and   in  having borderline intellectual functioning (B IF) versus average intellectual functioning (AIF). Methods: Fifty pairs of - were recruited, 25  with AIF, and 25  with BIF. The intelligence quotient (IQ) score on Malin' s Intelligence Scale for Indian Children (MISIC) was used to identify  as BIF and AIF.

"Pathways of Parenting Style on Adolescents' College Adjustment, Academic Achievement, and Alcohol Risk",2015,"This  examined the pathways of   (permissive, authoritarian, and authoritative) to alcohol consumption and consequences through the mediators of college adjustment and academic achievement (grade point average [GPA]). Participants were 289 students from a private, mid-size, West Coast university (mean age 19.01 years, 58.8% female, and 59.3% Caucasian) who completed online surveys. A path model discovered that receipt of permissive and authoritarian  uniquely predicted poorer college adjustment, but authoritative  predicted better college adjustment. Further, authoritarian  predicted lower GPA, but authoritative  predicted higher GPA. Better college adjustment, in turn, was predictive of fewer negative alcohol-related consequences, whereas higher GPA predicted lower drinking levels. Preventive implications for collegiate counseling centers and collaborative campus-wide health promotion efforts are discussed."
Raising Spanish Children With an Antisocial Tendency: Do We Know What the Optimal Parenting Style Is?,2021,"Families can play an essential role in preventing violent and antisocial behaviors, which are considered a significant public health issue. However, some studies argue that most  are antisocial only during adolescence, and even teenagers can mimic antisocial behavior in ways that are normative and well-adjusted. This  analyzed patterns of competence and adjustment in young adults with and without an antisocial tendency during adolescence from authoritative (characterized by warmth and strictness), authoritarian (strictness but not warmth), indulgent (warmth but not strictness), and neglectful (neither warmth nor strictness) families. Emergent  has indicated that in a European context, the indulgent   is optimal. Offspring's competence and adjustment were captured through self-esteem (academic and family), psychosocial development (self-competence and empathy), and low emotional maladjustment (nervousness and hostility). Participants consisted of a community sample of 489 Spanish young adults, 191 men (39.1%) and 298 women (60.9%), aged 18 to 34 years old. The design was a 4 x 2 x 2 x 2 MANOVA (  x antisocial tendency x sex x age). Analysis of main effects showed that youths with an antisocial tendency have less self-esteem and psychosocial development, but more emotional maladjustment. Regardless of the  , an antisocial tendency during adolescence is consistently associated with worse adjustment in young adults. Both the authoritative and indulgent   are consistently associated with better outcomes (higher self-esteem and psychosocial development, and lower emotional maladjustment) than the authoritarian and neglectful  . However, there are interactions between the   and the antisocial tendency. For young adults without an antisocial tendency, only indulgent  is associated with less emotional maladjustment. These  support the idea that in Europe the indulgent   performs better than the authoritative , but only when raising adolescents without an antisocial tendency. For young adults with an antisocial tendency, indulgent and authoritative  are equally optimal for all the studied outcomes."
Coping Strategies and Parenting Styles in Mothers of Children with and without Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,2014,"The aim of this  was to compare coping strategies and the   of mothers of  who have and have not been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (adhd). The sample consisted of two groups: one of mothers of a  diagnosed with adhd (N = 14) and a control group (N = 35). The methodological approach was to apply two scales that evaluate al educational  and the Coping Strategies Questionnaire (csq), designed to evaluate seven basic coping . The  show differences in the perception of   of mothers of  with adhd compared to the control group, taking the form of more criticism, less expression of affection and more rigid educational behavior. While there were no significant differences between groups in terms of the coping strategies used, a tendency could be seen among mothers of  with adhd to rely more on rational and emotional coping strategies. Identifying the most effective   and coping strategies has direct implications for the treatment of this disorder, as these could have an important impact on how a 's illness develops."
Impact of the parenting style of foster parents on the behaviour problems of foster ,2015,"Background Few studies have analysed the effects of the   used by foster carers on 's behaviour problems. This  examines the role played by the quality of the emotional relationship with foster carers and the kind of discipline they use as regard internalizing and externalizing problems among foster . Methods Participants were 104 foster  (56 boys and 48 girls) and their respective foster families. The Child Behaviour Checklist, the Affect and Communication Scale, and the Rules and Demands Scale were completed by foster s. A series of linear regression analyses were performed using the stepwise method. Results The main findings were as follows: an authoritarian   explained the internalizing problems ed by foster  (11% of the variance); criticism/rejection, authoritarian  and permissive  explained externalizing problems (37% of the variance); and criticism/rejection and authoritarian  explained total problems (29% of the variance). These  indicate that criticism/rejection on the part of foster s, as well as the use of inappropriate   (authoritarian and permissive), has an important effect in relation to the behaviour problems of foster . Conclusions This highlights the key role that foster carers play in terms of tackling the behaviour problems that foster  . The findings  suggest that preparation for fostering should focus especially on ways of helping foster s both to acquire positive  strategies and to avoid authoritarian and permissive ."

The   included 119  (51.2% girls, M-age = 11.67 years) and their s. Data were collected through administration of several self-report measures. The  show a relationship between the majority of the same  and  perfectionism dimensions, thus providing supportive evidence for the Social Learning Model. Concerning the analysis of the role of gender in the transmission of perfectionism, observed fathers' perfectionism only relates with the sons' perfectionism, and mothers' perfectionism relates with daughters' perfectionism. Our findings allow for a deeper understanding of the role of the perception of an authoritarian   in the development of maladaptive perfectionism. Mother and fathers' perceived   contribute more to daughter than son perfectionism. The  contribute to expanding the understanding of the role of al factors in the development of perfectionism."
Maternal Parenting Style and Internalizing and ADHD Symptoms in College Students,2019,"The purpose of the current  was to test for a relation between emerging adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) status, how they reported being reared (i.e., perceived  ), and how the maternal  they received in hood was linked with current adjustment. College students completed online surveys regarding their ADHD status, impairment, and maternal  . Participants with ADHD reported higher levels of maternal authoritarian  (controlling/punitive) and lower levels of maternal authoritative  (structured/supportive) compared with participants without ADHD. Across the entire sample, higher reported maternal authoritative  was associated with lower levels of inattention (IA), hyperactivity/impulsivity (HI), depression, anxiety and stress, and higher levels of maternal authoritarian and permissive  was associated with higher levels of IA, HI, depression, anxiety, and stress. Sex moderated the relations between maternal   and psychopathology such that women who reported low levels of authoritative   reported higher levels of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, where no differences in psychopathology were found in men across both low and high levels of authoritative . These links between current adjustment and maternal   suggest authoritative  may protect against negative adjustment in college students and may be especially important for women."
Children's fears and its relation to parenting style and demographic variables of  and parents,2021,"The purpose of this  was to examine the fears of Jordanian  and how it related to   and demographics. The  used the quantitative methodology of a survey to examine fears of a sample of 640 Jordanian  aged 4-9 in Al-Zarqa city. Results revealed that the most specific fear was imaginary or animals. The least feared type was loud noises. Results  found that 's fears differ due to the age of the  in favour of younger . Furthermore, analyses revealed no significant differences due to father's and mother's education level, monthly income, 's birth order, gender or residency. Results  showed a strong positive correlation between mother authoritarian   and 's fears. Based on the findings, younger  and  whose mothers use an authoritarian   are at higher risk of developing fears that can grow into anxiety, phobia, or worry."
"Parenting styles, parental response to  emotion, and family emotional responsiveness are related to  emotional eating",2011,"The aim of the   was to examine the relations of  ,  response to negative  emotion, and family emotional expressiveness and support to  emotional eating. Mothers (N = 450) completed questionnaires and their 6-8-year-old  (N = 450) were interviewed. Results showed that emotional eating was negatively predicted by authoritative   and family open expression of affection and emotion, and positively predicted by  minimizing response to  negative emotion. Results suggest the need for early prevention/intervention efforts directed to these  and family variables. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

"Relationship between parenting styles, psychopathological intensity and type of symptoms in a adolescents clinical sample",2016,"An investigation was conducted to analyze the relationship between perceived  , ed intensity psychopathology and externalizing-internalizing dimensions in a clinical sample of adolescents aged 13 to 18. The  found indicate that the psychopathological intensity is associated with age, with older age and over intensity; and with female gender. Only two dimensions of perceived   were found related to psychopathological intensity: psychological control negatively and humor positively. As opposed to other studies consulted, the psychological control dimension appeared linked to externalizing symptoms and not with internalizing."

Based on protection motivation theory, this  (a) predicted al mediation based on s' threat and efficacy perceptions and (b) predicted threat and efficacy perceptions based on   and s' addiction to smartphone use. An online survey of 448 s of fourth to sixth graders was conducted. Results showed that both restrictive and active al mediation were predicted by perceived severity, response efficacy, and self-efficacy. With regard to  , (a) authoritative  was positively related to perceived severity as well as response-and self-efficacy, whereas (b) permissive  was negatively related to self-efficacy. In addition, s' addiction was a negative predictor of perceived severity, but a positive predictor of perceived susceptibility."
Parenting styles are associated with overall  dietary quality within low-income and food-insecure households,2019,"Objective: To examine the association between   and overall  dietary quality within households that are low-income and food-insecure. Design: Child dietary intake was measured via a 24 h dietary recall. Dietary quality was assessed using the Healthy Eating Index-2005 (HEI-2005).   were measured and scored using the  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire. Linear regressions were used to test main and interaction associations between HEI-2005 scores and  . Setting: Non-probability sample of low-income and food-insecure households in South Carolina, USA. Participants: - dyads (n 171). s were >= 18 years old and  were 9-15 years old. Results: We found a significant interaction between authoritative and authoritarian   scores. For those with a mean authoritarian score, each unit increase in authoritative score was associated with a higher HEI-2005 score (b = 3 center dot 36, P < 0.05). For those with an authoritarian score that was 1 sd above the mean authoritarian score, each unit increase in authoritative score was associated with a higher HEI-2005 score (b = 8.42, P < 0.01). For those with an authoritarian score that was -1 sd below the mean authoritarian score, each unit increase in authoritative score was associated with a lower HEI-2005 score; however, this was not significant (b = -1 center dot 69, P > 0 center dot 05). Permissive   scores were negatively associated with  dietary quality (b = -2 center dot 79, P < 0 center dot 05). Conclusions:   should be considered an important variable that is associated with overall dietary quality in  living within low-income and food-insecure households."
"Parenting style, coping efficacy, and risk-taking behavior in Chinese young adults",2020,"The goal of this  was to examine the relationship between three   (warmth, rejection, and overprotection), coping efficacy and risk-taking behavior in Chinese young adults. A total of 719 subjects completed three instruments: the Egna Minneu av Bardndosnauppforstran, the Coping Efficacy Questionnaire and the Adolescent Risk-Taking Questionnaire. Structural equation modeling  showed that maternal warmth (negatively) and rejection (positively), but not overprotection, correlated with risk-taking behavior via coping efficacy, whereas paternal rejection and overprotection (positively), but not warmth, correlated with risk-taking behavior via coping efficacy. These  suggest that   indirectly associate with risk-taking behavior through coping efficacy in young adults."
"Parenting style, individuation, and mental health of Egyptian adolescents",2006,"Three questionnaires that measure  , adolescent-family connectedness, and mental health were administered to 351 Egyptian adolescents. Results show that in rural communities the authoritarian  is more predominant in the  of male adolescents, while the authoritative  is more predominant in the  of female adolescents. In urban communities, on the other hand, the authoritarian  was more predominant in the  of female adolescents. The connectedness of all female adolescents with their family was stronger than that of male adolescents. The connectedness of girls was found to be more emotional and financial in villages and to be more functional in town. Female adolescents reported a higher frequency of psychological disorders. Mental health was associated with authoritative , but not with authoritarian . It seems that authoritarian  within an authoritarian culture is not as harmful as within a liberal culture.

Parenting and Obsessive Compulsive Symptoms: Implications of Authoritarian Parenting,2010,"Cognitive behavioral theories of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have hypothesized a central role of social learning in the development of OCD. Research indicates that learning via key developmental relationships, such as - interactions, may account for the emergence and maintenance of OC symptoms in adulthood. Baumrind identified three al authority prototypes or , including permissive, authoritative, and authoritarian, that differ on the two dimensions of nurture and behavioral control. Permissive s allow their  to do as they wish with little discipline, whereas authoritative s implement reasonable guidelines while still providing a warm and nurturing environment. The third , authoritarian, res  that is rigid and values strict adherence to rules with lower levels of nurturing. To date, there has been no  examining these   and OCD symptomatology. The current investigation examined the relationships between  , obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms, and OC-related dysfunctional beliefs (i.e., obsessive beliefs) in a nonclinical sample (N = 227). Participants completed measures of these constructs, as well as a measure of general mood and anxiety symptoms. Results indicated that the authoritarian   was significantly associated with both OC symptoms and OC beliefs (e.g., beliefs about the importance of thoughts and personal responsibility), even after controlling for general distress. Analyses  revealed that OC beliefs act as a partial mediator of the relationship between   and OC symptoms. Findings are discussed in light of the implications for future , particularly that pertaining to risk for OCD and the development of vulnerability factors."
"Associations between early life harshness, parents' parenting style, and relationship quality in China",2021,"Previous studies revealed that early life stress is associated with romantic relationship quality in the life history perspective in Western nations. The current  examined the relationships between life history strategy, early life harshness/s'  , and romantic relationship quality, as well as life history strategy as a mediator in the association between early life harshness/s'   and relationship quality in China. A total of 263 individuals in romantic relationships participated in a questionnaire survey. Results revealed the direct effects of early life harshness/s'   and relationship quality. Both early life harshness and s'   have indirect effects on relationship quality through the life history strategy -> communication/commitment paths. Thus, individuals with hood adverse experiences and harsh s'   were more inclined to adopt a fast life history strategy, which was negatively associated with relationship quality."
Effects of Family Functioning and Parenting Style on Early Entrants' Academic Performance and Program Completion,2013,"The purpose of the current  was to examine the predictive nature of   and overall family environment on the academic performance and program completion of early college entrants. Furthermore, gender and family form were examined as possible moderators to these relationships. A total of 88 early college entrants participated in this . Results indicate that gender and family form had no measurable effect on grade point average or on program completion among early college entrants.   combined with overall family environment was not predictive of program completion or changes in academic performance. However, further analyses revealed that an authoritative   was related to increases in grade point average among those students who showed an increase in grade point average during the program."
Parental involvement and Chinese elementary students' achievement goals: the moderating role of parenting style,2018,"Past  has revealed direct effects of al involvement and   on 's achievement goals separately, however, it is necessary to investigate the interactive mechanism in an integrated way. This  examined the relations between 's perception of different dimensions of al involvement (i.e. home-based involvement, school-based involvement and academic socialisation) and their achievement goals, and the moderating role of   (i.e. al autonomy support vs. psychological control). Participants were 614 Chinese fourth and fifth grades students. Results showed that home-based involvement was positively associated with performance-approach goals, school-based involvement was positively associated with mastery goals, and academic socialisation was positively associated with both mastery and performance-approach goals. al psychological control moderated the relationships between performance-approach goals and two types of al involvement: Academic socialisation and home-based involvement. These findings underscored the need of taking a multidimensional approach in conceptualising al involvement, and that al involvement should be expressed in an appropriate context of  ."
Influences of the Differences Between Mothers' and Children's Perceptions of Parenting Styles,2020,"In this , we explored the differences between mothers' and 's perceptions of mothers'   (DMCP of MPS) and examined the effects of these differences on 's depression, aggression, and ego-resilience. A total of 233 pairs of mothers and teen-aged  participated in the . Our analysis produced four main findings. First, the mothers perceived their  attitudes as more rational and affectionate than their  did;  whose mothers rated their   more favorably had higher levels of depression and aggression and lower ego-resilience. Second, the correlation analysis and the structural equation model verification confirmed that as the DMCP of MPS increased, 's levels of depression and aggression increased, and their ego-resilience decreased. Third, ego-resilience partly mediated the relationship between DMCP-Rationality and depression. Lastly, we found that ego-resilience and depression had dual mediation effects on the relationship between DMCP-Rationality and 's aggression. This paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings and suggestions for future studies."
"Parenting Style, Personality Traits, and Interpersonal Relationships: A Model of Prediction of Internet Addiction",2020,"This  examined how   can help or hinder the development of healthy family relationships when Internet addiction is a concern. A sample of 700 middle school and 500 college students in Zhuhai (a special administrative city in Southern China) were surveyed using self-report questionnaire scales to examine the links among Internet addiction,  , personality traits, and interpersonal communication skills. The findings indicate that problematic  , such as strict attitudes, heavy punishment, and regularly withholding affection significantly predict individuals' Internet addiction. Dysfunctional - relations can drive  to extensively use the Internet for escape. In addition, personality traits of introversion, tendency to lie, neuroticism, and psychoticism are positively associated with Internet addiction. Poor interpersonal skills are  linked to self-reported Internet addiction. This  found an interaction effect among  , interpersonal relationships, and personality traits that produced a significant joint effect predicting Internet addiction. The findings provide some guidance for policy makers and professional counselors involved with youth and families struggling to treat Internet addiction."
Relationship of working mothers' parenting style and consistency to early hood development: a longitudinal investigation,2009,"P>Title. Relationship of working mothers'   and consistency to early hood development: a longitudinal investigation. Aim. This paper is a report of a longitudinal  of the relationship of working mothers'   to their 's social competence and vocabulary/motor/intellectual development. Background. With an increasing number of women choosing to remain in the workforce after starting a family, there has been a concomitant increase in use of non-al care facilities to help look after the  while the mother is at work. This increase in non-al care has led to a dramatic change in the traditional -rearing environment. Methods. Long-term investigations were conducted over a period of 2 years in 41 Japanese government-licensed care facilities. Child development was evaluated by care professionals and   was assessed by questionnaire. A total of 504  and their mothers participated in the . Data collection was carried out in 2004 and 2006. Findings. We found that the changes in   were statistically significantly related to 's development after 2 years. For instance, changes in the - playing routine contributed to the 's social competence (odds ratio = 11 center dot 088). Variation in working mothers' disciplinary practices was  associated with 's vocabulary development after 2 years (odds ratio = 2 center dot 246). Conclusion. Working mothers should increase interactions with their  in their free time to reduce the risk of developmental delay. Daily care support provided by family members or social organizations for long-term working mothers is helpful in mediating the negative relationship of mothers' working with 's development."
Symptoms of Internet Gaming Disorder and Parenting Styles in Romanian Adolescents,2020,"Online video gaming has been endorsed as a potential addictive behavior with negative psychological and functional consequences and has been extensively studied among adolescents and young individuals. The aim of this cross-sectional  was to estimate the prevalence of symptoms of the Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) in a sample of 278 Romanian early adolescents (aged 10 to 14, 52.5% females) and their s, and to examine the role of al  of s in predicting the symptoms of IGD in their . Statistical analyses showed that 31 (22%) adolescents had clinically relevant symptoms of IGD. A logistic regression model revealed that a dominant permissive  of s was substantially related to symptoms of IGD in their . Findings highlight a strong correlation between   and symptoms of IGD, emphasizing the importance of al involvement in both the prevention and development of IGD in early adolescence."
Culture-specific views of  maltreatment and parenting styles in a Pacific-island community,1999,"Objective: Providing culturally sensitive definitions of  abuse is difficult as perceptions of what constitutes abuse can vary around the world. This  was undertaken to assess how teachers in the Republic of Palau perceived the severity of potentially abusive incidents and what types of recommendations, if any, they would have for situations judged as severely abusive. Attitudes about  rearing practices were  evaluated. Methods: Teachers (n = 141) were given: (1) a questionnaire consisting of 25 vignettes describing / interactions that were potentially abusive and asked to rate the severity of abuse and recommended interventions for each vignette; and (2) a 40-item   questionnaires to evaluate attitudes about -rearing practices. Results: Teachers identified and recommended interventions for more severe forms of abuse at rates similar to other international samples. For less severe al misconduct, teachers were reluctant to involve nonfamily and outside agencies. Sexual abuse was rated as the most serious type of abuse and when identified, intervention was highly recommended. Some traditional Palauan  practices that might be considered maltreatment by other cultures were not considered abusive. For  , older individuals were more likely to use guilt induction and less likely to use methods of acceptance. Aggressive   were negatively correlated with all forms of abuse, suggesting that teachers who used aggressive disciplinary  were less likely to perceive abusive situations as harmful. Conclusions: These  indicate that cultural values and practices play important roles in shaping the definition and interpretation of  maltreatment. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd."
The impact of parenting styles on  developmental outcome: The role of academic self-concept as a mediator,2018,"Although the importance of   directly influencing  development is well established, fewer studied have examined whether    affect 's behavioural problems indirectly, mediated through 's academic self-concept (ASC). We examined direct and shared effects of   on behavioural problems of 199 Kurdish primary school  with a mean age of 11 years 7 months (range 11 years 5 months to 12 years 3 months). Questionnaires measured   ( version of Alabama  Questionnaire), assessed 's ASC (Myself-As-Learner Scale) and identified 's behavioural problems with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). PROCESS analysis was used to perform the mediation analysis. The  revealed that positive and negative  composites are indirectly related to 's internalising behaviour problems. In addition, ASC partially mediated the relationship between the negative  composite and prosocial behaviour. However, the mediation analysis did not show the expected indirect effect of   on externalising problems as being mediated via ASC. Hence, we argue that the ASC serves as a significant mediator in the relationship between   with prosocial behaviour and internalising problems."
Influence of parenting styles in the context of adolescents' energy balance-related behaviors: Findings from the FLASHE study,2019,"Lack of compliance with dietary and activity guidelines contributes to the high prevalence of overweight and obesity among adolescents. Intervention programs need enhanced strategies to promote healthy life behaviors. Although adolescents have more autonomy than younger , s still play an important role in influencing adolescents' energy balance-related behaviors (EBRBs).   may have an overarching effect on adolescents' EBRBs. The purpose of this  was to inform improvements to the design of intervention programs for the s of adolescents by examining influences of   on adolescents' EBRBs. The current  used data from the Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating (FLASHE) Study, which was an online survey on factors affecting adolescents' EBRBs among a national sample of adolescent- dyads (n = 1521; aged 12-17). Adolescents reported  dimensions of responsiveness and demandingness as well as  practices related to fruit and vegetable intake, junk food and sugary drink intake, physical activity, and screen time. They  reported food intake frequencies and time spent in physical activity and sedentary behaviors. Moderation and mediation analyses found that the potential protective effect of junk food/sugary drink- and physical activity-related  practices were significant among non-authoritarian s. In addition,   had significant associations with adolescents' EBRBs after adjusting for the mediation effects of corresponding  practices. These findings suggest that further  and intervention programs need to consider the potential influence of   on adolescents' EBRBs.  skill education to improve the connection between s and adolescents may enhance the effectiveness of healthy life interventions."
Parenting Styles and Children's Emotional Intelligence: What do We Know?,2011,"The theory of emotional intelligence has elicited great interest both in the academic and the nonacademic world. Therapists, educators, and s want to know what they can do to help  develop their emotional intelligence. However, most of the  in this field has investigated adults' emotional intelligence. This  reviews the scarce  literature in the area of 's emotional intelligence. It  reviews the way in which   and practices predict 's emotional intelligence in similar or different ways that they predict other developmental outcomes. Based on the  literature, four main dimensions of  are identified that are relevant to the  of emotional intelligence: al responsiveness, al positive demandingness, al negative demandingness, and al emotion-related coaching. al responsiveness, al emotion-related coaching, and al positive demandingness are related to 's higher emotional intelligence, while al negative demandingness is related to 's lower emotional intelligence. Additionally, social-emotional intervention programs used in schools have succeeded in improving 's emotional skills. Implications for practitioners are discussed."

Using data from Honors College students at a Midwestern university, a path model suggests that neuroticism and conscientiousness are positively related to self-oriented perfectionism, whereas neuroticism and authoritarian   are positively related to socially prescribed perfectionism. In addition, both selforiented and socially prescribed perfectionism are positively related to performance goal orientation. However, personality traits and   did not have significant relationships with performance goal orientation in the model. Potential reasons for these findings, along with educational implications and suggestions for future , are discussed."

The Impact of Parenting Styles on Adolescent Alcohol Use: The TRAILS Study,2013,"Aims: To investigate the influence of   (over-protection, emotional warmth, and rejection) in early adolescence on regular alcohol use in late adolescence. Methods: We analyzed data from the first three waves (mean ages: 11.09, 13.56, and 16.27 years, respectively) of a population- based prospective cohort  of 2,230 adolescents, conducted between 2001 and 2007. Adolescents reported on al overprotection, emotional warmth, and rejection (T1). Regular alcohol use was defined as six and seven glasses or more a week for girls and boys, respectively. We further assessed family socioeconomic status, al divorce, al alcohol use, educational level of the adolescent, and alcohol use at baseline. Results: al overprotection had the strongest relationship to regular alcohol use: adolescents who perceived more al overprotection were at increased risk of developing regular alcohol use, even after adjustment for several confounders. Rejection was not related to adolescents' alcohol use and, after adjustment for the other variables, neither was emotional warmth. Conclusion: Overprotective  is a determinant of future regular adolescent alcohol use and therefore health professionals should pay particular attention to those adolescents who have overprotective s. The role of adolescent characteristics in the relationship between overprotection and alcohol use deserves further . Copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel"
The  of narcissus: Insights into narcissists' parenting styles,2017,"Individuals scoring high on trait narcissism are characterised by grandiosity, self-centredness, and lack of empathy, ing in troubled interpersonal relationships (e.g., with acquaintances and relationship partners). Do these troubled relationships extend to their own ? In this online  of 368 s, we examined whether grandiose narcissists are less likely to adopt optimal   (authoritative) and more likely to adopt non-optimal   (authoritarian and permissive) and began to explore underlying mechanisms in terms of low empathy and unresponsive-caregiving. Narcissism was negatively associated with optimal , and positively associated with non-optimal , controlling for Big Five personality and attachment dimensions. Sequential mediation revealed that narcissists' low empathy predicts unresponsive-caregiving towards their (ren), which in turn predicts low optimal and high non-optimal  practices. These effects are driven by narcissists' maladaptive traits. Exploring links between al personality and  allows ers to identify individuals at risk of poor .

"Educational styles, parenting stressors and psychopathological symptoms in parents of adolescents with high-risk behaviours",2017,"Aims: The main goal of this  was to determine the characteristics of s who sought help from two prevention programmes due to having an adolescent  who s high-risk behaviours. Methods: The sample was composed of 374 s (169 fathers and 205 mothers). Information on socio-demographic characteristics, psychopathological symptoms, emotional states, educational  and maladjustment to everyday life was collected. Findings: The  show statistically differences by gender. Mothers obtained a higher degree of psychopathology symptoms, maladjustment and al stress relative to fathers. Mothers  used more frequently authoritative and permissive  . In general, authoritarian and permissive   and stressful perceptions of the al role are associated with more psychopathological symptoms and with maladjustment. Finally, the following variables predicted the severity of psychopathological symptoms: secondary education, maladjustment, stressful perceptions of the al role and authoritarian and permissive  . Conclusions: This  highlights the need to assess the psychological problems of s of adolescents with high-risk behaviours and to develop specific intervention programmes."
The knowledgeable parenting style: stance takings and subject positions in media encounters,2014,"In today's media-saturated societies it can be assumed that encounters with therapists and other experts may have implications for adult learning. Taking the point of departure in the idea of public pedagogy, and by using a close-up analysis of interview talk, the pedagogical agency the media may have on  is investigated. Drawing upon the discursive notions of , stance takings and subject positions, a pattern of regularities emerges called 'the knowledgeable  '. The knowledgeable  is fashioned through various, yet typical ways of assuming stances and negotiating positions in media encounters, by displaying recognition, discrimination and insight. The  illustrates how the media's claim on a pedagogical role is acknowledged, however, what is provided to be valuable competence is not just accepted. While the interviewed adults mainly exclude themselves from that site of public intervention, the knowledge provided and instructions given are depicted as having the potential of facilitating learning for 'other s'. Aply, the ways in which people rhetorically approach and systematically establish stances  reveal subject positions associated with learning. A dynamic space is created where the displayed norms for adequate behaviour, and invitations to act upon that knowledge, are subject to constant tension."
"Social representations of the development of intelligence, parental values and parenting styles: a theoretical model for analysis",2013,"Within the theoretical framework of social reations theory, a substantial body of literature has advocated and shown that, as interpretative systems and forms of knowledge concurring in the construction of a social reality, social reations are guides for action, influencing behaviours and social relations. Based on this assumption, the primary goal of the current  was to investigate the relationship between social reations of the development of intelligence and   while  examining the role played by the values that s desire for their . The sample included 466 subjects with educational responsibilities (117 fathers, 227 mothers and 122 mother-teachers). Participants completed a self-administered survey on their reations of the development of intelligence, values desired for their  and  . A theoretical model which examined the relations among these variables was tested. Structural equation modelling procedures indicated, as hypothesised, that dimensions which emphasise the role of s and the importance of constant accompaniment of  for the development of intelligence influence the authoritative  , while dimensions which outline the role of school and teachers relate to authoritarian and permissive  . Additionally, although in some cases values were seen both to be determined by social reations and to influence  , the meditational hypothesis of values was not fully confirmed. Overall, the  obtained suggest that social reations,  and values tend to build up a potentially significant organisation for al activities. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings in  and educational intervention are discussed."
The Influence of Culture on Latino Fathers' Parenting Styles,2021,"Objectives: Although Latina mothers have been studied extensively, less consideration has been given to the impact of culture on Latino fathers' . This  explores the relationship of six Latinx cultural constructs-familismo, simpatia, personalismo, respeto, traditional machismo, and caballerismo-on the   of Latino fathers. Method: We analyzed data from 309 Latino fathers on the relationship between  -authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive-and the aforementioned cultural values. Results: Using multiple regression, we found that higher levels of personalismo and caballerismo and lower levels of traditional machismo were associated with authoritative ; higher levels of simpatia, respeto, and traditional machismo and lower levels of personalismo and caballersimo were associated with authoritarian ; and higher levels of familismo, simpatia, respeto, and traditional machismo and lower levels of personalismo and caballerismo were associated with permissive . Conclusions: The   illuminates the need for more culturally competent and strengths-based interventions for Latino fathers, especially interventions that foster higher levels of personalismo, respeto, and caballerismo and decrease emphasis on simpatia and traditional machismo. Further investigation is needed to demonstrate how the relationship between   and cultural values impacts  outcomes.</p>"
Parenting Style and Adolescent Externalizing Behaviors: The Moderating Role of Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia,2016,"This longitudinal  was conducted with 262 adolescents (M age=15.3) and their s to examine adolescent respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA; baseline and reactivity) as a moderator of the relationship between   and adolescent externalizing behaviors. This was conceptualized within the differential susceptibility to the environment framework, which proposes that  with greater sensitivity to environmental influences benefit more from supportive environments but are at greater risk in averse environments. In this , low RSA baseline was associated with greater susceptibility. In confirmation of hypotheses, males with low RSA baseline had the most externalizing behaviors when mother or father authoritative  was low or when mother authoritarian  was high. Contrary to hypotheses, females with greater RSA reactivity (high susceptibility) did more poorly when authoritarian  was low or authoritative  was high. Differential gender socialization and the task used to elicit RSA reactivity are suggested reasons for gender differences."
Interaction between maternal and paternal parenting styles with infant temperament in emerging behavior problems,2019,"This  examined the interaction effects of infant temperament (negative affect, orienting/regulatory capacity, surgency) on the relationship between maternal and paternal   (authoritative, authoritarian, permissive) and externalizing and internalizing behaviors simultaneously. A diverse sample of mothers (N = 186) and fathers (N = 142) reported on infant temperament of their 6-month-olds and their 's internalizing and externalizing behaviors one year later. Significant interactions revealed: (a) surgency moderated maternal authoritative and paternal permissive   and externalizing behaviors; and (b) surgency moderated maternal authoritarian and paternal authoritative   and internalizing behaviors. No significant interactions were found between maternal and paternal   and their report of their infants' orienting/regulatory capacity and negative affect. Findings suggest interaction effects may appear beginning in infancy."
Parenting Styles and Parent-Adolescent Relationships: The Mediating Roles of Behavioral Autonomy and Parental Authority,2018,"The -adolescent relationship has been a classic  topic, and ers have found that   (e.g., authoritative, authoritarian) are closely related to various qualities of -adolescent relationships (e.g., cohesion, conflict). However, little empirical work has addressed how these variables correlate with each other in mainland China, nor has prior  addressed internal psychological mechanisms. The   investigated the associations between   and -adolescent relationship factors, examined the mediating effects of adolescents' expectations of behavioral autonomy and beliefs about al authority, and explored whether adolescent gender moderated these effects. Results from a sample of 633 Chinese adolescents (7th grade: M-age = 13.50 +/- 0.62 years, 9th grade: M-age = 15.45 +/- 0.67 years, 11th grade: M-age = 17.30 +/- 0.75 years) suggested similar levels of -adolescent conflict frequency for all  . However, for -adolescent conflict intensity, youth of neglectful and authoritarian s reported higher levels compared to those with indulgent s. The highest levels of cohesion with both s were reported by adolescents with authoritative s, followed by indulgent, authoritarian and neglect  . Cohesion with mothers for youth with authoritative or indulgent mothers was higher for girls than boys. Adolescents' expectation for behavioral autonomy mediated the links between   and conflict, whereas adolescents' beliefs about the legitimacy of al authority mediated the links between   and cohesion; some of these mediating effects differed by gender. Findings highlight the importance of ing potential effects of adolescents' values and attitudes within the family system in specific cultural contexts."
Mediating perceived parenting styles-test anxiety relationships: Academic procrastination and maladaptive perfectionism,2014,"We investigated perceived authoritarian and authoritative   in mothers and fathers, academic procrastination, maladaptive perfectionism, and both affective and cognitive test anxieties using self-reports of 206 undergraduates (women = 160; men = 46). Supporting  hypotheses, academic procrastination and maladaptive perfectionism concurrently mediated the positive relationship between perceived authoritarian fathering and both affective and cognitive test anxieties, but only maladaptive perfectionism mediated the positive relationship between perceived authoritarian mothering and both affective and cognitive test anxieties. Conversely, supporting  hypotheses, academic procrastination and maladaptive perfectionism concurrently mediated the inverse relationship between perceived authoritative  (in mothers and fathers separately) and both affective and cognitive test anxieties. Our  added to the literature by establishing academic procrastination and maladaptive perfectionism as concurrent mediators in the relationships between perceived   and test anxiety, except for perceived authoritarian mothering. These findings could improve academic success and retention efforts among vulnerable undergraduates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Parenting Styles and Practices of Latino Parents and Latino Fifth Graders' Academic, Cognitive, Social, and Behavioral Outcomes",2014,"A vast literature documents a host of advantages conferred upon middle class European American  whose s employ an authoritative  of , including enhanced academic achievement and positive behavioral outcomes. The literature is much less clear about the relationship between al authority  and  outcomes in other cultural contexts. In this , we examined the relations among authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive   and practices and several academic and behavioral outcomes among fifth grade Latino/a students. We found significant positive relations between al authoritativeness and grades, academic engagement, social competence, self-regulation, and perspective-taking as well as negative relations between authoritativeness and aggression. We found no relations between authoritarian or permissive   and  outcomes. We consider these findings in light of what other ers have posited about collectivist   and practices."
Turkish prospective early hood teachers' emotional intelligence level and its relationship to their parents' parenting styles,2016,"The current  explored Turkish prospective early hood teachers' emotional intelligence scores in order to determine whether levels indicated differentiations according to grade level, and  . Participants responded to the Turkish version of the  Style Inventory and Emotional Intelligence Scale (EIS). EIS  contains the Perception of Own Emotions (POE), Understanding Others' Emotions (UOE) and Regulating Emotions (RE) subscales. Study findings revealed that participants had moderate scores on the POE, UOE, and RE subscales and for whole emotional intelligence. Significant differences in total emotional intelligence and some subscales were found among grade levels and  . However findings showed that prospective teachers' EI level did not increase as their professional education level increases. Also, prospective teachers with neglecting s obtained the lowest mean scores from the total scale and every subscale for EIS. The  concluded that teacher education programs should support emotional development too."

Age and Gender Differences in Perceived Parenting Styles and Emotional Outcomes in Early Adolescents,,"Early adolescents' perception of   is crucial to their  and future physical and mental well-being. The main aim of the   was to analyze differences in   between mothers and fathers and differences on emotional state scales (anxiety, depression, and purpose in life) depending on gender, age, and family structure in 744 girls (54%) and boys (45.7%) aged between 10 and 12 years. The  showed that the early adolescents perceived greater levels of affect than criticism, with mothers being considered more affectionate than fathers. The greater the perceived affect and communication, the greater was the perception of purpose in life and the lower the levels of anxiety and depression in early adolescents. Boys showed higher levels of perceived criticism and rejection. Family affect and communication play a key role in purpose in life and emotional well-being of , with   being a determining factor."
Emotional autonomy and perceived parenting styles: relational analysis in the Hong Kong cultural context,2009,"Three hundred and seven teacher education students of a Hong Kong university were administered two questionnaires, one measuring emotional autonomy (EAS) and the other measuring perceived   (PAQ) of their s. It was found that the Hong Kong teacher education students tended to be autonomous and they characterized their s as authoritative instead of authoritarian. In addition, the emotional autonomy scale was positively related to authoritarianism, but negatively related to authoritativeness and permissiveness of . Emotional detachment instead of autonomy seemed to be a more appropriate meaning of EAS for the interpretation of . Implications were drawn for future  including development of an improved instrument in measuring emotional autonomy to  its associations with perceived   of young people across cultures."
Relationship between perceived parenting style with anxiety levels and loneliness in visually impaired  and adolescents,2016,"Background: Visual impairment is a risk factor for psychiatric disorders in the affected  and adolescents, but there are only a limited number of studies concerning the mental health characteristics of visually impaired  and adolescents. Objective: The aim of this  was to determine levels of loneliness and anxiety in visually impaired  and adolescents, to analyze   perceived by visually impaired  and adolescents, to compare those with typically controls. Methods: The  included 40  and adolescents with visually impairment and 34 control group without visual impairment. Sociodemographic data form, the UCLA loneliness scale, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children were used in both groups. The  Style Scale was used to determine perceived al attitudes. Results: This  found more loneliness and trait anxiety levels in visually impaired  and adolescents compared to the control group. Authoritative   was the most frequent type of al attitude in the visually impaired group. In visual impairment group, loneliness level was higher in subgroups of authoritative and permissive-indulgent  . However, level of trait anxiety was higher in authoritative   subgroup compared to the control group. Discussion: The  of this  showed higher loneliness and anxiety levels in visually impaired  and adolescents. Further studies are needed to determine psychopathological risks in this population."
"The role of parents' self-esteem, mastery-orientation and social background in their parenting styles",1999,"In order to examine the extent to which s' levels of education, financial resources, self-esteem, and their mastery-orientation versus task-avoidance are associated with their   and al stress, data from two studies were analyzed. In Study I, s of 105 6 to 7-year old  were asked to fill in scales measuring their   and al stress, mastery-orientation, financial resources, and their level of education. In Study II, 235 s were asked to fill in the same scales. An identical pattern of  was found in the two studies. s' self-esteem and their use of mastery-oriented strategy were found to be associated with authoritative  and low al stress, whereas s' low level of education was related to an authoritarian  . The  further showed that the impact of s' self-esteem on authoritative  and al stress was partly mediated by their use of a mastery-oriented strategy."
Perceptions of family relations when mothers and fathers are depicted with different parenting styles,2007,"College students (N = 125) reported their perceptions of family relations in response to vignettes that ed 5 different  . Participants viewed family relations as most positive when s were portrayed as authoritative or permissive and as most negative when s were portrayed as uninvolved-neglecting or authoritarian. Student gender and  gender effects qualified these findings. Female students reported family relations to be less positive than did male students when s were depicted as authoritarian or as uninvolved-neglecting, and they rated family relations more positively than did male students when s were depicted as permissive. Participants viewed family relations as more positive when mothers rather than fathers were ed as permissive and when fathers rather than mothers were depicted as authoritarian.

Parenting Style and Emotional Distress Among Chinese College Students: A Potential Mediating Role of the Zhongyong Thinking Style,2020,"Previous studies suggested that   was associated with college student's emotional distress. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of this relation in Chinese culture. The   investigated the associations between   and college student's emotional distress (depression and anxiety symptoms), examined the mediating effects of Confucian personality-Zhongyong thinking, and explored whether gender, age, and socioeconomic status (SES) moderated the direct and/or indirect effects of   on emotional distress. Results from a large reative sample of Chinese college students (n= 3943) indicated that (a) al rejection and overprotection was positively and mildly associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms and negatively and mildly related to Zhongyong thinking. al warmth significantly correlated with the three variables in the opposite direction; Zhongyong thinking correlated negatively and moderately with depression, and mildly with anxiety; (b) Zhongyong thinking partially mediated the associations of al rejection and warmth with emotional distress. Specifically, to the extent that students perceived less rejection and more warmth, they were more likely to develop Zhongyong thinking associated with decreased emotional distress; (c) gender and SES moderated the association between   and Zhongyong thinking. Specifically, for students with low SES, the negative relationship between al overprotection and Zhongyong thinking was stronger; for males and high SES students, the positive link between al warmth and Zhongyong thinking were stronger. Results highlight the importance of ing potential effects of college student's Zhongyong thinking within the family system in Chinese culture."
The Impact of Parenting Style on Attitudes toward Masturbation: A Latent Profile Analysis,2021,"s play a vital role in the development of their 's sexual attitudes and behaviors; however, little is known about the impact of  on masturbation attitudes. The   aimed to explore the role of discussions with s about attitudes toward masturbation. Additionally, latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to determine whether subgroups of exposure to distinct   exist, and if so, the extent to which they are related to the formation of masturbation attitudes. A convenience sample of 279 university students aged 18-21 completed an anonymous self-report survey. Participants who had not discussed masturbation with their s reported significantly more negative attitudes than those who had discussed it. In general, participants who perceived their s to be high in both rejection and control reported more negative attitudes toward masturbation than participants whose s were lower in rejection and lower in control. The LPA revealed three  profiles that were differentially related to young adults' masturbation attitudes: Permissive , Typical , and Authoritarian . An exploratory analysis found that female participants endorsed fewer negative attitudes toward masturbation than their male counterparts. Bayesian statistics were used to improve the interpretation of the data, allow for more meaningful and accurate conclusions, and provide converging evidence with the null hypothesis significance testing . Implications and limitations are discussed within the context of current masturbation and   ."
Personality traits and parenting styles in boys victims of sexual abuse: a pilot study,2021,"Objective: We examined the association between personality traits and   in boys victims of sexual abuse (SA). Methods: Sixty-two (62) boys were divided into two groups: 32 (Victims of SA group, age 11.7 +/- 1.28) and 30 non-victims of SA (Comparison group, age 11.6 +/- 1.22). All participants completed the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ-J) and the  Styles Inventory (PSI). The intelligence quotient (IQ) was  assessed. Results: Both groups did not differ in terms of IQ. In the SA group, men (97%) were the biggest abusers, 85% of the s were divorced and the father was the biggest aggressor (44%). The SA victims had higher neuroticism (p <0.001) and identified riskier al practices, while the comparison group reported good al practices (p<0.05). The  of the logistic regression analysis showed that higher negative paternal al  scores increase the chance of belonging to the victims group. Discussion: Victims of SA  a higher risk of neuroticism and perception of dysfunctional family dynamics, with seriously reversed social roles. Further studies are needed to investigate the behavioral, cognitive, emotional, personality and al , and the development of psychological intervention programs and other professional practices for victims of SA and their families in various contexts of violence."
"SOCIOECONOMIC BACKGROUND, MATERNAL PARENTING STYLE, AND THE LANGUAGE ABILITY OF FIVE- AND SIX-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN",2012,"We examined the pathways through which language ability components, such as reading and writing at the age of 5, and socioeconomic and environmental variables, such as maternal  , affect the language ability of  in the first grade. The focal point of this 's structural modeling analysis was that family socioeconomic factors of income and al education level directly affect 's vocabulary power and, through mothers'  , affect their language test scores at the age of 5. In turn, the scores of language tests done during a 's first grade year reflect the age 5 test scores. Thus, it was found that language ability is affected by socioeconomic factors. Results  indicate that, for young ,   has a great impact on hood language ability."
Understanding the relationship between parenting style and chronic pain in adolescents: a structural equation modelling approach,2021,"Background Although the context of  has been incorporated into psychosocial pain , very little attention has been paid to how   influence chronic pain in adolescents. The   aimed to investigate the mediating role of self-esteem, emotional intelligence, and psychological distress in the association between   and chronic pain. Method Seven hundred and thirty nine adolescents and their s participated in this . To identify adolescents with chronic pain, screening questions based on the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases were used. Baumrind   questionnaire was used to assess the   (permissive, authoritarian, and authoritative  ). The structural equation modelling (SEM) was carried out in M-Plus version 6 to evaluate the direct, indirect, and total effects of different   on chronic pain. Results The  in the SEM models revealed that only the indirect paths from authoritative and authoritarian   to pain through emotional intelligence (beta(authoritative) = - 0.003, 95% CI = - 0.008 to - 0.003; beta(authoritarian) = 0.001, 95% CI = 0.001 to 0.003) and psychological distress (beta(authoritative) = - 0.010, 95% CI = - 0.021 to - 0.004; beta(authoritarian) = 0.008, 95% CI = 0.004 to 0.016) were significant. Indirect paths from permissive  to pain and the mediating role of self-esteem were not significant. Discussion Emotional intelligence and psychological distress significantly mediated the effects of authoritative and authoritarian   on chronic pain. The current  support the notion that interventions targeting effective -adolescent communication may be an important part of chronic pain management in adolescents. Moreover, the  provide rationale for targeting emotional intelligence and psychological distress in adolescents by explicitly teaching effective communication skills, expressing opinions and minds, and emotion regulation strategies."
Parenting Stress and Social Style in Mothers and Fathers of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Cross-Cultural Investigation in Italy and Japan,2021,"s of  with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) face unique challenges, which may affect  functioning. However, little is known about gender and cultural variations in  stress and  in these families. The aims of this  were to investigate: (1a) the differences in  stress and (1b) social  between Italian and Japanese mothers and fathers of  with ASD; (2) the predictive role of culture, sociodemographic, and 's characteristics on  stress; (3) the predictors of the social  , including  stress dimensions. The  involved 92 Italians and 89 Japanese s of school-age  (5-12 years) with ASD who completed the  Stress Index and the  Style Questionnaire. Results revealed that Japanese s showed higher  stress and less engagement in social  than Italians. Across cultures, mothers used more social  than fathers. Being Japanese and having a  with greater ASD severity predicted higher levels of  stress. We  found that country, 's gender, and stress related to the dysfunctional interaction were significant predictors of  social . Our findings highlight the importance of a cross-cultural approach to better understand the experiences and needs of mothers and fathers of  with ASD."
Low-Wage Maternal Employment and Parenting Style,2008,"This three-year longitudinal  investigated whether low-wage employment was associated with improved psychological and  outcomes in a sample of 178 single mothers who were employed and Unemployed current and former welfare recipients both before and subsequent to the passage of the personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. Participation in employment predicted fewer depressive symptoms and less negative   over time. Employment at time I was associated with a reduced likelihood of receiving welfare in the interim between times I and 2, less Financial strain at time 2. and (through these) a decrease in mothers' depressive symptoms at time 2. Fewer depressive symptoms at time 2, in turn, predicted less negative  , net of the mothers earlier demographic, mental health, and  characteristics. Mothers with higher education attainment were more likely to be employed (and to earn more) at both time points. Implications of these findings for welfare policies are discussed."
Parenting Style and Cyber-Aggression in Chinese Youth: The Role of Moral Disengagement and Moral Identity,2021,"Previous  has shown that   is intricately linked to cyber-aggression. However, the underlying mechanisms of this relationship remain unclear, especially among young adults. Guided by the social cognitive theory and the ecological system theory, this  aimed to examine the effect of   on cyber-aggression, the potential mediating role of moral disengagement, and the moderating role of moral identity in this relationship. Participants comprised 1,796 Chinese college students who anonymously completed questionnaires on  , moral disengagement, moral identity, cyber-aggression, and demographic variables. After controlling for sex and age, al rejection and over-protection were positively related to cyber-aggression; however, al emotional warmth was non-significantly related to cyber-aggression. Mediation analysis revealed that   was related to cyber-aggressive behavior through moral disengagement. Moderated mediation analysis further indicated that the indirect effect of   on cyber-aggression was much stronger in college students with higher moral identity. The  carries important practical implications for s and educators concerned about the destructive consequences of cyber-aggression."
Which parenting style is more protective against adolescent substance use? Evidence within the European context,2014,"Background: This  examines whether authoritative   (characterized by warmth and strictness) is more protective against adolescent substances use than authoritarian (strictness but not warmth), indulgent (warmth but not strictness) and neglectful (neither warmth nor strictness)  . Emergent  in diverse cultural contexts (mainly Southern European and Latin American countries) questions the fact that authoritative would always be the optimum  . Design: Multi-factorial MANOVAs. Participants: A sample of 7718 adolescents, 3774 males (48.9%), 11-19 year-olds (M=14.63 year-olds, SD = 1.9 years) from Sweden, United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, Slovenia, and the Czech Republic. Measurements:   dimensions (warmth and strictness) and adolescent substance use (alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs); additionally another three adolescent outcomes were  measured (self-esteem, school performance and personal disturbances) all of them related in the literature with substance use. Findings: Both indulgent and authoritative   were associated with better outcomes than authoritarian and neglectful  in all the countries studied. Overall, our  support the idea that in Europe the indulgent   performs as well as the authoritative one since adolescents' scores in the youth outcomes were equal (on substance use and personal disturbances) or even better (on self esteem and school performance) than for authoritative  . Conclusions:   relate to substance use and other outcomes in the same way in different countries explored. The so-called indulgent   appears to be as good as the authoritative in protecting against substance abuse. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
Adult attachment style and maternal-infant bonding: the indirect path of parenting stress,2020,"Background: The quality of maternal-infant bonding is related to important  outcomes. The literature has assumed that the ability to form relationships is a relatively stable trait, and  studies have suggested that a mother's attachment  in close adult relationships is related to mother-infant bonding. The transition to hood is  often stressful, and the adult attachment  may relate to  stress in the first year after birth. Such stress could possibly have a negative relationship with the mother-infant bond. In the  , we examined the associations between maternal adult attachment  and the quality of mother-infant bonding and whether this relationship is mediated by  stress. Methods: The   sample comprised 168 women (mean age 31.0years, SD 4.23years). Between weeks 31 and 41 of gestation, the anxious and avoidant adult attachment dimensions were measured with the Experiences in Close Relationships questionnaire (ECR). Between 5 and 15weeks after birth mother-infant bonding and  stress were measured with the Maternal Postnatal Attachment Scale (MPAS) and the  Stress Index- Domain (PSI-PD), respectively. Results: Both attachment-related avoidance and attachment-related anxiety correlated significantly and negatively with mother-infant bonding. However, a regression analysis showed that only attachment-related avoidance was a significant predictor of mother-infant bonding when controlling for demographic variables and maternal mental health history. The relationship between the adult attachment  and bonding was mediated by  stress. Higher scores on attachment avoidance and anxiety were related to increased stress, which was related to decreased quality of bonding. The overall  domain and the subscale of competence in the -related stress dimension mediated between attachment avoidance and bonding, and the overall  domain and the subscales of competence and role restriction mediated between attachment anxiety and bonding. There was no direct relationship between the adult attachment  and mother-infant bonding when  stress was included as a mediator. Conclusions: This  illustrates that maternal adult attachment  relates to mother-infant bonding. This relationship was mediated by  stress. The  may have implications for the early identification of mothers at risk of having bonding difficulties."
The role of  negative affect in the relations between parenting styles and play,2006,"Interactions between   and 's negative affect in the prediction of reticent, solitary-active, and rough-and-tumble play behaviours were examined. The   involved 98 , their mothers and their preschool teachers. Participants (53 boys and 45 girls) were a mean age of 3.83 years (standard deviation = 0.69). Mothers completed questionnaires pertaining to their disciplinary rearing  and their 's negative affect. Preschool/ daycare teachers completed a measure concerning 's indoor-free play behaviours. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed two significant interactions between   and 's negative affect in the prediction of play behaviours. For example, it was found that emotion coaching  was negatively related to rough-and-tumble play for  low in negative affect but not for  high in negative affect. Implications of these findings, and others, are discussed in terms of goodness of fit, overprotective  and their overall importance for 's social development."
"Acculturation, Enculturation, Parental Adherence to Asian Cultural Values, Parenting Styles, and Family Conflict Among Asian American College Students",2010,"The   examined the relations between perceived   and family conflict with data from 149 Asian American college students. Ratings of   were highest for authoritarian , followed by authoritative and permissive . Tests of mediation revealed that authoritarian  significantly explained why s' adherence to Asian cultural values was associated with increased family conflict. Tests of moderation showed that as permissive  increased, more acculturated participants reported lower family conflict, although the reverse was true for their less acculturated counterparts. When authoritarian  increased, integrated, separated, and assimilated participants reported increased family conflict, whereas the marginalized group reported lower family conflict. Finally, assimilated participants reported less family conflicts at higher levels of authoritative  in comparison to the integrated, separated, and marginalized groups."
Association between Perceived Parenting Style and Adolescents' Attitudes toward Suicide,2020,"Objectives: Adolescent suicide, a major cause of adolescent death, is affected by various factors, including attitudes toward suicide. This  investigated the association between   and adolescents' attitudes toward suicide and the mediating role of attitude toward suicide between   and suicidal ideation. Methods: We surveyed 1,071 adolescents from eight middle schools in Incheon, Korea. The survey included sociodemographic information, attitudes toward suicide, perception of  , depression severity, and suicidality. Results: Students in the authoritarian  group had a more permissive attitude toward suicide compared with the democratic and permissive  groups. These students considered that suicide is justified in certain situations and that choosing suicide is an individual's right. They  had a negative attitude toward talking about suicide or intervening in others' suicide. This association remained statistically significant after adjusting for the impact of confounding factors that could affect attitudes toward suicide, except for suicidal processes and preparedness to prevent suicide. In the mediation analysis, we observed that some factors of the attitudes toward suicide mediated between authoritarian  attitudes and suicidal ideation, namely, suicide as a right, preventability, suicide as normal/common, preparedness to prevent suicide, and resignation. Conclusion: This  revealed the significant impact of   on 's attitudes toward suicide. Educating s about the appropriate  attitudes-sympathetic and rational-can help prevent youth suicide."
"DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONE EXPECTATIONS, PARENTING STYLES AND SELF-CONSTRUAL IN MALAYSIAN AND AUSTRALIAN CAREGIVERS",2013,"The  examined the developmental milestone expectations,   and self-construal of Malaysian and Anglo-Australian caregivers as determined by questionnaires. Malaysian caregivers scored significantly higher on interdependent self-construal and Authoritarian   than Anglo-Australian caregivers. In terms of developmental milestones, Malaysian caregivers expected a later age of attainment for these milestones than Anglo-Australians for three of the six developmental domains: compliance, peer interaction and verbal skills. Malaysians had later age expectancies for individual competencies than Anglo-Australians for 19 of the 45 competencies. Malaysians had earlier expectations than Anglo-Australians for five of the competencies. These  are congruent with the values associated with individualist cultures, in which high value is placed on independence, autonomy and early mastery of developmental milestones."
"Social anxiety disorder in Saudi adolescent boys: Prevalence, subtypes, and parenting style as a risk factor",2016,"Background: Available information on social anxiety disorder (SAD) in adolescents in Saudi Arabia is limited. The objective of the  was to estimate the prevalence, severity, and subtypes of SAD, and   risk factors associated with SAD in the adolescent. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional  was conducted in two secondary schools for boys in Abha, Saudi Arabia during the Academic year 2013. To collect the data, a questionnaire eliciting information on background characteristics and   as well as the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale Test (LSAS), for the evaluation of SAD, were used. Results: A total of 454 students participated in the . The age of the participants ranged between 15 and 20 years with a mean of 17.4 years. The prevalence of SAD was 11.7%. Around 36% and 11.4% of the students respectively had severe and more severe forms of SAD.   such as al anger, criticism particularly in front of others, exaggerated protection, maltreatment and family provocation emerged as a significant risk factor for SAD. The independent predictors of SAD were a al provocation and physical or emotional maltreatment by the  (odds ratio [OR] = 3.97, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.90-8.31 and OR = 2.67, 95% CI: 3.17-5.19, respectively). Conclusion: The prevalence of SAD in secondary school students at Abha is high.   risk factors for SAD are modifiable. In this context, a national program to improve mental health in this age group is crucial."
The impact of perception of consistency and inconsistency in parenting style on pro-social motives of adolescents,2017,"Adolescence is the most dynamic and eventful period of human development. During this crucial period of life, adolescents encounter challenges in life and constantly adapting to the relationship dynamics with friends, family, school and society. There is tendency of adolescents to engage in antisocial or pro-social behaviour. Adolescents' relationship with s and guardian significantly influence their antisocial and prosocial behavior. Pro-social behavior is defined as a behavior that is primarily aimed at benefiting others. Some pro-social behaviour is extrinsically motivated whereas some are intrinsically motivated. The   investigated the nature of prosocial behaviour among adolescents and impact of consistency and inconsistency of   on prosocial behaviour. A group of 610 adolescents (310 boys and 300 girls) aged between 16-18 years (mean = 17.07 and standard deviation = 1.02) was selected for the  . Pro-social Motivation Questionnaire and al Authority Questionnaire were used to measure pro-social motive and  , respectively. The  indicate that adolescents generally show higher level of intrinsic prosocial motive. Adolescent girls prefer to display internalised and empathetic prosocial motives whereas adolescent boys tend to gain others' approval by displaying heroic activities. Consistency in   facilitates intrinsic pro-social motive only when both s are authoritative in nature. The  interestingly reveals that inconsistent   is not always bad. Authoritative and permissive dyad facilitates intrinsic pro-social motive among adolescents. Implications for al socialisation in families and pro-social motive among adolescents are discussed."
Cultural values as mediators between parenting styles and bullying behavior at school,2018,"The purpose of this  was to examine the relationship between  , cultural values and bullying behavior at school. The main objective was to test the mediating role of cultural values in these relationships. The participants were 985 pre-adolescents, aged 10-12 years old (M = 10.95, SD = .75) from Cyprus and Greece who completed the al Authority Questionnaire, the Cultural Values Scale and the Bullying Victimization Questionnaire. Structural equation models were applied to test the interrelations between the latent factors. It was found that horizontal individualism was positively related to victimization, whereas vertical individualism was positively related to bullying. Furthermore, cultural values partially mediated the relationships between al  and bullying behavior. The contextual mechanisms explaining bullying and victimization were similar for males and females. The findings support the contextual conceptualization of bullying and point out the need to consider the mediating role of cultural values in order to understand the differential pathways between familial factors and  outcomes."
Differential Effect of Mothers' and Fathers' Parenting Style on Teenagers' Physical Self-concept,2015,"Self-concept is a person's perception of their physical self in the context of their life experiences. This  is aimed at getting to know the relationship between mothers' and fathers' teenager-perceived  , on one hand, and each of the dimensions of physical self-concept (physical endurance, general self-esteem, coordination, general physical self-concept, etc.) Six hundred 12-18-year-old students from 12 secondary education centres took part in this . The al Bonding Instrument by Parker, Tupling & Brown (1979), as well as a shortened version of the Physical Self Description Questionnaire by Marsh, Martin & Jackson (2010), were used. Factor analysis was completed to assess response validity. Besides, multivariate and univariate variance analyses were used to identify which physical self-concept dimensions differ according to  educational approach and teenager gender. Results show that 33.7, 16.8, 17.1 and 32.4% of the mothers were perceived by teenagers as permissive, democratic, negligent and authoritarian, respectively. Among fathers, these values were 32.0, 19.2, 15.7 and 33.1%, respectively. In general, higher values associated to the 11 dimensions of the physical self-concept were observed among boys than girls. The lowest values were found among teenagers who perceive authoritarian  in their s' educational . Therefore, teenagers who perceive a permissiveness   are concluded to get better physical self-concept  than those who perceive an authoritative  . Besides, the possible negative impact of neglecting and authoritative  on physical self-concept is observed to be stronger among mothers than fathers. The implications that lack of affection and excessive control may have on the formation of appropriate self-concept in teenagers are discussed."
Predictors of obesity and overweight in preschoolers: The role of parenting styles and feeding practices,2018,"Childhood obesity/overweight (OB/OW) displayed a rapid increase and high prevalence in the last few decades in preschool-aged , which raised health concerns across the world and motivated ers to investigate the factors that underlie hood obesity. The current  examined   and -feeding practices as potential predictors for OB/OW in preschool , controlling for 's temperament, which has been shown to be linked with OB/OW. The sample included 61 normal weight (NW) and 61 obese/overweight (OB/OW) Turkish pre-schoolers (M age = 62.2 months; SD = 7.64, range = 45-80 months).   (authoritarian, authoritative), -feeding practices (restriction, pressure to eat, monitoring), and 's temperament (negative affectivity) were measured with mothers' reports. Results showed that authoritarian  and maternal pressure to eat were the two  variables that significantly predicted 's weight status; the odds of being OB/OW was 4.71 times higher in  whose mothers used higher authoritarian  , and was 0.44 times lower when mothers pressured their  to eat. These findings suggest that understanding the unique role of different aspects of  in the risk of early OB/OW status of  would be important in developing more effective interventions from early years in life.

The relations between perceived parenting styles and academic achievement in Hong Kong: The mediating role of students' goal orientations,2015,"This  examined the relations between perceived  , goal orientations, and academic achievement among Chinese students. A survey was conducted among 339 university students in Hong Kong to collect information on their perceptions of  , goal orientations, and grade point averages. Using structural equation modeling, the  suggested that perceived authoritative  was related to Chinese students' mastery goals and performance-approach goals, which in turn contributes positively to their academic achievement. Perceived authoritarian  was found to be positively associated with academic achievement by shaping Chinese students' performance-approach goals and negatively with academic achievement by shaping Chinese students' performance-avoidance goals. Cultural factors and considerations are addressed to clarify the findings of the . (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
The Relationship Between Perceived Parenting Style and Emotion Regulation Abilities in Adulthood,2018,"Emotion regulation abilities are very important for psychological and social wellbeing during the whole course of life. By contrast, emotion dysregulation is a significant risk factor for several psychological disorders. According to developmental , an optimal  , described as warmth and affectionate, promotes the development of an adequate emotion regulation in  and adolescents. However, little  has examined the relationship between   and emotion regulation in adulthood. In the  , we tested the relationship between perceived experiences with s, in terms of al care and al overprotection, during hood, and emotion regulation abilities in a sample of adults. One hundred participants completed the al Bonding Instruments, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that perceived al care was more related to emotion regulation abilities than perceived al overprotection. In particular, perceived paternal care was strictly linked to several difficulties in emotion regulation. By contrast, perceived maternal care was negatively associated with the use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, and a specific emotion dysregulation dimension, that is lack of emotional awareness. In summary, perceived al care seemed to have a key role to protect individuals from emotion dysregulation. These  demonstrate that   still exert their influence on emotion regulation abilities  in adulthood. Limitations and directions for future  are discussed."
Control or involvement? Relationship between authoritative parenting style and adolescent depressive symptomatology,2012,"Among factors predicting adolescent mood problems, certain aspects of the -adolescent relationship play an important role. In previous studies,  whose s had an authoritative  of  reported the best behavioral and psychological outcomes. Therefore, the main goal of this paper was to investigate the role of authoritative   and other family variables (negative family interactions and positive identification with s) in adolescents' depressive symptomatology. The  was carried out in all primary and secondary schools in Mako and the surrounding region in Hungary in the spring of 2010, students of grades 7-12 (N = 2,072): 49.2% of the sample were males; 38.1% primary school pupils; and 61.9% high school students. Self-administered questionnaires contained items of measuring depressive symptoms (CDI) and al variables beyond sociodemographics. Beyond descriptive statistics and calculation of correlation coefficients, multiple linear regression analyses were applied to detect relationships between al variables and depressive scores by gender. Overall, our data support a negative association between authoritative   and adolescent mood problems, particularly among girls. Among boys, only mother's responsiveness was a significant predictor. Among girls, father's  played a decisive role; not only his responsiveness but  demandingness. Interestingly, mother's demandingness went together with an elevated depressive score for girls. Prevention programs cannot guarantee success without taking into account the role of s. Teaching positive  seems to be a part of these prevention programs that may include facilitating intimate yet autonomous relationships."

In doing so, we  seek to strengthen inferences regarding the experiential underpinnings of previously obtained relationships among these variables by determining if they  occur in families where s and  are not biologically related. Participants were families of 133 preschool-age adopted Chinese girls (M-age = 5.2 years, SD = 0.7; M-age (at) (adoption) = 12.8 months, SD = 4.1). Data on family stress,  , and 's behavioral adjustment were collected from the adoptive mothers with the Social Problem Questionnaire (SPQ),  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ), and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) respectively. Results showed that adoptive mothers reported relatively mild family stress, frequent authoritative , and few behavior problems in their . Nonetheless, family stress, authoritarian and permissive   positively correlated with 's behavioral problems. Finally, authoritarian  mediated the effect of non--related family stress (NCR-stress) on the adopted Chinese girls' CBCL internalizing and overall problems, even after controlling for corresponding CBCL scores from 2 years earlier.

A search for parenting style: A cross-situational analysis of parental behavior,2001,"Cross-situational stability in s' emotional warmth and guidance was studied by observing s (N = 77, M age = 38 years) with their school-aged  in 2 dyadic problem-solving situations and in a family discussion concerning a moral dilemma. The observational data were coded by independent observers using dimensional ratings and dichotomous frequency counts as the 2 coding procedures. These procedures yielded a similar pattern of findings. s tended to behave consistently across situations, although the type of situation did affect the amount of emotional warmth and guidance manifested by the . Stability was further analyzed by means of structural equation modeling to test whether variance in s' emotional warmth and guidance across situations was attributable to a generalized   factor. A  Style factor was identified that reflected the s' -centeredness; this factor explained, in part, al behavior within each situation, although contextual factors  contributed to situation-specific variations from task to task."

Results showed that 's expressive HL proficiency and s' American and heritage cultural orientations were positively associated with authoritative , which in turn was associated with 's lower externalizing problems and higher prosocial behaviors. Children's expressive EL was negatively associated with s' use of authoritarian , and both expressive and receptive HL were negatively associated with 's expressed sadness. These  indicate that 's HL development and s' host and heritage cultural orientations are associated with socioemotional benefits for young DLLs growing up in low-income immigrant families."

Perceived Parenting Style of Fathers and Iranian Adolescents' Self-efficacy: The Moderating Role of Gender and Education,2017,"The authors examined the moderating role of adolescent's gender and father's education on the associations between perceived paternal   and self-efficacy in a socioeconomical diverse sample of Iranian ado-lescents (n = 382). Results revealed that paternal authoritative  was significantly and positively related to self-efficacy. Interestingly, a significant and positive relation was  found between paternal authoritarian  and self-efficacy. This finding might have been the  of the fact that this  was conducted as part of a collectivist culture. In addition, the  indicated that boys who perceived their fathers as highly authoritative indicated higher self-efficacy than girls did. Furthermore, the findings demonstrated that higher educational levels attenuate the negative impact of the permissive   on self-efficacy. The  findings underscore the need to focus on the role of gender and father's education when assessing the link between   and adolescents' self-efficacy."

Participants were 3169 Taiwanese junior high school students ages 13-16. Results exhibited a dominance of both authoritative and authoritarian IPSs. Boys tended to perceive a permissive or neglectful IPS from their s, while girls tended to perceive an authoritarian or authoritative IPS. IE and control had a consistent positive direct relationship with IAT across all IPS models. The hypothesized indirect effect was significant for the authoritarian  model from control to IAT and for the neglectful  model from both warmth and control to IAT. The   implied that the quality of Internet  behaviors as demonstrated by different IPSs may be related with changes in students' IE and IAT. Evidence from 's amount of Internet use, their gender, and al education level provided additional support on the  findings. The   would shed light on the role of family function on students' Internet use and provide suggestions on Internet  to reduce possible IAT."
"CORPORAL PUNISHMENT, SELF-CONTROL, PARENTING STYLE, AND SCHOOL BULLYING AMONG CHINESE ADOLESCENTS: A CONDITIONAL PROCESS ANALYSIS",,"Research on generational transmission of violence suggests that al corporal punishment in Western countries often leads to violent behavior among . Violence begets violence, to most Western rearing scholars. However, the socio-cultural context within which corporal punishment is administrated matters and often produces unexpected consequences. Utilizing a sample (N = 2,075) from six middle schools in central China, we employed a series of conditional process analysis to assess the mediating effect of self-control and moderating effect of   in the relations of corporal punishment and physical bullying. Our findings show that al corporal punishment was not always associated with physical bullying in school. Its impact on physical bullying was moderated by the   within which it is applied. Authoritative  would protect  from elevated physical bullying perpetration even when they were physically punished. Self-control mediated the relations of corporal punishment and physical bullying only among boys raised by rejecting  and girls raised by indulgent and rejecting .

Do tiger moms raise superior kids? The impact of parenting style on adolescent human capital formation in China,2020,"How   influences human capital accumulation is an important yet under-ed topic in the economics literature.

Following the mainstream approach in development psychology, the measurement of   is constructed from two dimensions - demandingness and responsiveness, and further classified into four types: authoritative, authoritarian, permissive and neglectful. We find that both demandingness and responsiveness of s have positive effects on 's academic performance, while s' responsiveness play a substantial role in the formation of 's cognitive skills (measured by the standardized cognitive skill tests) as well as socio-emotional skills (measured by mental health, self-confidence, motivation and extraversion). Putting together, the authoritative   characterized by high demandingness and high responsiveness is associated with the best outcome measures among the four  types in cultivating 's human capital formation. Moreover, we find that student time-allocation, extracurricular activities and -teacher interactions may serve as important channels of the  influences, and that there exist moderate interactive effects between fathers' and mothers' influences and between the demandingness and responsiveness of  ."

The role of retrospectively perceived parenting style and adult attachment behaviour in music performance anxiety,2020,"This  aimed to examine the extent to which music performance anxiety relates to retrospectively perceived   and adult attachment behaviour. Participants were 82 music students (M-age= 23.5 years,SD= 3.4) with the majority being vocal (30.5%), string (24.4%) or piano (19.5%) students each with about 20 performance opportunities per year. Music performance anxiety was assessed using the German version of the Kenny Music Performance Anxiety Inventory.   was measured by retrospective self-report using the German version of the Measure of  Style, adult attachment behaviour by the Relationship Questionnaire based on Bartholomew's four-category model. Furthermore, general anxiety-related symptoms were assessed by the Severity Measure for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Canonical and partial canonical correlation analyses were used to measure the dependence between multi-dimensional constructs: Both   and adult attachment behaviour were related to music performance anxiety as measured by a performance-related sub-scale of the Kenny Music Performance Anxiety Inventory (r= 0.45,p= 0.01 andr= 0.37,p= 0.02, respectively). The partial canonical correlation analysis, however, showed no significant relations between music performance anxiety and   or adult attachment behaviour. A strong link of music performance anxiety and generalised anxiety was found in all analyses. This  expands on more theoretical  in this area and provides first empirical insight into this complex multi-dimensional relationship."

A MANOVA (4 x 2 x 4) with  , sex and age as independent variables was applied. Personal adjustment criteria were emotional and physical self-concept, and nervousness, while social adjustment criteria were internalization of social values and hostile sexism. The indulgent and authoritative   showed better socialization outcomes in all adjustment criteria across all  ages. However,  from indulgent families scored higher on emotional self-concept and lower on hostile sexism and nervousness than those from authoritative families. These findings seriously question whether strictness  dimension is necessary not only during the al socialization (for adolescent ) but  beyond adolescence (for adult ), once al socialization is over."

Teachers completed Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. The  of structural equation modelling showed indirect effects of authoritarian  and al indifference/neglect (but not authoritative  and al warmth/affection) on 's EBP through themediation of 's EF deficits. Additionally, analyses revealed both direct and indirect effects of al hostility/aggression on 's EBP through the mediation of 's EF deficits. The  suggests that EF deficits contribute to social difficulties of  whose s exhibit high levels of negative   and practices. The  indicates that interventions should be aimed at ' s EF training programmes."
Perceived parenting styles and body appreciation among Chinese adolescents: Exploring the mediating roles of dispositional mindfulness and self-compassion,2020,"Purpose: Previous studies suggested that  , dispositional mindfulness and self-compassion were associated with body image. However, these constructs have not been examined together in any ; consequently, the relationship pattern of these constructs is largely unknown, especially about how some of these constructs are related to one positive aspect of body image (e.g., body appreciation). The   examined the association between adolescents' perceived   and body appreciation and explored whether such association was mediated by mindfulness and self-compassion. Method: A sample of 455 middle school students (203 males, 248 females; aged from 12 to 15 years old) participated in the current . They completed a battery of questionnaires assessing  , dispositional mindfulness, self-compassion, and body appreciation. Path analysis was used to test the proposed mediating model. Results: The  revealed that   were significantly related to body appreciation, and the relationships between   of overprotection and emotional warmth and body appreciation could be partially mediated by self-compassion, but not by dispositional mindfulness. Discussion: The  suggest that   and self-compassion might be important contributing factors for body appreciation among Chinese adolescents; however, future studies are warranted to further examine the causal effects of  , dispositional mindfulness, and self-compassion on adolescents' body appreciation.

"Maternal and paternal parenting styles in adolescence and its relationship with resilience, attachment and bullying involvement.",2015,"The   has two aims. The first is to create a typology of  , and the second is to explore the relationship between mother's and father's   and the coherence between both, and adolescent adjustment, assessed with the bullying involvement, resilience and attachment. It has been used an incidental sample of 626 high school students (49.7% girls) from Cordoba, who completed the Scale to assessment maternal and paternal  stile in adolescence, the European Bullying Intervention Project Questionnaire, the attachment scale CaMir-R and the short version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. The  show four  , which are the same for mothers and fathers (supervisor democratic, controlling democratic, democratic of little disclosure and moderately) and one   only for mothers (permissive) and other, only for fathers (indifferent). It was found statistically significant differences in all measures of adolescent adjustment depending on mother's and father's al  and the coherence between both. The better psychosocial adjustment was observed in adolescents whose father or mother were supervisor democratic and when both s were democratic."
"Authoritative Parenting, Parenting Stress, and Self-Care in Pre-Adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes",2012," involvement in type 1 diabetes (T1DM) care leads to improved adherence; however, the manner in which s approach illness management interactions with  must  be considered. It was hypothesized that greater use of an authoritative   and less  stress would be associated with greater behavioral adherence and better metabolic control. Ninety-five primary caregivers of preadolescents (ages 8-11) with T1DM completed questionnaires assessing  , pediatric  stress, and  behavioral adherence. Caregivers primarily self-identified as using an authoritative  . Greater authoritative  was associated with greater behavioral adherence and less difficulty with pediatric  stress; no differences in metabolic control were observed. Greater engagement in authoritative  behaviors may contribute to increased age-appropriate  behavioral adherence and less pediatric  stress. Interventions highlighting diabetes-specific authoritative  techniques may enhance health outcomes and improve overall family functioning."
Exploring the relation between parenting style and 's self-concept and subjective and objective metacognition,2021,"Objective. To examine the relationship between   (of mothers and fathers), 's self-concept, and subjective and objective measures of metacognition, and to investigate whether self-concept and   predicted metacognition. Methodology. A convenience sample of 196 students who belong to an official educational institution was used; this  implemented a quantitative correlational design. The   used a series of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models to examine the extent to which mothers' and fathers'   as well as 's self-concept predicted 's subjective metacognitive awareness and objective metacognitive monitoring. Results.   predicted metacognition in three learning domains (reading comprehension, mathematics, and similarities), although in different ways. Furthermore, 's self-concepts  predicted metacognition in all three domains. Conclusion. Education must extend beyond school and  to include family. These educational outreach efforts should incorporate more than just how family life affects learning outcomes, such as 's performance in academic domains, but  how family life affects 's metacognitive abilities."
The Role of Life Satisfaction and Parenting Styles in Predicting Delinquent Behaviors among High School,2012,"The purpose of this  is to determine whether the   and life satisfaction predict delinquent behaviors frequently or not.

Results show that all   differed across Arab societies. Cluster analysis revealed three combined  patterns: inconsistent (permissive and authoritarian), controlling (authoritarian and authoritative), and flexible (authoritative and permissive). The mean score of the authoritarian  was higher among males, whereas the mean score of the authoritative  was higher among females. First-born adolescents reported higher level permissive  than other adolescents. The effects of urbanization, s' education, and the family economic level on  were minor."
Don't trust anyone over 30: Parental legitimacy as a mediator between parenting style and changes in delinquent behavior over time,2012,"Both law and society scholars and developmental psychologists have focused on the legitimacy of authority figures, although in different domains (police versus s). The purpose of the current  is to bridge these two fields by examining the relations among   (i.e., authoritarian, authoritative, permissive), the perception of al legitimacy, and changes in delinquency over time. It is hypothesized that al legitimacy mediates the relation between   and future delinquent behavior. Middle school and high school students completed questionnaires three times over a period of 18 months.   and delinquent behavior were measured at time 1, al legitimacy at time 2, and delinquency again at time 3. The  show that authoritative  was positively related to al legitimacy, while authoritarian  was negatively associated with al legitimacy. Furthermore, al legitimacy was negatively associated with future delinquency. Structural equation modeling indicated that al legitimacy mediated the relation between   and changes in delinquency over the 18-month time period. The implications for   and al legitimacy affecting delinquent behavior are discussed. (C) 2011 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Influence of Positive Parenting Styles on Self-Regulated Learning in Chinese Adolescents Testing the Mediating Effects of Self-Esteem,,"The positive   and the self-esteem of the s are two factors that affect Self-regulated learning (SRL). Moreover, the variable of self-esteem is influenced by the positive  . However, previous studies have investigated only the cross-sectional relationship between positive   and SRL and that between positive   and self-esteem. This  explored the relationship between positive   and self-regulated learning in Chinese adolescents and verified the mediating role of self-esteem in this relationship. The  used the panel data of 1180 1 adolescents (age, 10-15 years) from the 2014 China Family Panel Studies. The main variables were positive  , self-esteem, and SRL. The  showed that self-esteem plays a partial, but significant, mediating role in the relationship between s' positive   and adolescents' SRL ability. This  emphasised that self-esteem is a variable that influences the SRL ability. The more active the s are, the better the SRL ability of the adolescents is. Positive   have been proven to promote self-esteem development and can affect the SRL ability of adolescents."
The parenting style as protective or risk factor for substance use and other behavior problems among Spanish adolescents,2013,"The aim of this  was to analyze the al socialization  as a protective or a risk factor for substance use in a sample of 673 Spanish adolescents (51.7% were women) aged 14-17 (M = 15.49, SD = 1.06). All participants completed the al Socialization Scale ( ESPA29) and a scale of substance use. Additionally, they  completed a scale of delinquency and another one of school misconduct. A multivariate (4x2x2) analysis of variance (MANOVA) was applied for substance use, delinquency and school misconduct with  , sex and age. Results from this  showed that indulgent   was a protective factor for substance use whereas authoritarian  was identified as a risk factor. Moreover,  from protective and risk   on delinquency and school misconduct were consistent with those obtained on substance use. These findings have important implications for the development of family-based substance use prevention programs among Spanish adolescents and other similar cultures where indulgent   is currently displaying a beneficial impact."

Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was performed to explore the mediation effect of   between family resilience and psychosocial adjustment among  with chronic illness. Results: s of  with chronic illness reported lower level of family resilience and authoritative , but more peer relationship problems compared to s of healthy . SEM showed that authoritative  fully mediated the relationship between family resilience and psychosocial adjustment of  with chronic illness. Conclusion: Childhood chronic illness reduces family resilience, authoritative  and 's psychosocial adjustment, but authoritative  mediated these effects, so authoritative  may be important for family resilience in families of  with chronic illness. Pediatric clinicians and nurses should provide family-centered interventions, as well as  training, to improve 's psychosocial outcomes."
Child Feeding and Parenting Style Outcomes and Composite Score Measurement in the 'Feeding Healthy Food to Kids Randomised Controlled Trial',2016,"Child feeding practices and   each have an impact on  dietary intake, but it is unclear whether they influence each other or are amenable to change. The aims of this  were to measure  feeding and   in the Feeding Healthy Food to Kids (FHFK) Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) and test a composite  feeding score and a composite   score. Child feeding and   data from 146 - dyads (76 boys, aged 2.0-5.9 years) in the FHFK  were collected over a 12-month intervention.   was measured using  questions from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children and the Child Feeding Questionnaire (CFQ) was used to measure  feeding practices. Data for both measures were collected at baseline, 3 and 12 months and then modelled to develop a composite  feeding score and a  score. Multivariate mixed effects linear regression was used to measure associations between variables over time. All  feeding domains from the CFQ were consistent between baseline and 12 months (p < 0.001), except for monitoring (0.12, p = 0.44). All   domain scores were consistent over 12 months (p < 0.001), except for overprotection (0.22, p = 0.16). A significant correlation (r = 0.42, p < 0.0001) existed between  feeding score and   score within the FHFK RCT. In conclusion, composite scores have potential applications in the analysis of relationships between  feeding and dietary or anthropometric data in intervention studies aimed at improving  feeding or  . These applications have the potential to make a substantial contribution to the understanding of  feeding practices and  , in relation to each other and to dietary intake and health outcomes amongst pre-school aged ."
Attachment and Parenting Styles in Adolescents with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder,2019,"INTRODUCTION: Children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) experience problems with adults, especially with their s, due to self-regulation deficiencies involving impulse control, self-restraint and inhibition problems. It is  reported that problems in al attitudes play an important role in increasing the severity of ADHD findings. Because of these two conditions, we thought that there may be a relationship between attachment patterns and   of adolescents with ADHD. METHODS: 59 adolescents with ADHD and 66 adolescents without any psychopathology were included in the . Socio-demographic data form and Adolescent Relationship Scales Questionnaire were applied to participants and al Attitude Research Instrument was applied to their s. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in attachment  between ADHD and control group. s of the ADHD group had significantly higher scores in the subscales of rejection of the homemaking role, marital conflict, and strict discipline than s of the control group. Higher levels of dismissing attachment  were associated with higher strict discipline attitudes in the ADHD group. DISCUSSION and CONCLUSION: Our  suggests that evaluation of attachment characteristics and al attitudes in ADHD that is a neurodevelopmental disorder, may be necessary as an integrated approach."
Raising Children with Poor School Performance: Parenting Styles and Short- and Long-Term Consequences for Adolescent and Adult Development,2019,"This  examines the correlates of authoritative (warmth and strictness), indulgent (warmth but not strictness), authoritarian (strictness but not warmth), and neglectful (neither warmth nor strictness)  with short- and long-term socialization outcomes in adolescents and adults, with and without poor school performance during adolescence. Short- and long-term socialization outcomes were captured by multidimensional self-esteem (academic/professional, emotional, and family), psychological maturity (self-competence, social competence, and empathy), and emotional maladjustment (nervousness, emotional instability, and hostility). Participants (1195 female and 874 male) consisted of a community sample of adolescents (n = 602), young adults (n = 610), middle-aged adults (n = 469) and older adults (n = 388). Design was a 4 x 3 x 2 x 4 MANOVA (  x school performance x sex x age). Results indicated that the relationship between   and 's socialization outcomes does not vary as a function of school performance. The link between   and socialization outcomes shares a common short- and long- term pattern in adolescents and adults: Indulgent  was related to equal or even better socialization outcomes than authoritative , whereas authoritarian and neglectful  were associated with the worst socialization outcomes."
"Dimensions of parenting styles, social climate, and bullying victims in primary and secondary education",2018,"Background: Bullying as a construct is found to be related to a variety of individual, al and academic factors.

Longitudinal associations between parenting style and adolescent disordered eating behaviors,2015,"Purpose The main purpose of this  was to identify the longitudinal association between specific   (authoritarian, authoritative, permissive, and neglectful) and adolescent disordered eating behaviors. Methods The current  uses longitudinal data from a 5-year  to examine the associations between   and disordered eating behaviors among adolescents. Data from adolescents (n = 2516) participating in Project EAT (Eating Among Teens), a population-based  from 31 Minnesota schools, were used in the analysis. Time 1 data were collected using in-class assessments of adolescents from Minneapolis/St. Paul schools, and Time 2 data were collected using mailed surveys 5 years later. General Linear Models were used to predict adolescent-reported disordered eating behaviors at Time 2 from adolescent-reported   at Time 1. Results Adolescent boys and girls who had authoritarian mothers at Time 1 had a higher probability of extreme weight control behaviors 5 years later compared to adolescents with authoritative, permissive, or neglectful mothers. Adolescent girls with authoritarian mothers at Time 1 had a higher probability of engaging in binge-eating behaviors at Time 2 compared to adolescent girls with authoritative or permissive mothers. There were no significant associations between paternal   and adolescent disordered eating behaviors. Although authoritarian   served as a possible risk factor for disordered eating behaviors in adolescents, the findings were not conclusive. Conclusion Future studies should investigate further the association between   and weight control behaviors in adolescents."

The findings offer six criteria for evaluating different familial surveillance climates, organizing them in a three-tier model that demonstrates the multidimensionality of digital al surveillance. Consequently, the  challenges the presumed link between al surveillance and strict   (e.g., authoritarian, helicopter). Acknowledging the increasing normalization of digital al surveillance, the  advances a balanced and pragmatic view of this trend while illuminating participatory methods of implementing what is often considered a suppressive practice."
Influence of Parenting Styles and Peer Attachment on Life Satisfaction Among Adolescents: Mediating Role of Self-Esteem,,"Both  and peer relationship are essential in the formation of self-esteem among the adolescents which lead to overall psychological development. Life satisfaction is another outcome that describes the subjective well-being of any person and the quality of one's life. Literature has already suggested the importance of  and peer relationships in the development of self-esteem which may lead to life satisfaction among adolescents. However, the relationship between three  of  as well as peer attachment and life satisfaction mediated by self-esteem seems to be missing from the literature. This work is an important attempt toward fulfilling this  gap with respect to adolescents. The data were collected from 500 respondents which ed in 412 functional responses. Structural equation modeling method was used to test the relationship in the . The  revealed that both authoritative and permissive  have a positive influence on self-esteem in comparison to the negative influence of authoritarian . Peer attachment  has an affirmative impact on self-esteem. Self-esteem  positively influences life satisfaction. Mediation  revealed that self-esteem partially mediates the association between three  , peer attachment, and life satisfaction. This  may offer unique insights to family counselors, couple counselors, and family educators about the role of different   and peer attachment with respect to the development of 's self-esteem and life satisfaction.

Underpinnings of Internet Parenting Styles: The Development and Validation of the Internet Parenting Scale Using Repeated Cross-Sectional Studies,2018,"The overwhelming majority of s tend to mediate their 's Internet use via different Internet  . Recent  suggests that Internet  is closely related to the Internet use behavior, development, and well-being of young people. However, despite this, little prior  has investigated the different Internet   exercised by s in the developing world. Similarly, the recent literature has  pointed out the urgent need to develop new empirical measures of Internet . This open  gap is addressed by developing a 10-item scale measuring 4 types of Internet  , namely al encouragement, al permission, al worry, and al monitoring, using a 3-stage investigation involving repeated cross-sectional surveys. The prior Internet  literature exclusively focused on developed countries in the West and Far East, while developing countries have rarely been studied. The   has addressed this gap by recruiting adolescent and young-adult Internet users from India. The   suggest that the Internet  scale has a stable factorial structure, and sufficient instrument validity and reliability over time. Furthermore, it is  valid for adolescents attending public schools and young-adult Internet users. This  offers different theoretical and practical implications for ers engaged in interdisciplinary  on the Internet and youth."
Perceived Parenting Styles and Cultural Influences in Adolescent's Anxiety: A Cross-Cultural Comparison,2016,"A growing body of literature links particular  practices with negative  outcomes including greater anxiety symptoms among western societies.

This  therefore aimed to examine the relationship between perceived   and anxiety among Malay, Chinese, Indian, Arab and European/American (Caucasian) origins adolescents and the possible cultural group influences on this relationship was studied. Using multiple cluster sampling, a total of 227 students (122 boys and 105 girls) aged 13-18 years was selected. They completed questionnaires measuring al rearing behaviors (EMBU-C) and anxiety symptoms scale (SCAS). Results indicated that in comparison to the European/American; Asian samples reported greater anxiety symptoms on all subscales of anxiety. al rejection, anxious rearing and control/over protection were correlated to higher anxiety independent of cultural group but these associations were stronger for Caucasians.   as predictor of anxiety were found to be cross culturally different. Although European/American adolescents rated their s as least over controlling, it was significant predictor of anxiety. This  provides evidence for the notion that relationship between  factors and anxiety were different across cultural contexts."

The   aimed to investigate the self-reported different   in hood and adolescence and associated cognitive and affective empathy among offenders. Men incarcerated in prison in Jiangsu Province in China were invited to participate. Each consenting participant was asked to complete the al Bonding Instrument to collect information regarding the   they experienced in hood and adolescence and the Interpersonal Reactivity Index to evaluate their empathy. A multivariable linear regression analysis was conducted to explore the associations between different   and the empathy of offenders, and a one-way multivariate analysis of variance and a t-test were used to explore the differences in cognitive and affective empathy with different degrees of  . The al care and control factors in hood and adolescence were significantly more strongly associated with empathy among offenders than the al encouragement factor. There were different associations between the al care and control factors and offenders' empathy depending on whether the   were consistent or inconsistent. When the   were consistent, different degrees of al care had a significant predictive effect on cognitive and affective empathy, while different degrees of al control were only significantly associated with affective empathy among the offenders. When the   were inconsistent, different degrees of paternal and maternal control were associated with cognitive and affective empathy among the offenders. Our findings suggest that not only different   experienced in hood and adolescence had different predictive effects on empathy among offenders but  the degrees of   and whether the paternal and maternal   were consistent or inconsistent may affect the patterns of   and empathy. Moreover, the al control factor had a particular influence on empathy among the offenders. Our findings underscore the pressing need for adopting preventive monitoring measures or developing policies to improve  ."

The s' sample included 71 fathers and 52 mothers, and the adolescents' sample included 78 boys and 45 girls, whose ages ranged from 14 to 18 with a mean age of 16.00 +/- 1.40. Most  reporting on their s'   perceived them as authoritative (about 45%). The s' group's   varied by their education, as authoritative s were significantly more educated than non-authoritative s. The findings indicate that adolescents who perceived their s'   as authoritative reported significantly higher self-esteem in comparison to their counterparts who perceived their s'   either as authoritarian or permissive. Furthermore, the s' reports of their   accounted for about 30% of the variance in the adolescents' self-esteem, with the authoritative  being the only  associated with high self-esteem and its association with this variable was considerably stronger than those of the non-authoritative  . Our findings, drawn from separate reports of s and their descendants, underscore the merits of authoritative  in the context of Bedouin adolescents' self-esteem. Together with other recent evidence, they consolidate the assumption that this  is the cross-culturally preferred  within diverse developmental contexts of 's well-being."

Does your  think you're happy? Exploring the associations between 's happiness and parenting styles,2020,"The   aimed to explore 's perception of their happiness, as well as their s', and to investigate their potential associations with  . The sample included 73  (age range 5 to 8 years old, M = 6.57, SD = 1.06) and one of their s (age range 29-47 years old, M = 36.45, SD = 4.08, 85% mothers). s filled in a   and dimensions questionnaire. We used The Faces Scale to assess 's attributions of happiness, while a focused interview obtained spontaneous verbal descriptions of what made both  and their s happy. We used both qualitative and quantitative methods to explore our data. Most  considered their compliance with family rules as s' main source of happiness. Family relationships and friendship were found to be the primary sources for 's happiness. Correlation analyses suggested significant associations between 's self-reported happiness, s' perceived happiness, and some of the permissive (lack of follow-through) and authoritarian (directiveness)  ' dimensions. These findings may be useful for both the development and implementation of positive socioemotional programs during hood, as well as for the general - internal dynamic."
Parenting Styles and Psychiatric Profile of Parents of Adult Substance Use Disorder Patients: Cross-sectional Study,,"The purpose of this Lebanese, cross-sectional, multi-centric  is to examine the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among adult patients with substance use disorder and their s along with the predominant  . A total of 100 patients suffering from a substance use disorder, and their s (N = 127) were administered the translated Arabic version of the MINI to diagnose lifetime psychiatric disorders. The al Authority Questionnaire (PAQ) in its translated validated Arabic version was filled by patients to detect the predominant  . The least common   reported was authoritative (25%). The s' prevalence of nicotine dependence, alcohol abuse and dependence, and illicit substance abuse and dependence were considerably higher than the general population. Mood and anxiety disorders were more prevalent among patients and their s compared to the Lebanese general population. In the bivariate analysis, no significant association was found between the perceived   (authoritative and non-authoritative) and s' economic (p = 0.545) and civil status (p = 0.231), patient's gender (p = 0.390), birth order (p = 0.084), and s' and offspring psychiatric disorder. Hence, an underlying genetic and environmental mechanism could potentially explain our findings rather than a rearing problem; however, further studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm this hypothesis."
"The Relationship between Parenting Styles and Adolescents' Social Anxiety in Migrant Families: A Study in Guangdong, China",2017,"Previous studies indicated that   were important influencing factors for the development of 's well-being. It is known that mass migration to the cities in China will affect family relations. However, few studies focused on the relationship between   and adolescents' mental health in migrant families. Thus, this  aimed to investigate how   could affect adolescent's social anxiety in migrant families. A total number of 1,345 adolescents in migrant families from four non-government-funded junior middle schools in Guangdong province formed the  sample.   were measured using short-form of the Egna Minnen Betraffande Uppfostran, and social anxiety was evaluated using Social Anxiety Subscale of Self-Consciousness Scale. The  showed that emotional warmth, overprotection and rejection were significantly more often perceived from mothers than from fathers. Significant group differences between high social anxiety group and low social anxiety group were found in both father's rearing  and mother's rearing . Furthermore, in migrant families, paternal emotional warmth could decrease adolescents' social anxiety, whereas maternal overprotection could increase it."
Differentiation of Perceived Parenting Style of Adolescence Depending on the Internet Addiction Levels,2019,"Inappropriate  rearing  are closely related to adolescence's Internet addiction.

This is in accordance to findings of that low social support predicts the pathological Internet use."
Juvenile offenders who assault their parents: A study of personality traits and parenting styles,2012,"The aim of this investigation is to determine if there are different personality traits and   between adolescents that assault their s and those that do not. For this purpose, the Millon Adolescent Clinical Inventory (MACI) and Musitu & Garcia's Scale of al Socialisation Styles in Adolescence (ESPA29) were administered to a sample of 14 adolescents of both sexes (9 males and 5 females), age ranged between 14 and 18 years, placed in semi-open juvenile detention centres in Andalucia. To determine the differential characteristics, the same tests were administered to a paired sample of students from a secondary education school in Seville who did not show violent behaviour toward their s. The  confirm that aggressive young people possess traits of antisocial personality and depressive symptoms and their s' socialisation  is characterised by low coercion/imposition."
Examining the Interaction of Parental Involvement and Parenting Style in Predicting Adherence in Youth With Type 1 Diabetes,2016,"Introduction: This  examined whether aspects of   (specifically, warmth, autonomy support, and coercion) moderated the association between al involvement and adherence in youth with type 1 diabetes. Methods: Children ages 8 to 16 years with type 1 diabetes and a  completed assessments of al involvement,  , and adherence. Results:  autonomy support and coercion were associated with adherence but warmth was not. Child report of more al involvement was associated with better adherence. Warmth, autonomy support, and coercion were not moderators. Discussion: The findings underscore the importance of al involvement, operationalized as responsibility for diabetes tasks, and  , specifically coercion and autonomy support, for adherence in pediatric chronic illness management. Longitudinal  is needed to better understand how and why dimensions of involvement (e.g., responsibility, monitoring, support) vary over time and whether they impact outcomes differentially."
ADHD Symptoms and Academic Adjustment to College: The Role of Parenting Style,2015,"Objective: The primary aim of this  was to examine relationships among  , symptoms of ADHD, and academic adjustment in college students. Specifically, we investigated whether   may act as a buffer in the negative relationship between ADHD symptoms and academic adjustment. Method: Participants were 200 undergraduate students attending a large public university. Questionnaires measuring their ADHD symptoms, 's  , and academic adjustment were completed. Results: Results indicated small but significant moderation effects for authoritarian  and authoritative  on the relationship between ADHD symptoms and academic adjustment. Conclusion: Although  has revealed that different   may relate to different outcomes in  with ADHD, for young adults, the effects of  on academic adjustment may be diluted. Future  should investigate variables that may be more salient predictors of functional outcomes for this population, such as organizational skills."
"Can Money Buy Happiness for a Family? Family Income, Parenting Style, and Life Satisfaction in Parents and Adolescents",2021,"This  investigated the associations among family income and life satisfaction in s, and  , income, and overall happiness and depression in their adolescents. A total of 1,913 participants comprising adolescents (aged 14-16) and their s were recruited for this . Participants were assessed using self-report questionnaires. Monthly household income was recorded by an open-ended question item. The life satisfaction of s and overall happiness of adolescents were assessed by one item each, rated on a 4-point Likert scale. Three subtypes of   (affectionate, monitoring, over-control) were evaluated by adolescents using an inventory consisting of 21 items on a 4-point Likert scale. Adolescents' depression was assessed with a checklist rated by the adolescents, consisting of 10 items on a 4-point Likert scale. The odds ratio (OR) for life dissatisfaction in adults was significantly higher in the lower (1st and 2nd) quintile groups of household income, by 9.94 (p < .001) and 3.50 (p < .001) folds, respectively, compared to the highest (5th) group. In contrast, household income had no significant association with life unhappiness in adolescents. Further, total household income had no significant association with the adolescent's depression score in linear regression analysis, but   did. While affectionate (beta = -0.260; p < .001) and monitoring (beta = -0.100; p < .001)   showed negative associations with adolescents' depression scores, over-control  (beta = 0.120; p < .001) showed a positive association.

Factors influencing young 's risk of unintentional injury: Parenting style and strategies for teaching about home safety,2006,"This  examined mothers' teaching about home-safety issues to 24-30 month and 36-42 month old , explored the relationship of teaching strategies to  , and assessed how these factors are related to 's risk of unintentional injury. A structured interview assessed home-safety issues relevant to falls, bums, cuts, poisoning, and suffocation/strangulation/choking. Mothers identified safety issues relevant to her , and indicated the type and extent to which she utilized teaching as a strategy to address each safety issue. Standardized questionnaires provided information about   and 's history of injuries. Results revealed that mothers' endorsements of home-safety issues did not vary with  age, mothers used teaching to manage safety issues for all types of injuries, and type of teaching strategy (explanations, rules, behavior modification) varied with  . Greater use of explaining and less rule usage was linked to permissive ; these teaching strategies predicted 's medically-attended injury among highly-permissive mothers. Thus, teaching about safety is a common risk-management strategy mothers use to address hazards in the home. However, the specific type of teaching strategy used varies with  , which has implications for 's risk of injury. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Parenting styles and 's internalizing-externalizing behavior: The mediating role of behavioral regulation,2020,"The goal was to examine the contribution of   to externalizing/internalizing problems in  and early-adolescents, on the hypothesis that   would affect externalizing and internalizing problems via its effects on behavioral dysregulation. The participants were s and teachers of 199  (111 F) from 6 to 15 years old. A multi-informant  was carried out to assess   (s reports), and (a) behavioral dysregulation, (b) aggressive behavior with peers, (c) hyperactivity/distractibility, (d) anxiety/fear, in an ecological interactive context such as the classroom (teacher report). We tested our hypotheses with Structural Equation Model analysis. Authoritarian  is associated with aggressive behavior with peers, hyperactivity/distractibility, and anxiety/fear, via its effects on behavioral dysregulation. These findings confirm that the authoritarian  plays an important role in externalizing and internalizing problems by increasing behavioral dysregulation, and it has broad implications for interventions aimed at reducing maladjustment in  and adolescents."
Parenting Styles and College Enrollment: A Path Analysis of Risky Human Capital Decisions,2017,"In this , we examined how s influence the higher education decision-making process of young adults. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997,  from a path analysis showed that, although   were not directly linked with college enrollment, they were indirectly associated with college enrollment via their prior associations with a number of variables, including young adults' subjective probability of completing college, time preferences, academic achievement, cognitive ability, and al expectations. These findings suggest that although s may be less directly involved with higher education choices of young adults, they still have an important indirect influence on these choices.   impacts the 's beliefs, expectations, and attitudes, all of which ultimately play a role in the decision of whether or not to enroll in college."
"Parenting style and locus of control, motivation, and school adaptation among students with borderline intellectual functioning",2014,"Background:   impacts s psychosocial development. Students with borderline intellectual functioning (BIF) are especially sensitive to the quality of al care. The objective of this  was to compare   of mothers of  with BIF and mothers of typically developing peers, and establish associations between   and s psychosocial traits, which determine their school functioning. Participants and procedure: Forty-two primary school students in Grades 4 to 6, their teachers, and mothers participated in the . Based on their IQ level they comprised two groups: students with BIF (criterion group; n = 21) and students with average IQ (comparison group; n = 21). A series of measures were used to assess mothers   and students psychosocial traits. Questionnaires measuring students psychosocial properties were administered to  and their teachers in order to compare their perspectives. Results: Mothers of  with BIF in comparison to mothers in the control group ed greater inclinations towards over-. Based on self-reports, students with BIF did not differ from their typically developing classmates in terms of school motivation, anxiety, locus of control, or social adjustment, despite their lower academic performance. According to teachers, students with BIF had significantly lower school motivation and delayed socialization. For students with BIF but not for the comparison group, a negative correlation was found between mothers tendency to dominate over their  and students locus of control and school motivation. Conclusions: Children with BIF are especially sensitive to the quality of mothers  , which can have an adverse effect on their school adjustment"
"The relationship between procrastination, perceived stress, saliva alpha-amylase level and parenting styles in Chinese first year medical students",2019,"Background: Procrastination is prevalent among students today, and this negatively impacts upon their academic achievement. The current  aimed to explore the relationship between procrastination, perceived stress, saliva alpha-amylase (sAA) levels, and the   of Chinese first year medical students (MBBS). Methods: We recruited 140 MBBS students aged 18-22 years. Assessments included the Procrastination Assessment Scale-Students (PASS), the Chinese version of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), saliva alpha-amylase level (sAA), and the Chinese version of the Egna Minnen av Barndoms Uppfostran (EMBU) which assesses  . PSS and sAA levels were assessed at week 1 (baseline), then again at week 2 and week 4. Results: Male students reported higher levels of procrastination and perceived stress reactions than their female counterparts. Male students reported experiencing higher punishing/severe and rejecting (ie negative)  , while female students reported experiencing higher warm and affectionate (ie positive)  . Positive   were negatively associated with to procrastination and stress reactions, while negative   were positively associated with procrastination and delayed stress reactions among MBBS students. Conclusion: Procrastination induced stress in MBBS students, providing further evidence that procrastination enhances stress in young adulthood. Negative  , such as being punishing and rejecting, had a positive correlation with procrastination."
Perceived Parenting Style of Fathers and Adolescents' Locus of Control in a Collectivist Culture of Malaysia: The Moderating Role of Fathers' Education,2013,"The authors investigated the moderating role of father's education on the associations between perceived paternal   and locus of control among 382 Malaysian adolescents with an average age of 14.27. Data were collected by means of adolescents' self-report using standardized instruments (i.e., al authority questionnaire and Nowicki-Strickland Internal-External Control Scale for Children). Results revealed that there were significant negative relationships between fathers' authoritative   (r = .243, p < .001) and authoritarian   (r = .130, p < .01) with adolescents' internal locus of control. Furthermore, the findings indicated that father's high level of education moderated the relationship between perceived paternal authoritarian  and locus of control (b = 0.147, p < .001). The findings underscore the need to include the role of s' education when assessing the links between   and adolescents' locus of control."

Differences in the levels of   (authoritative and authoritarian ) and self-regulation abilities between Asian Americans (AAs) and European Americans (EAs) have been found. However, few studies have explored the associations between   and self-regulation among emerging adults across these two cultural groups. The   compared 377 emerging adults (146 AAs and 231 EAs, 71% female, M-age = 20.19, SDage = 1.67) on the following: a) their perceptions of their s'  , (b) their self-regulation ability, and (c) the associations between perceived   and self-regulation skills. Our moderated mediation analysis indicated that   explained the ethnic differences in emerging adults' self-regulation, but ethnicity did not moderate the effects of   on self-regulation. Specifically, compared with their EA counterparts, AA emerging adults perceived receiving lower levels of authoritative  and higher levels of authoritarian , which in turn predicted lower self-regulation abilities in AA versus EA emerging adults. However, for both AA and EA emerging adults, authoritative  was positively associated with self-regulation and authoritarian  was negatively associated with self-regulation."
Changing parenting style between two generations and its impacts on the severity of behavioral and emotional symptoms,2022,"Objective The purpose of this  is to compare the perceived  dimensions in mothers and their daughters (differences between two generations), and  the relationship between these dimensions and the severity of daughters' behavioral and emotional symptoms. Materials and Methods 300 participants (150 daughters with their mothers) participated in this . They responded to the perceived   questionnaire (PSQ), and mothers were additionally asked to answer the  symptoms inventory-4 (CSI-4). Data analysis was done by the SPSS using the paired sample t-test and multiple regressions. Results The  indicated a significant difference between perceived  dimensions in mothers and their daughters; specifically, acceptance and control dimensions increased through generation. It was  found that daughters' acceptance-rejection dimension could predict the severity of the symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders, autism spectrum disorders, depression, dysthymia, conduct disorders, and opposite defiant disorders. The control-autonomy dimension could  predict the severity of schizophrenia symptoms.

Implicit and Explicit Self-Esteem as a Function of Perceived Parenting Styles Among Children With ADHD,2018,"Objective: To investigate implicit and explicit self-esteem and academic self-evaluation among  with ADHD as a function of  , namely, authoritarian, authoritative and permissive . Method: Participants included 43  with ADHD and 35 non-ADHD controls who filled out self-concept and perceived   questionnaires. They  took an Implicit Association Test (IAT) that measured unacknowledged self-esteem. Results: Lower self-esteem was found among  with ADHD than among controls, with stronger effect on the implicit level. Perceived authoritarian  was related to lower implicit self-esteem among  with ADHD. Higher self-esteem was found in the authoritative than in the permissive  groups in the non-ADHD control group but not among  with ADHD. Conclusion: The role of al support versus authoritarian  in terms of implicit self-esteem points to the importance of promoting responsiveness strategies among s in the treatment of  with ADHD."
Association Between Parenting Style and Social Outcomes in Children with and Without Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: An 18-Month Longitudinal Study,2017,"Objective: In a community-based sample of  with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (n = 179) and non-ADHD controls (n = 212), this longitudinal  explored changes in   over time; and whether   prospectively predicts  functional outcomes. Methods: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder diagnosis was assessed using the Conners ADHD index and Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children IV. Children (70.3% boys) were assessed at baseline (mean age: 7.3 yr) and after 18 months (mean age: 8.9 yr) using a range of -and teacher-reported measures of  socioemotional and academic functioning.   was assessed through -reported measures of warmth, consistency, and anger. Results: At 18-month follow-up, there was a small significant decline in  warmth and  anger, and an increase in  consistency across groups. In the ADHD group,  warmth at baseline was positively related to 18-month prosocial behavior and responsibility by  report, whereas  consistency predicted these  outcomes by teacher report.  anger was positively associated with peer problems and negatively associated with prosocial behavior, self-control, and responsibility by  report. Associations were similar for non-ADHD controls and all associations held after adjusting for a range of family, , and  factors. After additional adjustment of baseline levels of  functioning,  warmth and consistency continued to be associated with 18-month  outcomes.   was unrelated to emotional problems and academic competence over time. Conclusion:   is independently related to aspects of future social outcomes of  with ADHD. Results hold implications for  interventions aimed at managing ADHD-related social impairments over time."

Family correlates of 's social and physical aggression with peers: Negative interparental conflict strategies and parenting styles,2008,"This investigation examines whether negative interal conflict strategies (stonewalling, triangulation, verbal aggression, and physical aggression) and   are related to social and physical aggression with peers for  followed longitudinally from age 9 to 10 (N = 256). s reported on negative conflict strategies and   at the beginning of the  and teachers rated 's social and physical aggression with peers when  were in the 3rd and 4th grades. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that, for girls, mothers' negative interal conflict strategies were positively associated with both social and physical aggression with peers. Mothers' negative conflict strategies were not related to boys' social and physical aggression at school, fathers' negative conflict strategies were not related to aggression for either gender, and no relations emerged for  . These  offer partial support for a same-gender modeling hypothesis and suggest that girls' social and physical aggression at school may be related to watching mothers resolve marital disputes by engaging in triangulation, stonewalling, and verbal and physical aggression with partners."
Associations between parenting styles and excessive screen usage in preschool ,2021,"Objective: Young  and preschoolers are now growing up in settings filled with a variety of technological devices. Despite the recommendation that s should limit screen time, many preschoolers are exposed to screens at very early ages and for a long time. This  aimed to investigate the associations between   and the excessive screen time of preschool-aged . Material and Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive  included preschool  with low screen exposure (<1 hour; n=176) and excessive screen exposure (>4 hours; n=74). A self-completion-structured survey form and  Attitude Scale were filled by the mothers. Results: More than half (52.0%) of them were male . Increased number of , Increased household sizes, mothers being unemployed, birth order 2:2, and home-based care were found to be statistically significantly higher in the excessive screen exposure group than in the low screen exposure group. Mothers and fathers in the excessive screen exposure group had lower educational levels compared with their counterparts in the low screen exposure group (p<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that mothers' high authoritative (democratic) scores were associated with low screen exposure(adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 0.3; 95% confidence interval (CD: 0.1-0.9). High overprotective and permissive  subscale scores were related to excessive screen exposure after adjusting potential confounders (AOR: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.1-6.7; AOR: 4.5, 95% CI: 1.8-11.6). Conclusion: Excessive screening time may indicate a problematic - relationship. Establishing a positive - relationship can be an effective way of managing screen time in preschool ."
Depression and social anxiety mediate the relationship between parenting styles and risk of eating disorders: A study among Arab adolescents,2021,"In multicultural Israel, the prevalence of eating disorders (EDs), a common chronic disorder among Western adolescents (especially females), has risen for Arab adolescents, who belong to an Eastern collectivist society. The  examines family and psychological factors that may increase the risk of EDs among Muslim Arab adolescents. We expected social anxiety and depressive symptoms to mediate the association between   and risk of EDs, with possible gender differences in the mediation model. Participants were 613 Muslim adolescents (394 females and 219 males); mean age = 15.4 +/- 1.6; range = 12-19. The analyses revealed that the severity of depressive symptoms and especially social anxiety mediate the relationship between authoritarian   and risk of EDs. Females reported higher levels of risk of EDs, social anxiety, depression and authoritative   than males; no differences appeared for authoritarian or permissive  . The  sheds new light on risk factors for EDs and the likelihood of authoritarian   and social anxiety being involved in the aetiology of EDs among Arab adolescents.

Using the Born in Bradford (BiB) birth cohort, which is located in an ethnically diverse and economically deprived UK city, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of mother's self-reported  confidence, self-efficacy, hostility and warmth, and infant temperament at six months of age. We examined responses from women of Pakistani (N = 554) and White British (N = 439) origin. Pakistani mothers reported feeling more confident about their abilities as a . Significantly fewer Pakistani women adopted a hostile approach to , an effect that was attenuated after adjustment for socioeconomic status and mental health. Overall, women with more self-efficacious, warm and less hostile   reported significantly fewer problems with their infant's temperaments. Of women with higher self-efficacy  , Pakistani mothers were significantly more likely than White British mothers to report more problematic infant temperaments, although absolute differences were small. It is unlikely that the ethnic variation seen in 's cognitive and behavioural outcomes in hood is attributable to differences in  or infant characteristics reported at six months."
Where authoritarianism is not always bad: Parenting styles and romantic relationship quality among emerging adults in Singapore,,"The associations between perceived maternal   and emerging adults' romantic relationship quality (commitment and compromise) were examined in the Singaporean context. Participants were 155 ethnic Chinese Singaporeans aged 18 to 25, who were in current romantic relationships that had lasted for at least one month prior to the . Participants completed the locally-validated al Authority Questionnaire (PAQ) that measured perceived authoritative and authoritarian  by mothers, along with the commitment subscale of the Relationship Experiences Questionnaire and the compromise subscale of the Conflict Resolution Behavior Questionnaire. Latent Profile Analysis showed that 107 individuals had authoritative mothers, while 48 had authoritarian mothers. Emerging adults with authoritative mothers tended to compromise more than those with authoritarian mothers, whereas those with authoritarian mothers reported greater commitment. Authoritativeness was related to greater compromise in romantic relationships, but less commitment towards a romantic partner. Authoritarianism was neither related to commitment nor compromise. The findings showed that   continued to play a role in romantic relationship quality in emerging adulthood. Furthermore, Baumrind's  typology, particularly authoritative and authoritarian , may have a different functional meaning in the Singaporean context."

Role of Parental Attachment Styles in Moderating Interaction Between Parenting Stress and Perceived Infant Characteristics,2021,"By employing the transactional model of development and focusing on the multifactorial nature of , this  aimed to (1) examine whether important risk factors, particularly mothers' insecure attachment  and  stress contribute to the perception of their infants' characteristics and (2) explore whether maternal attachment  moderate the relationship between  stress and perceived infants' characteristics. We recruited 357 mothers (age: 34.23; +/- 5.38) who had 1-year-old infants (161 males and 196 females; age: 12.70; +/- 1.60 months). All the mothers completed three self-report instruments:  Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF), Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ), and 1st-Year Inventory (FYI). Although the latter was originally developed to determine the risk for autism in 1-year-olds, it was employed in this  to measure infant's characteristics within two domains: social communication and sensory regulatory functions. Multiple regression analyses revealed that one of the PSI-SF dimensions - specifically the -Child Dysfunctional Interaction - contributed to mothers' perceptions of their 's social communication abilities, whereas the attachment  did not. Other multiple regression analyses showed that all the dimensions of  stress - that is,  Distress (PD), -Child Dysfunctional Interaction (PCDI), and Difficult Child (DC) - contributed to mothers' perceptions of their sensory regulatory abilities. The attachment , particularly anxious attachment, contributed significantly to a biased perception of these abilities controlled for  stress. Mothers reporting high levels of avoidance and high levels of PD viewed their  as less able in the social communicative domain (SC Dom) than if they had low levels of PD. By contrast, when levels of avoidance were low, mothers with high PD perceived their  as less difficult in the SC Dom than those with low levels of PD. Moreover, high avoidance levels influenced how mothers who considered the interaction with their  as difficult perceived them as having greater difficulties in relation to sensory regulatory domain (SR Dom). By contrast, mothers with high levels of anxiety high levels of PD view their  as less able in the SC Dom than if they had low levels of PD. When mothers' levels of anxiety were very low, those with high PD viewed their  as less difficult in the SC Dom in comparison to those with low levels of PD."
Parental feeding style changes the relationships between 's food preferences and food parenting practices: The case for comprehensive food parenting interventions by pediatric healthcare professionals,2019,"Purpose To determine if al feeding  (emotional environment of the meal) moderate the relationship between food  practices (goal-directed behaviors) and 's preferences for fruits, vegetables, or high fat/sugar foods. Design and Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive  recruited s (n = 108) of preschool age . The s completed several questionnaires. Linear regressions were used to assess the relationship between food  practices and 's food preferences as moderated by feeding , with the authoritative feeding  serving as the reference. Results al feeding  were found to be moderators between several food  practices and  food preferences. When compared with s with the authoritative feeding  (high demands, responds to 's needs),  like vegetables significantly less if indulgent (low demands, responds to 's needs) s allow  to control their own eating, or authoritarian (high demands, does not respond to 's needs), or uninvolved (low demands, does not respond to 's needs) s provide a healthy food environment. The authoritative  was not always preferential. For example,  of uninvolved s who used food as a reward liked vegetables significantly more than  of s who had the authoritative feeding  who  used food as a reward. In addition,  of authoritarian s who modeled healthy eating liked foods high in fat and/or sugar significantly less than  of authoritative s. Practice Implications: When discussing  diet quality with s, pediatric nurses should educate s on both food  practices and feeding , or the meal's emotional climate, as  experience both of these during mealtime interactions. In addition, for educational efforts, it may be advantageous to tailor interventions based upon the 's feeding ."
Self-reported parenting style - German extended version of the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire for Elementary School Age Children (GEAPQ-ES),2009,"A 40-item German version of the Alabama  Questionnaire (APQ; Frick, 1991) for s of elementary school  was created by translating, adapting, and extending the original questionnaire to measure the dimensions of Positive  Behaviour, Involvement, (Poor) Monitoring, Inconsistent Discipline, and Corporal Punishment. Two additional scales were constructed to assess Authoritarian  and Responsible . The instrument was administered twice within six months to N = 373 (319) s of elementary school . Factor analyses confirmed the seven dimensions; the psychometrical properties were good to satisfactory, with stabilities from r = .57 to 4 = .77. The validation with a German short version of the Child Behaviour Checklist for non-clinical samples revealed the expected cross sectional relationships between Inconsistency, Poor Monitoring, Corporal Punishment, and Authoritarian  with Hyperactivity, Oppositional-Defiant Behaviour, and Social-Emotional Problems at both measurement points. Positive , Responsible  and Involvement were related to 's Social Competence. Consistent with a model of spill-over, s' Overall Relationship Happiness was positively related to Positive and to Responsible , and negatively to Inconsistent . Social Desirability was significantly related positively to the extremely positive forms of  and negatively to the extremely negative forms of  (Inconsistent  Behaviour in mothers and fathers, Corporal Punishment and Positive  Behaviour in mothers)."
Relationships between parenting styles and psychopathic traits in hood,2012,"During the last decade, a growing interest has been generated in the analysis and understanding of etiological mechanisms related to the development of psychopathic traits in hood. Although contextual factors have been poorly studied, some approaches suggest that certain environmental factors, namely  practices, may play an important role in the development and expressions of psychopathic personality. In this line, this  aims to analyze, firstly, the relationship between psychopathic traits and  practices and, secondly, to what extent the different  of al socialization are related to psychopathic personality in hood. To achieve this objective, data were collected from s (173) and teachers (113) about 192  (aged 6-11 years). The  show the existence of statistically significant relationships between  practices/, and the presence of psychopathic traits, both affective-interpersonal and behavioral, at early ages."
The role of parenting styles and socio-economic status in parents' knowledge of  development,2016,"Early hood development (ECD) has been recognised to be the most important contributor to long-term social and emotional development. Therefore, positive  is paramount to foster quality - interaction. Previous  shows that for s to adopt a positive  , some degree of al knowledge is required. The aim of this  was to compare the relationship between knowledge of  development and   in low and high socio-economic groups of s in ECD centres. A cross-sectional  was conducted using a correlation-comparative  design. The sample consisted of N=140 s with  between two and five years old from low and high socio-economic groups. Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation were used to analyse the data. The findings  show that there is no correlation between knowledge of  development and authoritative  . However, correlations do exist between the other variables."
Parenting styles and psychological needs influences on adolescent life goals and aspirations in a South African setting,2015,"The   examined the role of   and basic psychological needs in the adoption of goals and aspirations of learners, as well as for their psychological wellbeing (positive versus negative affect) in a South African sample of learners. A cross-sectional design was used to conduct this  with a sample of 853 learners at public schools in the Western Cape of South Africa (females = 57%, mean age 16.96 years, SD = 1.12). Data were collected using the  Style and Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ), Psychological Needs Scale, Aspiration Index and the Positive And Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). The  suggest that authoritative and authoritarian   influence the adoption of life goals and psychological wellbeing of adolescents with fathers' negative  possibly reducing adolescent wellbeing. Extrinsic life goals was a significant predictor of positive affect, while need frustration was a significant predictor of negative affect. These findings suggest   and basic psychological needs influence life aspirations and psychological wellbeing of learners in a developing country context."

The Mediating Role of Social Support in the Relationship Between Parenting Styles and Adolescent Drug Abuse Identification,2022,"Adolescent drug abuse is a social issue of global concern, causing a serious burden of diseases for individuals, families and society. To design effective prevention and intervention strategies for adolescent drug abusers, the predictive factors associated with drug abuse must be quantified and assessed. This  explores the similarities and differences between the   of adolescent drug abusers and non-drug abusers and applies a structural equation model to analyze the mechanisms involved between  , social support and adolescent drug abuse identification. Data were derived from adolescent drug abusers (n = 363) and non-drug abusers (n = 229) between the ages of 18 and 35 in China, and the data were collected and analyzed by SPSS 26 and AMOS 24. The  show that   significantly predict adolescent drug abuse identification, and different   have different influencing mechanisms, which further indicates that poor   are a risk factor for adolescent drug abuse. Additionally, social support plays a mediating role between   and drug abuse identification (chi(2)/df = 4.52, CFI = 0.939, TLI = 0.914, RMSEA = 0.077, IFI = 0.939, PCFI = 0.671). The specific pathways involved are as follows: Paternal   -> Social support -> Drug abuse identification and Maternal   -> Social support -> Drug abuse identification. However, beyond this, the mediation model of social support shows good adaptability and stability between adolescent drug abusers and non-drug abusers. Since   and social support are important predictors of adolescent drug abuse, the importance of integrating family-social support antidrug programs into adolescent prevention and intervention strategies should be considered."
Parenting Styles and Health-Related Behavior in Childhood and Early Adolescence Results of a Longitudinal Study,2009,"This  addresses the development of health-related behavior during hood and adolescence and the protective influence of an authoritative  .

The first sample consisted of 432 second graders with a mean age of 7.9 years at the beginning of the , while the second sample consisted of 366 fourth graders with a mean age of 10.1 years. Later health behavior showed substantial correlations to previous health behavior over a 3-year interval. Moreover, there was an increase of favorable health behavior during elementary school and a decrease in the subsequent age periods. The slope for negative health behavior showed an inverted pattern. The level of this general trend was significantly affected by the perceived maternal and paternal   and by gender. The significance of the  for health promotion is discussed."
Validity and reliability of the Tibetan version of s-EMBU for measuring parenting styles,2017,"  experienced during hood has profound effects on 's futures. Scales developed in other countries have never been validated in the Tibetan context. The   aimed to examine the construct validity and reliability of a Tibetan translation of the 23-item short form of the Egna Minnen Betraffande Uppfostran [One's Memories of Upbringing] (s-EMBU) and to test the correlation between the   of fathers and mothers. A cross-sectional  was conducted in a sample of 847 students aged 12-21 years from Lhasa, Tibet, during September and October 2015 with a participation rate of 97.7%. The Tibetan translation of self-completed s-EMBU was administered. Confirmatory factor analysis was employed to test the scale's validity on the first half of the sample and was then cross-validated with the second half of the sample. The final model consisted of six factors: three (rejection, emotional warmth, and overprotection) for each , equality constrained on factor loadings, factor correlations, and error variance between father and mother. Father-mother correlation coefficients ranged from 0.81 to 0.86, and the level of consistency ranged from 0.62 to 0.82. Thus, the slightly modified s-EMBU is suitable for use in the Tibetan culture where both the father and the mother have consistent  ."

The impact of 's socioemotional development on parenting styles: the moderating effect of social withdrawal,,"This  focused on associations between 's socioemotional development (prosocial behaviour, internalizing and externalizing problems) and   (affection, behavioural control, and psychological control), and the moderating role of 's social withdrawal (as a temperamental characteristic) in these associations. Children's socioemotional development (n= 314) were rated by teachers at three-time points (grades 1-3). s completed questionnaires measuring their   at the same three-time points. The level of social withdrawal was obtained at the end of kindergarten from teachers' reports. Panel analysis showed that prosocial behaviour was associated with a higher level of affection, while externalizing problems were associated with a higher level of behavioural control. Among  with a high level of social withdrawal, prosocial behaviour predicted high maternal psychological control, while internalizing problems predicted high paternal psychological control. However, among  with a low level of social withdrawal, socioemotional development had no impact on  ."
PARENTING STYLE AND DEVELOPMENTAL STATUS AMONG CHILDREN WITH NONORGANIC FAILURE-TO-THRIVE,1994,"Examined differences in several developmental indices of competence among 102 low-income, inner-city, predominantly African American  with non-organic failure to thrive (NOFTT) and a comparison group of 67  with adequate growth matched on age, gender, race, and socioeconomic status. s were categorized into one of three groups (nurturant, authoritarian, and neglecting) based on observations during feeding. s of  with NOFTT were less nurturant and more neglecting than s of comparison . Associations between   and 's social-cognitive development were similar across groups. Children of nurturant s consistently demonstrated better social-cognitive development. Results support the importance of considering heterogeneity among high-risk families and the need to examine the relationships linking   and  development."
Relationship among parenting style and depression and anxiety in  aged 3 - 13 years old,2019,"Despite its low visibility, internalizing problems are increasingly  in , and they are often associated to inadequate  patterns. This paper analyses a possible existing relationship between depression and anxiety in , reported by s through the BASC (Behaviour Assessment System for Children), and the   according to the PCRI (-Child Relationship Inventory), along with different family variables. In this  554  (288 male and 266 female) aged 3-13 years old participated. The  show that  with higher depression scores were more likely to have s with a low level of support, satisfaction with , involvement, communication, autonomy and limit setting of both s, along with a low role orientation by their mothers. Children with high anxiety scores were more likely to have s who have low level of support, limit setting and autonomy, along with a low level of satisfaction with  and role orientation in the mother. Furthermore, the regression analysis sheds models capable of predicting 31% of the variance of depression and 16% of the variance for the anxiety model. Finally, we discuss the utility of the  for the design of guide programmes based upon concrete aspects of the daily educational practice."

There were 436 relationally victimized adolescents (M age = 13.26 years, SD = .56) included in this , along with their s (n = 436; M age = 47.01 years, SD = .83; 86% mothers), from the Midwestern region of the United States (N = 872). Adolescents completed questionnaires on their experiences of relational victimization, depression, and anxiety, and perceptions of their s'  . Their s completed a questionnaire on their relational victimization status during adolescence. Findings from the  revealed that the relationships between the permissive  , depression, and anxiety among relationally victimized adolescents were stronger when adolescents' s were  victims of relational bullying during adolescence. These findings underscore the importance of considering s' peer victimization history during adolescence."
"A social learning perspective: A model of parenting styles, self-regulation, perceived drinking control, and alcohol use and problems",2001,"Background: This investigation sought to determine how different   are related to general self-regulatory processes that are linked to alcohol use and abuse. Self-regulation and, more specifically, thoughts of control over drinking are forms of positive self-control mechanisms.   are known determinants of both negative and positive self-control mechanisms in offspring. According to social learning theory, stronger relationships between   and self-regulatory processes would be expected from the  who is the same sex as the respondent. Methods: A total of 144 female and 107 male college students currently using alcohol were administered a questionnaire on their alcohol use and problems, perceived  of  (authoritarian, permissive, or authoritative) of their s, self-regulation, and perceived control of drinking. A model linking  , self-regulatory processes, and control over drinking with alcohol use and alcohol problems was tested across sex groups by using structural equation modeling. Results: In general, the   of the  of the same sex as the respondent's was found to be significantly related to self-regulation, which is known to be protective against alcohol use and abuse. A permissive  of the same sex as the respondent was negatively associated with good self-regulatory processes for both men and women. Having an authoritative mother was  shown to be related to higher levels of self-regulation for women. Conclusions: Self-regulation mediated the pathway from a permissive   to perceived drinking control, which, in turn, mediated the pathway from self-regulation to alcohol use and problems. Finally, self-regulation mediated the positive pathway from an authoritative mother to perceived control over drinking for women."
Problem partners and parenting: exploring linkages with maternal insecure attachment style and adolescent offspring internalizing disorder,2009,"An intergenerational  examined mothers' insecure attachment  using the Attachment Style Interview (ASI; Bifulco et al., 2002a) in relation to her history of partner relationships, her  competence, and depression or anxiety disorder in her offspring. The sample comprised 146 high-risk, mother-adolescent offspring pairs in London, who were recruited on the basis of the mothers' psychosocial vulnerability for depression. Retrospective, biographical, and clinical interviews were undertaken independently with mother and offspring. A path model was developed, which showed that mothers' insecure attachment  had no direct link to either recalled  neglect/abuse or currently assessed disorder in their adolescent and young adult offspring. The connections appeared to be indirect, through the quality of relationships in the family system: mothers' insecure attachment and their partners' problem behavior accounted for variance in mothers' incompetent  as rated by interviewers. These variables predicted her neglect/abuse of the , which was the only variable directly associated with internalizing disorder in her offspring. Mother's lifetime depression did not add to the model. It is argued that an ecological approach (emphasizing social adversity and different role domains) and a lifespan approach (emphasizing a history of adverse relationships a different life stages) is important in understanding the mechanisms by which al insecure attachment  influences transmission of risk to the next generation."
PARENTING STYLES AND OFFSPRING'S POLYSUBSTANCE USE IN BIOLOGICAL AND ADOPTIVE FAMILIES,2014,"From the perspective of socialization theory, one aspect of the family environment that has been hypothesized to be one of the strongest predictors of offspring's substance use is  . This  examined the associations between offspring's perspectives of fathers' and mothers'   and the polysubstance use ( PSU) in biological and adoptive families by youth and young adults. Long- term influences of the   of fathers and mothers were  investigated by using longitudinal data on offspring's PSU. Results of structural equation modelling analyses showed that offspring's time 1 PSU scores were significantly related to both positive and negative  , whereas overall time 2 PSU scores were more strongly related to offspring's age and gender than . In both time 1 and time 2 models, different paths were found to be significant for paternal and maternal  models. Only adopted offspring PSU scores were found to be significantly influenced by  of both fathers and mothers when offspring became older. These findings confirm: ( a) the uniqueness and potential vulnerability of adopted offspring in relation to PSU, ( b) the difference in influence for fathers' and mothers'  on offspring's PSU, and ( c) the long- term influences of   on adopted offspring."
"Acculturation Gap, Intergenerational Conflict, Parenting Style, and Youth Distress in Immigrant Chinese American Families",2008,"This  examined mother- acculturation gaps in relationship to youth distress and the possible mediating role of - conflict and   in a sample of 81 Chinese American families. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses provided partial support for a relationship between acculturation gaps and youth distress. No mediators of this relationship were found; however, post-hoc analyses indicated that intergenerational conflict and   were associated with youth distress above and beyond acculturation gaps. These  suggest that interventions developed to reduce - conflict and increase al bonding (increase al warmth and decrease al overprotection) may be valuable for Chinese American adolescents, regardless of acculturation gap status."

The sample was composed by 847 pupils (450 male and 397 female) from 9 to 18 years old (M = 12.73; SD = 2.338), from Primary (426) and Secondary (421) schools, from 38 intact groups of 5 schools randomly selected from different Spanish Regions. Results show that those involved in bullying are more rejected, and victims are the most rejected and have lower relationships among pupils. Family context is positively scored. The authoritative al  is the most frequent. Not involved pupils perceive an indulgent  more frequently than involved ones; bullies perceive more negligent and victims more authoritarian or authoritative. The unsteadiness on al  between both s plus been rejected by peers is pointed out as victimization support."
Associations of FKBP5 polymorphisms and methylation and parenting style with depressive symptoms among Chinese adolescents,2021,"Background Genetic factors may interplay with environmental stressors to contribute to risks of depressive symptoms.

Methods This  used a nested case-control  design based on a cohort , and the case (n = 120) and control groups (n = 118) were matched with age. Depressive symptoms,  , and other demographics were measured. Fourteen potential polymorphisms and one promoter region in the FKBP5 gene were selected for genotyping and methylation analysis. Results In the adjusted models, a significant association between FKBP5 rs7757037 and depressive symptoms was found in the codominant model (AG vs. GG; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.56, 95% CI = 1.13-5.78) and dominant model (AA+AG vs. GG; AOR = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.11-5.120); rs2817032 and rs2817035 polymorphisms were associated with depressive symptoms in the codominant model and dominant model. Significant interactions between rs7757037 and the father's   were found in the codominant model (P = 0.043) and dominant model (P = 0.043), but the gene-environment interactions were not significant after correcting for multiple testing. Moreover, the significant main effects of FKBP5 methylation status on depressive symptoms were not observed, and there was no significant interaction between FKBP5 methylation status and   on depressive symptoms. Conclusions Further studies are required to confirm the effect of FKBP5 polymorphisms and methylation as well as their interactions with   in larger samples."
"The examination of authoritarian parenting styles, specific forms of peer-victimization, and reactive aggression in Hong Kong Youth",2018,"This  utilized a hierarchical regression model to explore the relationship between reactive aggression, forms of peer victimization, and authoritarian  . Participants included 1,021 Hong Kong youth and their s (N=1,021), drawn from ten primary schools throughout the municipality. Children completed the Reactive and Proactive Aggression Questionnaire and the Multidimensional Peer Victimization Scale, while s completed the al Styles Dimensions Questionnaire. Results indicated that authoritarian , al use of verbal hostility, verbal victimization by peers, social manipulation, and attacks on property by peers, all significantly contributed to the variance in reactive aggression. Conversely, physical attacks by peers, physical coercion by s, and non-reasoning   were not found to significantly contribute to the regression model. Additionally, gender was found to predict reactive aggression with boys reporting higher scores than girls. The implications of these findings for future , as well as the limitations of this  are discussed."

To date, no  has explored whether youth perceptions of   are heterogeneous in families with a depressed  or whether heterogeneous   are associated with 's internalizing symptoms. Methods Participants were  aged 8-16 years who had a  with major depressive disorder; they were enrolled through their s, who were outpatients at two hospitals in Ningxia.   were measured using the al Bonding Instrument. Youth depression and anxiety were measured using the Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children and the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders, respectively. We applied latent profile analysis to identify the subtypes of   with similar patterns. Differences between subtypes in relation to demographic variables and   scores were calculated using one-way ANOVAs, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, and chi-squared tests. Bivariate logistic analyses were conducted to examine the associations between al bonding subtypes and 's depression and anxiety. Results Four   were identified through latent profile analysis: care-autonomy, overprotection-indifference, indifference, and undifferentiated . Youth with care-autonomy s had a lower risk of depression (OR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.06-0.41) and anxiety (OR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.10-0.48), while indifference  increased 's risk of depression (OR: 5.29; 95% CI: 1.30-21.54) more than undifferentiated . Conclusions Children with a depressed  had heterogeneous perceptions of  . Mothers' and fathers'   were largely congruent. Care-autonomy  (high care and high autonomy) may decrease 's risk of depression, whereas indifference  (low care and autonomy) may increase their risk of depression."

Adolescents' Conflict Resolution Styles Toward Mothers: The Role of Parenting and Personality,2016,"In the  , we examined associations between contextual and individual factors and adolescents' conflict resolution with mothers. In Study 1, we explored links between maternal responsiveness and psychological control and adolescent conflict resolution  (positive problem solving, conflict engagement, withdrawal, and compliance) with two informants. In Study 2, we examined the unique contribution of adolescents' personality above and beyond perceived  in the prediction of conflict resolution . Results of both studies indicated that responsiveness was related positively to problem solving and negatively to withdrawal. Psychological control was positively associated with destructive resolution . Study 2 indicated that extraversion predicted more problem solving and conflict engagement, and less withdrawal. Agreeableness predicted more problem solving and less conflict engagement. Finally, certain personality traits moderated associations between  and conflict resolution, indicating that some adolescents are more sensitive to these  dimensions than others."

Method: Participants were 164 first-generation Chinese immigrant mothers in the United States (M-age = 37.80). Structural equation modeling was used to examine the direct and indirect effects of acculturation on psychological adjustment and . Bootstrapping technique was used to explore the conditional indirect effects of acculturation on  as appropriate. Results: American orientation was strongly associated with positive psychological well-being, which was in turn related to more authoritative  and less authoritarian . Moreover, American and Chinese orientations interacted to predict depressive symptoms, which were in turn associated with more authoritarian . Specifically, American orientation was negatively associated with depressive symptoms only at mean or high levels of Chinese orientation. Conclusions: Results suggest acculturation as a distal contextual factor and psychological adjustment as 1 critical mechanism that transmits effects of acculturation to . Promoting immigrant s' ability and comfort in the new culture independently or in conjunction with encouraging biculturalism through policy intervention efforts appear crucial for the positive adjustment of Chinese immigrant s and ."
"Role of Parents' Socio-Economic Status, Parenting Styles and Alcohol Locus of Control on Alcohol Attitudes",2019,"We assessed the roles of gender, s' socio-economic status (SES),   and alcohol-related locus of control (ALoC) on attitudes towards alcohol use among first-year students in a Nigerian university. In a school-based cross-sectional , 300 first-year university students within the ages of 16 and 31 years with mean age of 21.28 and standard deviation of 2.85 completed copies of a questionnaire. Hierarchical multiple regression showed that being male, high perception of s' SES, low levels of responsiveness, high autonomy-granting, high demanding   and external ALoC were highly predictive of positive alcohol use attitudes and accounted for 41% of the variance. Positive alcohol attitudes were mostly predicted by high level of autonomy-granting and less responsive  , with alcohol-related locus of control recording the lowest contribution. Effective alcohol-related attitudinal change among students should be encouraged while less autonomy-granting and more responsive   should be adopted by s. We recommend especially for the male students, the need to see themselves as capable of controlling alcohol-related attitude and behaviour."
"Good Partner, Good Parent: Responsiveness Mediates the Link Between Romantic Attachment and Parenting Style",2013,"This cross-sectional, dyadic questionnaire  examined the contribution of romantic attachment and responsive caregiving to  , investigating both gender and partner effects. One hundred and twenty-five couples with  aged 7 to 8 years completed measures of attachment , responsive caregiving toward partner, and  . Structural Equation Modeling was used to examine the intra- and interpersonal associations between romantic attachment, caregiving responsiveness, and  . Attachment avoidance and anxiety were both negatively associated with responsive caregiving to partner, which in turn was positively associated with authoritative (optimal)   and negatively associated with authoritarian and permissive (nonoptimal)  . Responsive caregiving mediated all links between attachment and , with an additional direct association between attachment anxiety and nonoptimal   that was not explained by caregiving responsiveness.

Parenting Styles and Health Risk Behavior of Left-Behind Children: The Mediating Effect of Cognitive Emotion Regulation,2020,"Objectives This  is to investigate the role of cognitive emotion regulation in the relationship between   and health risk behavior in left-behind . Methods Totally, 404 left-behind  were surveyed with the Egna Minnen av Barndoms Uppfostran (EMBU), the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire-Chinese Version (CERQ-C) and the Adolescent Health Related Risky Behavior Inventory (AHRBI). Results The  showed that: (1) The health risk behaviors of left-behind  were significantly negatively correlated with authoritative   (r = -0.46 to -0.26, P < 0.01) and positive cognitive emotion regulations (except Acceptance, r = -0.44 to -0.19, P < 0.01), and significantly positively correlated with authoritarian & permissive/neglecting   (r = 0.19-0.40, P < 0.01) and negative cognitive emotion regulations (except Self-blame, r = 0.25-0.52, P < 0.01). (2) Authoritative   were significantly positively correlated with positive cognitive emotion regulations (r = 0.13-0.47, P < 0.01), and significantly negatively correlated with negative cognitive emotion regulations (except Self-blame, r = -0.21 to -0.30, P < 0.01). Authoritarian & permissive/neglecting   were significantly negatively correlated with positive cognitive emotion regulations (r = -0.19 to -0.11, P < 0.05), and significantly positively correlated with negative cognitive emotion regulations (except Self-blame, r = 0.12-0.38, P < 0.05). (3) The structural equation models demonstrated that cognitive emotion regulation served as a partial mediator between authoritative, authoritarian and permissive/neglecting   and the health risk behaviors of left-behind , accounting for the total effect from 7.55% to 66.92%. Conclusions The  suggests that   impact the health risk behaviors in left-behind  mainly via the mediating effect of cognitive emotion regulation."
"Psychosocial risk factors in adolescent tobacco use: Negative mood-states, peer group and parenting styles",2012,"There are multiple factors that can affect the risk of tobacco use in adolescence. By analyzing these factors together we can disentangle the specific relevance of each of them in shaping teenagers' individual behavior. The goal of this   is to deepen our understanding of the relationship between tobacco use in adolescence and socio-demographic and socio-emotional variables. We worked with a reative sample of 2,289 Catalan teenagers (aged 15-18) who responded to a questionnaire drawn up by the Families and Children Panel. Regression models were developed to assess the statistical associations of different mood states (sadness, nervousness and loneliness), peer-group characteristics and  , with tobacco use. The  indicate that addictive behavior is more likely when teenagers show negative mood states, controlling for socio-demographic variables and other risk factors. Among these additional factors, authoritative   reduce the risk of tobacco use, compared to authoritarian, permissive and neglectful . Extensive tobacco use within the peer group is the risk factor most strongly associated with teenagers' individual behavior."

Of the 8 items in the original TPSS, confirmatory factor analysis supported 6-item scale with error correlations was the best-fitting model. Internal consistency was  good for the 6-item scale. Furthermore, support for configural, metric, scalar, residual, and structural invariance emerged across adolescents' perceived maternal and paternal training and across adolescent gender. Results of this  supported the psychometric properties of the 6-item TPSS after taking into account several cautiously considered limitations."
Evaluating the effects of parenting styles dimensions on adolescent drug use: secondary analysis of #Tamojunto randomized controlled trial,2020,"The   examined   dimensions (demandingness and responsiveness) as predictors of adolescent drug use and  evaluated whether   dimensions moderate the effects of the implemented prevention program. 6.391 students in the 7th and 8th grades at 72 Brazilian public schools participated in a three-wave randomized controlled trial to evaluate a school drug-use prevention program. We used structural equation modeling to test if baseline   dimensions (demandingness and responsiveness) would predict the use of drugs (alcohol, binge drinking, cannabis, inhalants, and tobacco) after 21 months. Additionally, we evaluated an interaction version of the above-described model to test if the effect of the prevention program would be moderated by either or both   dimensions. Higher levels of  demandingness predicted lower chances of adolescent drug use (e.g., Cigarette use OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.64-0.89); responsiveness on the five outcomes showed p value superior to 0.01. The effect of the #Tamojunto intervention is unlikely to be conditioned to either   dimensions on the assessed outcomes.

"Modelling parenting styles, moral intelligence, academic self-efficacy and learning motivation among adolescents in grades 7-11",2019,"The current  investigated the associations between three maternal and paternal  , moral intelligence, academic self-efficacy and learning motivation in three serial mediation models. Omani adolescents enrolled in 7th to 11th grades (N = 296) responded to an online survey containing demographic items and scales measuring the variables noted above. Results of Path Analysis indicated that the three models had a good overall fit. In detail, the three paternal  (authoritative, authoritarian and permissive) had direct associations with moral intelligence and indirect associations with learning motivation. However, only two maternal   (i.e., authoritative and authoritarian) correlated directly with learning motivation and these two  did not associate with moral intelligence. All effects were in the hypothesized direction except the effect of authoritative maternal and paternal . Moral intelligence had a positive direct correlation with students' academic self-efficacy and learning motivation. Moral intelligence  mediated the negative associations between three types of fathers'   and students' motivation. Academic self-efficacy had a positive association with students' motivation. These findings provided useful insights about the various association between external factors (e.g.,  ), internal factors (i.e., moral intelligence and self-efficacy) and students' motivation among adolescents in middle and high schools."
Using Structural Equation Modeling and Multidimensional Scaling to Assess Female College Students' Academic Adjustment as a Function of Perceived Parenting Styles,2016,"One understudied aspect of first-year students' transition to college is their relationship with their s.

"Twins, interaction of heredity, bio-social handicaps, and family parenting styles",2001,"The authors stated that mothers of dizygotic twins mostly characterise one of them as generally problematic, while monozygotic twins appear to mothers usually both as problemless. This fact suggest that the differences between monozygotic and dizygotic twins are given not only by heredity but  by the general problematicity (according to mother's judgement) what is probably influenced  by other conditions than the hereditary ones. The studies in twins hitherto did not take this fact into account and that is why they probably somewhat overestimate the role of heredity in the formation of personality traits.

"Parenting styles, feeding styles and food-related parenting practices in relation to toddlers' eating styles: A cluster-analytic approach",2017,"Introduction Toddlers' eating behaviors are influenced by the way s interact with their . The objective of this  was to explore how five major constructs of general  behavior cluster in s of toddlers. These  clusters were further explored to see how they differed in the use of feeding strategies (i.e. feeding  and food  practices) and by reported  eating . Methods An online survey with 1005 mothers/caregivers (legal guardians) with at least one  between 12 and 36 months old was conducted in the United States in 2012, assessing general  behavior, feeding , food  practices and the  eating . Results A three cluster solution of   was found and clusters were labelled as overprotective/supervising, authoritarian, and authoritative. The clusters differed in terms of general  behaviors. Both overprotective and authoritative clusters showed high scores on structure, behavioral control, and nurturance. The overprotective cluster scored high on overprotection. The 'authoritarian' cluster showed lowest levels of nurturance, structure and behavioral control. Overprotective and authoritative s showed very similar patterns in the use of food  practices, e.g. monitoring food intake, modeling, and promoting healthy food intake and availability at home. Overprotective s  reported higher use of pressure to eat and involvement. Authoritarian s reported high use of giving the  control over their food behaviors, emotion regulation, using food as a reward, and controlling food intake for weight control. Children's eating  did not largely vary by  cluster. Conclusion This  showed that a relatively new   of overprotection is relevant for 's eating behaviors. Overprotective s reported food  practices that are known to be beneficial for 's food intake, such as modelling healthy food intake, as well as more unfavorable practices such as pressure. Longitudinal data on  practices and their relation to healthy eating in  is needed to inform communication and interventions for s, reinforcing key feeding strategies which have positive effects on  eating behaviors and addressing   that have unintended negative effects."
Parent emotional distress and feeding styles in low-income families. The role of parent depression and parenting stress,2015,"Purpose: Depression and other stressors have been associated with general  and  out-comes in low-income families. Given that s shape  eating behaviors through their feeding interactions with their , it is important to investigate factors that may influence al feeding of young . The aim of this  was to examine how depressive symptoms and  stress might influence the nature of  feeding  in low-income families. Methods: Questionnaires were completed by 290 African-American and Hispanic s residing in a large urban city in the southwestern United States. Twenty-six percent of the s reported depressive symptoms above the clinical cutoff. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine how depressive symptoms and  stress might influence the nature of  feeding . Results: After adjusting for potential confounding variables (e.g., ethnicity, education, age), s with an uninvolved feeding  reported less positive affect and more  stress than s showing the other three feeding  authoritative, authoritarian, and indulgent. Conclusions: Because feeding  tend to be associated with  obesity in low income samples, the  of this  provide important information regarding the   eating dynamic that may promote less optimal  eating behaviors and the development of hood obesity. This information could be useful for prevention studies aimed at changing  behaviors that negatively impact the socialization of  eating behaviors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Parenting style and mental disorders in a nationally representative sample of US adolescents,2018,"We examined associations between   and past-year mental disorders in a nationally reative cross-sectional survey of US adolescents and whether the associations differed by adolescent demographic characteristics. The sample included 6483 adolescents aged 13-18 years who were interviewed for a full range of DSM-IV mental disorders.   was assessed by adolescent-reported maternal and paternal care and control using items from the al Bonding Instrument. We controlled for socio-demographics, al history of mental disorders, stressful life events, sexual violence, inter-al conflict, and household composition. We  tested for two-way interactions between al care and control and adolescent age, sex, and race/ethnicity. In adjusted models, high maternal care was associated with lower odds of depressive, eating, and behavioral disorders, and high maternal control was associated with greater odds of depressive, anxiety, eating, and behavioral disorders. High paternal care was associated with lower odds of social phobia and alcohol abuse/dependence. High paternal control was associated with greater odds of agoraphobia and alcohol abuse/dependence but with lower odds of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Associations of maternal and paternal control with anxiety disorders and substance abuse/dependence differed by sex. High paternal care was associated with lower odds of anxiety disorders only among Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks. Perceived al care and control were associated with adolescent mental disorders after controlling for multiple potential confounders. Differential patterns of association were found according to adolescent sex and race/ethnicity. Findings have implications for prevention and intervention programs that incorporate familial contextual factors."

Method: 58  with ADHD and 30 healthy  were included in this . All  were assessed by The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged ChildrenPresent and Lifetime Version. ADHD symptom severity was assessed by The Conners  Rating Scale and The Conners Teacher Rating Scale. The  Style Inventory (PSI) and The al Attitude Research Instrument (PARI) were used to assess   of mothers. Results: ADHD group had lower scores on two subscales of PSI (acceptance/involvement and strictness/supervision) and democratic attitude and equality subscale of PARI and higher scores on strict discipline subscale of PARI compared to control group. In ADHD group, higher symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder were associated with higher mother's strict discipline scores and lower  reported mother's acceptance/involvement scores. Conclusion: Our findings supported the idea that there may be an association between  attitudes and ADHD symptoms in families having a  with ADHD. These  indicated the importance of integrated approach to ADHD diagnosis and treatment and evaluating the  with ADHD in the context of family environment."

Parenting attitudes and practices of immigrant Chinese mothers of adolescents,1998,"Chinese  has historically been seen as more authoritarian than mainstream American culture. Recent  suggests that authoritarian  may be a Western concept that does not accurately depict Chinese socialization. This exploratory  sought qualitative information on the   of Chinese immigrants. Results revealed central themes of watchful and subtle influence to conform with al expectations. These expectations arose from s' desires for their  to succeed and be good people. Thus, aspects of Chinese  that have traditionally been ascribed to an authoritarian  may stem from an entirely different set of  attitudes and beliefs that are culturally-based."

We found that the sibling relations among first-born  in rural areas in northern China had moderate quality and were typically warm. There was a degree of correlation between the sibling relations of these  and  , and the democratic   was the most commonly used. The data confirm that the   of rural s can predict rural 's sibling relations."
"Locus of control, perceived parenting style, and symptoms of anxiety and depression in  with Tourette's syndrome",2008,"Aim This  explored the contribution of two psychosocial factors, locus of control (LOC) and perceived  , to symptoms of internalizing disorders in  with Tourette syndrome (TS). This contribution was further evaluated in relation to TS severity. Methods Sixty-five  (53 boys, 12 girls) ages 9.0-16.9 years, of normal intelligence, completed questionnaires evaluating their depression and anxiety symptoms, LOC, and maternal  . Their mothers rated TS severity, determined by tic severity, symptoms of attention-deficit hypreactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive compulsive symptoms (OCS) Results Higher rates of symptoms of anxiety and depression were associated with a more external LOC and a more rejecting and controlling  . Additionally, depression correlated significantly with tic severity, ADHD and OCS, whereas anxiety correlated only with ADHD symptoms and OCS, but not with tics. Regression analyses showed that LOC, OCS and ADHD symptoms each significantly contributed to predicting anxiety level, whereas LOC and ADHD symptoms significantly contributed to predicting depression symptoms. Conclusions Rates of symptoms of anxiety and depression in  with TS are markedly influenced by psychosocial factors, extending beyond the influence of ADHD and OCD, both common comorbid disorders in TS. An internal LOC, which is associated with an accepting and autonomy-granting  , appears to be a protective factor against anxiety and depression."
Perceived Parenting Styles and Emotional Intelligence Among Adolescents in Vietnam,2020,"Emotional intelligence (EI) has a significant role in psychological well-being and is affected by  . There is no evidence about this relationship in countries with the impact of Confucianism and feudalism, in which s use authoritarian caregiving to foster their . The aim of the current  was to examine the association between   and EI among Vietnamese adolescents. This is a cross-sectional school survey using multilevel regression analyses controlling for potential confounders and school cluster effects. The principal data sources were the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Adolescent Short Form, which has been translated into Vietnamese, and the locally validated al Bonding Instrument, which assesses three main  : warmth, overprotectiveness, and authoritarianism. Results from 1,593 students revealed that boys had significantly higher overall EI, Well-Being, and Self-Control subscale scores than girls. The warmth of s during hood was associated with higher EI, while overprotectiveness and authoritarianism from mothers were associated with lower EI among adolescents. This  supports the impact of   on EI. The warmth and care from both mother and father will benefit the emotional development of their  in Vietnam."
The Influence of Parenting Style and Time Management Tendency on Internet Gaming Disorder among Adolescents,2020,"The problem of adolescent online gaming addiction is related to individual-level characteristics and the influence of the family environment. The   explores the potential role of adolescents' time management tendency in mediating the relationship between   and adolescent internet gaming disorder (IGD). Responses from a total of 357 Chinese high school students were collected for a Pathological Video-Game Use Questionnaire, Simplified  Styles Scale, and Time Management Tendency Scale. Overall, participants reported moderate use of online games (Mean = 1.41; SD = 0.41), lower than the median value of 2 on a three-point scale. In terms of the mediating role of adolescents' time management tendency, full meditation was observed for the relationship between the   factor of s' emotional warmth for both mothers and fathers and internet gaming disorder. The  highlight the benefits of emotional warmth in supporting self-efficacy, self-control, and autonomy through the promotion of time management, which is an important protective factor for IGD and can serve as a mediating personality variable. Although non-significant in the complete model, over-protection and rejection by s should  be cautiously considered as potential risk factors related to addiction."
"REJECTION SENSITIVITY LEVELS WITH RESPECT TO ATTACHMENT STYLES, GENDER, AND PARENTING STYLES: A STUDY WITH TURKISH STUDENTS",2009,"The effects of attachment  of a group of university students on their rejection sensitivity levels in relation to gender, and   were investigated. Instruments used were the Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire (Downey & Feldman, 1996), and the Relationship Scales Questionnaire (Griffin & Bartholomew, 1994). To analyze data, F statistics, t test, regression analysis, and correlation analysis were employed. Rejection sensitivity levels of female students who had fearful attachment  and of students who experienced authoritarian   were found to be significantly higher than those of others. Effect of attachment  on rejection sensitivity and relationship between rejection sensitivity and attachment  were both found to be significant."
Revisiting a neglected construct: parenting styles in a -feeding context,2005,"The extent to which general  res feeding  in ethnically diverse populations is not well documented. Existing measures of  feeding have focused almost exclusively on specific behaviors of European-American s. A valid and reliable instrument was developed to identify feeding  in s of low-income minority preschoolers. Two hundred thirty-one s (130 Hispanic; 101 African-American) completed questionnaires on feeding practices and  . Based on self-reported feeding behavior, s were assigned to four feeding  (authoritarian, n=84; authoritative, n=34; indulgent, n=80; anduninvolved, n=33). Convergent validity was evaluated by relating feeding  to independent measures of general  and authoritarian feeding practices. Authoritarian feeding  were associated with higher levels of general al control and authoritarian feeding practices. Alternatively, authoritative feeding  were associated with higher levels of general al responsiveness. Among the two permissive feeding , Hispanic s were more likely to be indulgent, whereas African-American s were more likely to be uninvolved. Further, differences were found among the feeding  on an independent measure of 's body mass index. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Parenting Styles and Emotion Regulation: The Role of Behavioral and Psychological Control During Young Adulthood,2009,"This  examined the relations between maternal   (including warmth, behavioral control, and psychological control) and young adults' emotion regulation. Participants included 246 young adults from a large Midwestern university, as well as their mothers. Higher levels of maternal control, particularly psychological control, were related to lower levels of young adults' emotion regulation. This  is among the first to explore the above relations within the context of young adulthood. Limitations and clinical implications are discussed."
"Non-Child-Related Family Stress, Parenting Styles, and Behavior Problems in School-Age Girls Adopted from China",2015," has been conceptualized to mediate or moderate 's adaptation to family stress. Our  expanded the literature to determine, within the adoptive context, how non--related family stress (NCR-family stress; e.g., 's problems at work) and   were related to internalizing and externalizing problems in school-age girls adopted from China. Using data from the third wave of a longitudinal , 651 school-age girls were identified for the current analysis. On average, the girls were 9.3 years old (SD = 2.7) and were adopted at 15.6 months (SD = 13.8). Data on NCR-family stress,   and  behavior problems were collected from the adoptive mothers using the social problem questionnaire,   and dimensions questions, and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/6-18), respectively. After controlling for age at adoption, age, the adoptive mother's education level, household income, and the girls' corresponding behavior problems from the second wave of data (2 years prior), we found that that the association between NCR-family stress and the adopted Chinese girls' internalizing problems and externalizing problems was mediated by authoritarian  and moderated by authoritative ."
Mediating and Moderating Processes in the Associations Between Chinese Immigrant Mothers' Acculturation and Parenting Styles in the United States,2019,"This  utilized a moderated mediation model to examine the following: (a) the mediating role of Chinese immigrant mothers' psychological well-being in the association between their acculturation and   and (b) the moderating role of mothers' ethnic identity resolution in the relation between their acculturation and psychological well-being. Participants included 210 first-generation Chinese immigrant mothers (M-age = 37.70; SD = 4.46) with young  (M-age = 4.54; SD = 0.88; 48% female) in the United States. Mothers reported on their acculturation toward the mainstream American culture, ethnic identity resolution, psychological well-being, and  . Chinese immigrant mothers' greater behavioral participation in American culture was associated with more positive psychological well-being. In two, better psychological well-being in mothers was associated with less reported engagement in authoritarian  and more authoritative . Moreover, mothers' ethnic identity resolution moderated the association between their American acculturation level and psychological well-being. Specifically, the indirect effect of mothers' American acculturation on their   through psychological well-being was stronger for mothers with higher levels of ethnic identity resolution. This  highlighted the importance of examining the interplay between ethnic identity and acculturation in promoting the psychological well-being and positive  of Chinese immigrant mothers in the United States."
Parenting style and psychosocial outcomes in a sample of Jamaican adolescents,2013,"We examined the relationship between   and adolescents' psychological and behavioural well-being in the Jamaican context. Consistent with pertinent studies from western societies, our data indicated that authoritarian  was associated with diminished psychological and behavioural adjustment, such that adolescents who reported their s as more authoritarian  reported a greater risk of anger depression, suicide ideation, and conduct problems. Further, gender moderated the effect of authoritarian  on conduct problems, with the association being significantly greater for boys than for girls. Additionally, adolescents' agreement with s'  of  moderated the association between authoritarian  and adolescents' psychological distress, such that when adolescents disagreed with their s'  behaviours, adolescents were more likely to exhibit psychosocial problems. We discussed our findings within the context of cultural socialisation processes and the probable influence of globalisation on traditional cultural values and attitudes. We  noted implications for social policies."
Race Socialization and Parenting Styles: Links to Delinquency for African American and White Adolescents,2016,"This  investigated differences in the use of authoritarian  (AP), a race socialization practice among high-risk African American s and compared it to authoritative  (ATP) a  found efficacious for White adolescents. Data from the Rochester Youth Development Study are used inclusive of African American (n = 413) and White (n = 114) adolescents. Risk for delinquency is measured by six factors. ATP includes al responsiveness and monitoring, and AP added restrictive al control. Multivariate regression models were used to assess main and interaction effects of the   with cumulative risk. Findings indicated ATP is a racially and class invariant  rearing  that reduces delinquency."
Influence of perceived parenting styles: Goal orientations and career aspirations of high school science students in Thailand,2016,"There has been considerable  interest into the relationship between the   of Asians, and student motivation and achievement. The investigation ed in this paper contributes to the literature in this area by examining the influence of perceived   on goal orientations and career aspirations of a sample of high school science students in Thailand (N = 2638). Results from a multiple regression analysis show several significant findings: students who perceived their s as empathic were more likely to have adopted mastery goals and empathic  had a particularly positive influence on females' career aspirations. Students who perceived that their s have domineering views were more likely to have adopted performance avoidance goals. Students who perceived that their s are the regulators of family rules were more likely to adopt both mastery and performance goals. These findings are discussed in light of social dimensions of achievement goals and gender roles."
The effects of parenting styles and parental positivity on preschoolers' self-perception,,"Self-esteem has implications for a wide variety of psychological problems. This  sought to determine whether  practices at ages 3 and 4 years contributed to 5-year-old 's self-perception, a precursor to later self-esteem. Data came from a longitudinal  in which preschool twin or triplet  were tested within a month of their birthdays; complete data were available for 263  tested at ages 4 and 5 years and for 211  tested at ages 3 and 5 years. As part of testing at ages 3 and 4,  and s engaged in a puzzle task for 10 min; their behaviors were coded by trained raters.  variables of verbal warmth, positive affect, permissive discipline, and sensitivity were coded. At age 5, 's self-perception was assessed using the Pictorial Scale of Perceived Competence and Social Acceptance for Young Children. Results showed that al positive affect and sensitivity at age 4 predicted increased maternal acceptance at age 5, and permissive discipline predicted decreased peer acceptance scores for girls, but not boys. Additionally, al verbal warmth at age 3 predicted higher peer acceptance scores at age 5. Finally, boys who experienced increases in  positive affect from ages 3 to 4 showed higher peer acceptance scores at age 5. This  provides evidence that  is an important factor in the development of preschool 's self-perception."
"PARENTING STYLES IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS: A STUDY FROM THE PRINCESS MOTHER NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE TREATMENT, THAILAND",2017,"To  the   of primary caregivers of  and adolescents with substance use disorders and to examine the association between   and al education level and  income. Methods: This cross-sectional  was conducted on 257  and adolescent participants (<20 years old), who were diagnosed with substance use disorders, through questionnaires. Participants were recruited from patients who was in treatment for substance use disorders at the Princess Mother National Institute on Drug Abuse Treatment in Pathumthani, Thailand. Descriptive statistical analyses were used to examine   and Chi square to examine associations between   and al education level and  income. Results: A total of 257 participants recruited were consisting of 226 (87.9%) male participants with an average age of 16.8 +/- 1.6 years old. An average age of first-time drug use was 14.6 +/- 1.4 years old. The most regularly used substances were: amphetamine (101 participants; 39.3%), marijuana (70 participants; 27.2%), and other drugs (86 participants; 33.5%).   that participants had received from the primary caregivers were; authoritative (115 participants; 52.5%), neglectful (57 participants; 26.0%), permissive (18 participants; 8.2%), and authoritarian (29 participants; 13.2%). A significantly larger number of participants had neglectful s while a significantly lower number of participants had permissive s than in Thai general population (26.0% versus 12.4%, 8.2% versus 22.8%, respectively, p < 0.001). Additionally, there were no significant associations between   and al education level or  income. Conclusion: In comparison to the general population, a higher number of participants within this  had a neglectful primary caregiver while fewer numbers of participants had a permissive primary caregiver."
PARENTING SENSE OF COMPETENCE: ATTACHMENT STYLE AND SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS,2021,"This  aimed at exploring some s' personal characteristics which may impact the  Sense of Competence (PSC). Online questionnaires assessing s' PSC (QAECEP) and attachment  (RSQ), as well as a sociodemographic questionnaire, were proposed to 139 participants from the general population (including 60 fathers). s with an insecure attachment  report a lower PSC than secure s. s' age and number of  living at home correlated positively with the PSC. s with an insecure attachment are more likely to have difficulties in the perception of their  role. This  reveals that, beyond s' personal characteristics, other factors influence the PSC. s' attachment and the 's characteristics have to be considered when offering care and guidance for s who face difficulties in their role."
Resting Heart Rate Mediates the Relationship between Parenting Style and Callous-Unemotional Traits in Chinese Children,2021,"Despite increasing knowledge of social and biological risk factors for callous-unemotional (CU) traits, relatively less is known about how these two sets of risk factors combine to affect these traits. The current longitudinal  investigated pathways from   to CU traits via resting heart rate in a three-year project. s of 382  completed the  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire at Time 1 ( Mean age = 9.06, SD = 0.94, range = 7-11 years), with the heart rate data collected at Time 2 (M = 10.16, SD = 0.93, range = 8-13 years) and CU traits assessed at Time 3 (M = 11.06, SD = 0.94, range = 9-13 years). We found that   and CU traits were associated with resting heart rate, and that structural equation modeling showed resting heart rate to partially mediate the effect of   on CU traits. Specifically, higher levels of authoritarian  were associated with lower resting heart rate, which in turn was linked to higher level of CU traits. On the contrary,  in the context of authoritative  showed relatively higher resting heart rate, which was predictive of lower CU traits. Overall, findings have implications for understanding the etiology of CU traits in  and developing effective prevention programs for  with affective deficits."
Hong Kong Chinese Adolescents' Self-Reported Smoking and Perceptions of Parenting Styles,2015,"Background Adolescent smoking has been associated with general  , although potential differences between fathers and mothers were seldom investigated, especially in non-Western populations. Purpose The aim of this  is to investigate associations between Hong Kong adolescents' smoking and their perceptions of paternal and maternal  . Method In a school-based survey in 2006-2007, 33,408 adolescents (44.6 % boys; mean age 14.5 +/- 1.3 years) provided information on smoking and the frequency of care and control by each , who was classified into one of four adolescent-reported  : authoritative (high care, high control), authoritarian (low care, high control), permissive (high care, low control), or neglectful (low care, low control). Logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of current smoking (past 30 days) for  variables, considering potential effect modification by age, sex and al smoking. Results Maternal care and control were strongly and significantly associated with lower odds of adolescent current smoking. However, such association was weak for paternal care and observed only in girls. Conversely, paternal control was positively associated with current smoking, especially if the father smoked. The lowest AORs of current smoking were associated with authoritative mothers, permissive fathers and combinations of maternal and paternal   with an authoritative mother whether or not the father was authoritative. Conclusion Maternal care, control and authoritative  were associated with lower odds of adolescent smoking in Hong Kong. Paternal care was only weakly associated with lower odds of adolescent smoking, and paternal control was even associated with higher odds of smoking."
Preschooler obesity and parenting styles of mothers and fathers: Australian National Population Study,2007,"OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this work was to determine relationships between BMI status at ages 4 to 5 years and mothers' and fathers'  dimensions and  . PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS. Participants were composed of all 4983 of the 4- to 5-year-old  in wave 1 of the nationally reative Longitudinal Study of Australian Children with complete BMI and maternal  data. Mothers and fathers self-reported their  behaviors on 3 multi-item continuous scales ( warmth, control, and irritability) and were each categorized as having 1 of 4   ( authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and disengaged) using internal warmth and control tertile cut points. Using a proportional odds model, odds ratios for  being in a higher BMI category were computed for mothers and fathers separately and together, after adjustment for factors associated with  BMI, including mothers' and fathers' BMI status. RESULTS. The sample was composed of 2537 boys and 2446 girls with a mean age 56.9 months; 15% were overweight and 5% were obese ( International Obesity Task Force criteria). Mothers'  behaviors and  were not associated in any model with higher odds of  being in a heavier BMI category, with or without multiple imputation to account for missing maternal BMI data. Higher father control scores were associated with lower odds of the  being in a higher BMI category. Compared with the reference authoritative ,  of fathers with permissive and disengaged   had higher odds of being in a higher BMI category. CONCLUSIONS. This article is the first, to our knowledge, to examine the  of both s in relation to preschoolers' BMI status while  adjusting for al BMI status. Fathers' but not mothers'  behaviors and  were associated with increased risks of preschooler overweight and obesity. Longitudinal impacts of  on BMI gain remain to be determined."
Alcohol use and abuse and motivations for drinking and non-drinking among Spanish adolescents: do we know enough when we know parenting style?,2020,"Objective: We examine   (characterized by warmth and strictness, i.e., neglectful, indulgent, authoritarian and authoritative) as either a protective or risk factor for adolescence drinking. Design: Two 4???2???3 multi-factorial MANOVAs. Sample consisted of 996 underage Spanish adolescents, 532 males (53.4%), ranging from 15 to 17?years old. Main outcome measures: Alcohol use (wine, beer, mixed drinks and liquors) and abuse and motivations for drinking (social acceptance and self-enhancement) and non-drinking (harsh preventive rules and awareness of alcohol's harmful effects). Results: Lower risk of alcohol use and abuse was found in adolescents with indulgent , and higher risk for adolescents with authoritarian . Adolescents from indulgent   homes had equal adjustment (lower self-enhancement and higher harsh preventive rules and awareness of alcohol's harmful effects) or even better (lower social acceptance) than those from authoritative   homes. Consistently, the highest risk   identified were the authoritarian and neglectful  (?=.05). Conclusion: At least in some cultures, warmth and reasoning, shared by authoritative and indulgent  , seem the recommended way to protect offspring from drinking. Effective alcohol prevention and intervention programs should include strategies tailored specifically to this new cultural context where  takes place."
Temperament and Problematic Internet Use in Adolescents: A Moderated Mediation Model of Maladaptive Cognition and Parenting Styles,2015,"The   investigated the mechanisms underlying the relation between temperament (i.e., effortful control, sensation seeking, and dispositional anger/frustration) and adolescent problematic internet use (PIU) by examining the mediating role of maladaptive cognition toward internet use in linking temperament and PIU and the moderating role of   in influencing the mediation. A total of 660 Chinese middle-school adolescents completed anonymous questionnaires regarding temperament, maladaptive cognition toward internet use, maternal  , and PIU. After controlling for gender, age, and family socioeconomic status, it was found that effortful control was negatively related to PIU, whereas sensation seeking and anger/frustration were positively related to PIU. Moreover, maladaptive cognition partially mediated the relation of effortful control and dispositional anger/frustration to PIU and completely mediated the relation of sensation seeking to PIU. Moderated mediation analyses further revealed that authoritative and permissive   moderated the relation between sensation seeking and maladaptive cognition. Specifically, in adolescents with low authoritative or low permissive mothers, sensation seeking promoted maladaptive cognition, whereas in adolescents with high authoritative or high permissive mothers, sensation seeking no longer predicted PIU. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed."
Associations of parental feeding styles with  snacking behaviour and weight in the context of general parenting,2014,"Objective To examine cross-sectional and longitudinal (one-year follow-up) associations of al feeding  with  snacking behaviour and weight in the context of general , taking into account the multidimensionality of the controlling feeding . Design Linear regression analyses were performed. s completed a questionnaire to measure five feeding  dimensions (Instrumental Feeding, Emotional Feeding, Encouragement, Overt Control and Covert Control) and 's fruit, energy-dense snack and sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intakes. Children's height and weight were measured to calculate their BMI Z-scores. Moderation by   was tested by adding interaction terms to the regression analyses. Setting Observational  in the Netherlands. Subjects - dyads (n 1275) participating in the INPACT (IVO Nutrition and Physical Activity Child cohorT) ;  were (on average) 9 years of age. Results Instrumental Feeding and Emotional Feeding were negatively related to  fruit intake one year later and positively to (changes in)  energy-dense snack intake. Encouragement was negatively related to  energy-dense snacking and SSB intake one year later. Overt Control was cross-sectionally and prospectively related to (changes in)  energy-dense snacking and SSB intake in a negative direction. Covert Control showed similar associations with  energy-dense snacking and SSB intake as Overt Control. Although Covert Control was  positively related to  fruit intake and (changes in)  BMI Z-score, bootstrapping analyses revealed only a differential effect of Overt Control and Covert Control on  BMI Z-score one year later, with Covert Control displaying a stronger, positive association. Moderation analyses showed that some significant associations between al feeding  and outcome measures were dependent on the degree of psychological control and behavioural control. Conclusions Instrumental Feeding and Emotional Feeding may have a detrimental impact on 's snacking behaviour, while Encouragement, Overt Control and Covert Control may lead to less energy-dense snacking and less SSB intake. Overt Control and Covert Control have differential effects on  BMI Z-score one year later, which supports the idea that they should be treated as separate constructs. Prospective studies with a longer follow-up may elucidate the causal pathways between the various feeding  and 's snacking behaviour and weight, as well as the moderating influences of psychological and behavioural control."
Religious/spiritual struggles and perceived parenting style in a religious college-aged sample,2019,"- interactions shape 's internal working models (IWMs) i.e., their understanding of themselves, others, and close relationships, including with the Divine. Positive IWM are related to less interpersonal and intrapersonal distress. The quality of a 's IWM is  related to various aspects of religion/spirituality (r/s). While r/s benefit many people, some experience struggle around r/s issues. Our  explores the relationship between perceived   and r/s struggles among Catholic college students (n = 464). Results suggest that increased al warmth, involvement, and autonomy support are related to decreases in overall r/s struggle. Regression analyses found that maternal warmth was the strongest unique predictor of overall r/s struggle as well as each subscale, except Demonic. Subsequent analyses regrading Moral struggles found that increases in both subscales of scrupulosity (Fear of God's Punishment and Fear of Having Sinned) independently predicted more Moral struggle. Clinical implications are discussed and  considerations are proposed."
Objective assessment of parenting styles and expectations of couples with young ,2008,"The purposes of the   were to determine the frequency of   in couples with same  versus different , to analyze differences between these groups, and to explore their al expectations. A demandingness-responsiveness model was chosen, and it was operationalized by means of an objective measure of discipline and nurturing practices. In the  participated 485 couples with young . Results revealed more indulgent s in couples with the same . Among s who didn't share  , there were more authoritarian mothers and more authoritative fathers. Authoritative couples, with the exception of indulgent couples, had more nurturing practices and the highest developmental expectations among  and groups. This  highlights the need of more Latin-American ."
Punitive Parenting Style and Psychological Problems in Childhood: The Moderating Role of Warmth and Temperament,2019,"Punitive   has been identified as a risk factor for the development of internalizing and externalizing problems in hood. However, its effect might depend on  temperament and the combined use of punishment with other  forms such as warmth. This longitudinal  assessed whether three temperament traits (negative affectivity, positive affectivity, and effortful control), as well as al warmth moderated the association between punishment and  internalizing and externalizing problems. Five-hundred and seventy-two  (mean age at wave 1: 8.47 years; 45% girls) and their s participated in the two waves (8 month apart) of the . Children completed measures of depression, somatization, rule breaking, aggressive behavior, and  . s completed measures assessing their 's temperament traits (negative affectivity, positive affectivity, and effortful control) and problems. Punishment predicted an increase in all problems over time. al warmth predicted a decrease in depression and somatization. Positive affectivity predicted an increase of aggressive behavior. Negative affectivity moderated the predictive association between punishment and externalizing symptoms, with the detrimental effect of punishment being higher among  high in negative affectivity. In addition, the damaging role of punishment on depression was higher when both warmth and effortful control were high. In boys, punishment predicted higher depression when both warmth and negative affectivity were higher. Results suggest that punishment is uniquely associated with an increase in externalizing and internalizing problems, even though some interactions between temperament, warmth and punishment can exacerbate or diminish direct associations between punishment and 's psychological symptoms."
Maternal parenting styles and ecological momentary assessment of maternal feeding practices and  food intake across middle hood to early adolescence,2020,"Background Maternal   are salient trait-based factors associated with pediatric obesity risk. The purpose of this  was to examine the longitudinal associations of maternal   and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) measures of maternal feeding practices and  food intake across middle hood to early adolescence. Methods Mother- dyads (n = 186;Mbaseline  age = 10.03 +/- 0.89) enrolled in a six-wave bi-annual longitudinal . At baseline, mothers completed a self-report measure of  . At each of the six waves, mothers and  completed EMA prompts of  practices and food intake, respectively, for eight days. Results Children of mothers who reported a more permissive  consumed more pastries/sweets. Children of mothers who reported a more authoritative  decreased likelihood of pastry/sweets consumption with age, and  of mothers who reported a less authoritative  increased likelihood of pastry/sweets consumption with age. The likelihood of fruit/vegetable consumption decreased with age among  of mothers who reported a more authoritarian , and the likelihood increased among  of mothers with a less authoritarian . Mothers who either reported a more authoritarian  or a less authoritative  were more likely to report using food as a reward. Discussion Results highlight the importance of maternal   in relation to  food intake and instrumental feeding."
"A Third Emerging Stage for the Current Digital Society? Optimal Parenting Styles in Spain, the United States, Germany, and Brazil",2019,"We propose a new paradigm with three historical stages for an optimal   (i.e., indulgent  ), which extends the traditional paradigm of only two stages (i.e., authoritarian and authoritative  ). The three stages concur, at the same time, in different environments, context, and cultures. We studied the third stage for optimal - relationships through the offspring's personal and social well-being, with four adolescent samples from 11 to 19 years old (52.2% girls) from Spain (n = 689), the United States (n = 488), Germany (n = 606), and Brazil (n = 672). The offspring's personal well-being was measured through self-esteem (academic, social, emotional, family, and physical), while social well-being was measured with the internalization of self-transcendence (universalism and benevolence) and conservation values (security, conformity, and tradition). The -   was measured through al warmth and strictness, and the adolescents' s were classified into one of four groups (indulgent, authoritarian, authoritative, and neglectful). Remarkably, the greatest personal well-being was found for adolescents raised with higher al warmth and lower al strictness (i.e., indulgent), and the greatest social well-being was found for adolescents raised with higher al warmth (i.e., indulgent and authoritative; p < 0.05 for all countries). Consistently, poorer personal well-being and social well-being were associated with less al warmth (i.e., authoritarian and neglectful). Findings suggest that the - relationships analyzed have a common pattern associated with personal and social well-being that coincide with a proposed third stage."
"The Relationship Between Parenting Style, Gender and Academic Achievement with Optimism Among Turkish Adolescents",2016,"The   aimed to investigate optimism levels of Turkish adolescents aged between 14 and 18 and its relation with  , gender, and academic achievement. The sample consisted of 1353 students (708 male, 645 female) who volunteered to participate in the  from three high schools in Ankara, Turkey. The Life Orientation Test and al Attitude Scale were used as the data collection instruments. The  of ANOVA indicated that the adolescents who had higher academic achievement had higher levels of optimism than those who had lower academic achievement. Moreover, the  of this  showed that the adolescents who perceived their s as authoritative had relatively higher levels of optimism than those who perceived their s as authoritarian and neglectful. Results of this   indicated that the adolescents who characterize their s as permissive had a relatively higher level of optimism than those who characterize their s as neglectful and authoritarian."
Mental health among Vietnamese urban late adolescents: The association of parenting styles,2020,"The aim of this  was to explore the correlation between al  and mental problems among Vietnamese high school students. In total, 16.4 percent of 757 eligible participants reported mental difficulties. Findings showed that being female and in grade 12 were risk factors to mental problems while living in Hue city was likely as a protective factor. The father's warmth reduced the risk of having mental problems among adolescents, while an overprotective mother increased the risk. There was no correlation between authoritarianism of both mother and father and mental difficulties. These  suggest that a  program for s might reduce the risk of mental problems among Vietnamese youth."
Authoritarian Versus Authoritative Parenting Styles: Application of the Cost Equalization Principle,2008,"Given the lack of appropriate theoretical analysis in past  on , this article aims to offer solid theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of authoritative  over authoritarian  by introducing the behavioral-structural model based on the principle of cost equalization. The  of computer simulation using the new theoretical model demonstrate that authoritarian  leads to development of a competitive/hostile structure where the 's spontaneous initiation is discouraged and the overall support within the dyad decreases, whereas authoritative  leads to development of a cooperative/friendly structure where the 's spontaneous initiation is encouraged and the overall support within the dyad increases. Implications of  socialization in competitive versus cooperative structures as predicted by the new theoretical model are  discussed."
"Investigating the interplay between parenting dimensions and styles, and the association with adolescent outcomes",2020,"Research has indicated that a strictly dimensional or al  approach does not capture the full complexity of . To better understand this complexity, the current  combined these two approaches using a novel statistical technique, i.e., subspace K-means clustering. Four objectives were addressed. First, the  tried to identify meaningful groups of s in longitudinal adolescent reports on  behaviour. Second, the dimensional structure of every cluster was inspected to uncover differences in  between and within clusters. Third, the   were compared on several adolescent characteristics. Fourth, to examine the impact of change in   over time, we looked at the cluster membership over time. Longitudinal questionnaire data were collected at three annual waves, with 1,116 adolescents (mean age = 13.79 years) at wave 1. Based on five  dimensions (support and proactive, punitive, psychological and harsh control), subspace K-means clustering, analysed per wave separately, identified two clusters (authoritative and authoritarian ) in which  dimensions were interrelated differently. Authoritative  seemed to be beneficial for adolescent development (less externalising problem behaviour and higher self-concept). Longitudinal data revealed several  group trajectories which showed differential relations with adolescent outcomes. Change in membership from the authoritative cluster to the authoritarian cluster was associated with a decrease in self-concept and an increase in externalising problem behaviour, whereas changes from the authoritarian cluster to the authoritative cluster were associated with an increase in self-concept and a decrease in externalising problem behaviour."
Parenting style and parental monitoring with information communication technology: A study on Japanese junior high school students and their parents,2011,"Data were collected from 286 pairs of Japanese junior high school students and their s to explore the association between   and the intention to use monitoring systems incorporating advanced information technology such as GPS devices and IC cards. Results indicated that a majority of the participants had not experienced advanced monitoring systems, but more than half of the s had some degree of intention to use them. The relationship between the intention to use monitoring systems and two types of   (i.e., responsiveness and control) reported by both s and  was investigated. Categorical regression analyses revealed that   was a predictor of the intention to use monitoring systems, with -reported control being the most significant predictor of s' intention to use. Child-reported responsiveness  had a significant positive effect on 's intention to use, whereas -reported control did not have such an effect. It became clear that   was differently affected the intention to use advanced monitoring systems between s and ; the significant predictor of s' intention to use is their tendency of control and that of 's to use is their perceived responsiveness.

"Short leash or long leash? Parenting style, initial strategic clarity, and the development of venture learning proficiency",2020,"Corporate venture development suggests that internal corporate ventures (ICVs) must become proficient learners if they are to cope successfully with the uncertainty inherent to their operations. Accordingly, the  corporations in which ICVs operate are challenged to identify and enact appropriate   that foster their ICVs' learning proficiency. The current  of 145 ICVs in 72 corporations builds on  theory to theorize that ICVs demonstrate the greatest learning proficiency when corporate s give them a leash length-indicated via observed levels of top management support and operational decision-making autonomy-depending on the degree of strategic clarity under which the ICV was founded."
The relationship between parenting styles and self-congruence of undergraduate students: Core self-evaluation as a mediator,2020,"We investigated the relationships between   and 's core self-evaluation and self-congruence, and further explored the mediating effect of 's core self-evaluation in the relationship between   and self-congruence. The survey participants were 385 undergraduate students at four public universities in Shandong, China. The  show that the students' perception of al rejection and overprotection were positively correlated with their self-congruence, and that al emotional warmth and students' core self-evaluation were negatively related to their self-congruence. Further, students' core self-evaluation partially mediated the relationship between their perception of al overprotection/emotional warmth and their self-congruence. We determined that the mechanism of the effect of   on self-congruence was as follows: High levels of al overprotection or low levels of emotional warmth reduce the level of core self-evaluation of undergraduate students, which further contributes to inconsistency in their self-congruence."
Parenting Style Is Related to Executive Dysfunction After Brain Injury in Children,2011,"Objective: The goal of this  was to examine how   (authoritarian, authoritative, permissive) and family functioning are related to behavioral aspects of executive function following traumatic brain injury (TBI) in young . Method: Participants included 75  with TB! and 97  with orthopedic injuries (OI), ages 3-7 years at injury. Pre-injury  behavior and family functioning were assessed shortly after injury, and postinjury executive functions were assessed using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF; Gioia & Isquith, 2004) at 6, 12, and 18 months postinjury. Mixed model analyses, using pre-injury executive functioning (assessed by the BRIEF at baseline) as a covariate, examined the relationship of   and family characteristics to executive functioning in  with moderate and severe TBI compared to OI. Results: Among  with moderate TBI, higher levels of authoritarian  were associated with greater executive difficulties at 12 and 18 months following injury. Permissive and authoritative   were not significantly associated with postinjury executive skills. Finally, fewer family resources predicted more executive deficits across all of the groups, regardless of injury type. Conclusion: These findings provide additional evidence regarding the role of the social and familial environment in emerging behavior problems following hood TBI."
"Marital conflict management skills, parenting style, and early-onset conduct problems: Processes and pathways",1999,"This  examined whether the link between marital conflict management  and  conduct problems with peers and s is direct or mediated by mothers' and fathers'   (critical  and low emotional responsivity). One hundred and twenty , aged 4 to 7 years, were observed interacting in our laboratory playroom solving a problem with their best friend as well as at home with their s. In addition, all the 's s were observed in our laboratory trying to solve two family problems as well as at home interacting under more natural conditions with each other and with their . Mothers and fathers completed questionnaires assessing marital problem solving as well as reports of their 's behavior problems. Results indicated that a negative marital conflict management  had direct links with 's conduct problems. In addition, the linkage between negative marital conflict management and 's interactions with s and peers was found to be mediated by both mothers' and fathers' critical  and low emotional responsivity, thereby supporting the indirect as well as the direct model of negative family interactions. The findings are discussed in relation to the implications for treatment."
Parent- attachment as a mediator of the relationship between parenting style and gelotophobia among adolescents,2019,"Fear of being laughed at and family interaction are highly related. al over-control and over-protection influence 's excessive anxiety over being laughed at. Conversely, al attachment is an important index of the - relationship and is closely correlated to 's gelotophobia. However, is it the  of  or the outcome of  (i.e. attachment) that influences a 's gelotophobia? To answer this question, the   analysed the relationships between gelotophobia, perceived  of  and - attachment, as well as the mediating role of attachment between  and 's gelotophobia, using a sample of 373 high-school students. The  show that being highly communicative and close attachment completely weakened the negative correlation between warm, caring  and the 's gelotophobia; moreover, being highly communicative and close attachment, together with over-protective and over-controlling , influence 's gelotophobia. In sum, this  indicates that - attachment has a direct and indirect influence on perceived al care and protection and 's fear of being laughed at."
Emerging adult psychological problems and parenting style: Moderation by parent- relationship quality,2019,"Current  supports a relationship between   and 's mental health, yet this has been understudied in emerging adults. Moreover, even less  has included the role of - relationship quality on these existing relationships, which has been demonstrated to be an important moderator, Thus, the current  examined the moderating effect of - relationship quality on   and emerging adult internalizing and externalizing problems. It was expected that higher - relationship quality would buffer against negative effects of less adaptive   on emerging adult psychological problems. Participants included 2732 emerging adults attending college who reported on their own psychological problems, perceived  , and - relationship quality for both mothers and fathers. Results indicated that the lowest rates of emerging adult internalizing and externalizing problems were associated with higher - relationship quality in same-sex - dyads within the context of authoritative . Higher quality father-daughter relationship was protective against the negative effects of permissive   as evidenced by lower reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Results emphasize the continuing influence of   and - relationship quality on emerging adult mental health, particularly for daughters."
The health consequences of  mental health problems and parenting styles: Unintentional injuries among European school,2014,"Objective. Unintentional injury is the leading cause of death for school. We assessed the association between externalizing psychopathology,  , and unintentional injury in European  in the community. Methods. Data were drawn from the School Children Mental Health in Europe project and included 4517 school across seven diverse European regions. Past-year injuries serious enough to seek medical attention were reported by mothers. Child mental health problems were assessed using validated measures and reported by the mothers, teachers, and .   were based on The  Scale and the  Behaviors and Attitudes Questionnaire. Results. Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity symptoms and oppositional defiant symptoms had a higher risk of injury compared to other  whether based on  report (OR = 1.47,95% C.I. 12-1.9), teacher report (OR = 136,95% C.I. 1.1-1.7), or  and teacher report combined (OR = 1.53, 95% C.I. 1.1-2.1). Children who self-reported oppositional symptoms  had higher risk of injury (OR = 1.6,95% C.I. 1.1-2.4). Low-caring behavior of s increased the risk of injury (OR = 1.4,95% C.I. 1.1-1.9). Conclusion. Unintentional injury is a potential adverse health consequence of  externalizing problems. Interventions to improve - relationships and prevention as well as focused treatment for externalizing problems may reduce the burden of injury. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"The relationship between maternal parenting style, female adolescent decision making, and contraceptive use",2011,"Purpose: To examine the relationship between maternal  , female adolescent decision making, and contraceptive behavior in multiethnic, 14- to 17-year-old Hawaii residents. Data sources: This was a descriptive cross-sectional survey design using a convenience sample of 112 female adolescents 14-17 years of age who came for health care from four clinics on the island of Maui and the Big Island of Hawaii. Along with a brief demographic questionnaire, maternal   was measured by the al Control Scale, decision making was measured by the Flinders Adolescent Decision Making Questionnaire, and sexual activity and contraception use was measured by a non-normed Sexual History and Contraceptive Use Questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and correlations were used to analyze associations and correlations between age, maternal  , decision self-esteem, decision coping (vigilant and maladaptive), and contraceptive use for sexually active female adolescents. Conclusions: No significant associations or correlations were found between age, maternal  , decision self-esteem, decision coping (vigilant and maladaptive), and contraceptive use. There were significant positive correlations (p < .05) between maternal  , age, and decision coping-complacency, suggesting that maternal   are more controlling and that decision coping-complacency increases as the adolescent ages, leading the adolescents to take a less active role in decision making."
Parenting Style and Adolescent Clinical Severity: Findings From Two Substance Abuse Treatment Studies,2008,"The purpose of this  was to evaluate the association between authoritative, authoritarian, indulgent, and neglectful , and clinical severity of adolescent substance abuse. Data were examined from 2 substance abuse treatment outcome studies: the Cannabis Youth Treatment (CYT)  and Project Iowa SCY. In both studies, authoritative  was associated with less -reported substance problem severity compared to neglectful . In CYT, authoritative  was  associated with lower conduct disorder severity when compared to authoritarian and neglectful . Findings were not replicated with adolescent-reported outcomes. Lower level of care recommendations are made for authoritatively ed youth when compared to those from authoritarian and neglectful homes. Additional  should rule out shared method variance explanations and investigate whether changes in  practices predict substance abuse treatment outcomes."
"Self-Report of Parenting Style, Socio-economic Status and Psychological Functioning in a Community Sample of 13-15-year-old Students",2010,"Data from 391 students aged 13-15 were analysed using bivariate analysis to determine the extent to which student self-report of 'negative'   was associated with psychological functioning, as defined by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) (Goodman, 1997) and with self-report of socio-economic status. Findings: The findings affirm that  who perceive   as negative are more at risk of abnormal psychological functioning as measured by the SDQ, and that perhaps contrary to expectations, the  of those from professional backgrounds may be at greater risk of perceiving  as negative and of poor psychological functioning than those from low income backgrounds. Applications: It is concluded that 'risk' to , while  in negative , is exacerbated by wider factors in the ecological framework such as school, housing, income, and aspirations, and that social work and policy initiatives aimed at  and at low income families are unlikely to be successful in producing well adjusted young people without much greater investment in the wider fabric of their lives."
Predicting dietary intake among  classified as overweight or at risk for overweight: Independent and interactive effects of parenting practices and styles,2017,"Using baseline data from a randomized controlled pediatric obesity prevention trial, this  sought to examine general   as a potential moderator of the association between feeding-specific  practices and  dietary intake. Four hundred and twenty-one - dyads served as participants (49% girls and 93% mothers). Children were, on average, 6.6 years old and either overweight or at-risk for overweight (mean BMI percentile = 84.9). Data were collected in participants' homes. Study staff measured 's height and weight. s completed questionnaires designed to assess general   (authoritative, authoritarian and permissive) and  feeding practices (restriction and monitoring). Child dietary intake was assessed using a 24-h recall system. Outcomes were daily servings of fruits and vegetables, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), and unhealthy snacks. Results were as follows: Permissive  was inversely associated with fruit and vegetable consumption, and al monitoring was inversely associated with SSB consumption. There were no other main effects of   or feeding practice on  dietary consumption. Authoritarian  moderated the association between restriction and SSB intake (a marginally significant effect after correcting for multiple comparisons). Restriction was inversely associated with SSB consumption when authoritarianism was high but unassociated with SSB consumption when authoritarianism was low. Findings indicate that the  practice of monitoring  dietary intake was associated with more healthful consumption regardless of  ; interventions may thus benefit from encouraging al monitoring. The  strategy of restricting  dietary intake, in contrast, was associated with lower SSB intake in the context of higher al authoritarianism but inconsequential in the context of lower al authoritarianism. This exploratory finding warrants further investigation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Chinese American adolescents: perceived parenting styles and adolescents' psychosocial health,2013,"Background Asian Americans are one of the fastest-growing minority groups in the USA, and Chinese constitute the largest group. Evidence suggests that Asian American adolescents experience higher levels of depressive symptoms than their same-gender white counterparts. Quantitative findings suggest associations between  factors and Chinese American adolescents' mental health. A qualitative understanding regarding Chinese American adolescents' perceived   and its relationship with adolescents' psychosocial health is warranted. Aim To gain an in-depth understanding of Chinese American adolescents' perceived   and how   might influence adolescents' psychosocial health. Methods In this qualitative , we recruited 15 Chinese American adolescents aged 1217 years in a southwest metropolitan area. We conducted two focus group interviews. Participants  filled out a brief questionnaire that included their socio-demographic information, immigration history and level of acculturation. Results Participants reported perceiving that s had high expectations about academic performance and moral values. They  perceived stricter family rules regarding choices of friends compared with their non-Asian peers. s tended to be more protective of girls than of boys. Both Chinese American boys and girls reported poor or ineffective communication with their s, which contributed to increased conflict between s and adolescents and emotional distress of the adolescents. Conclusions The findings provide evidence for nurses to develop linguistically and culturally tailored resources (e.g.  support groups, programs aimed to improving  communication) or connect these families with existing resources to enhance  skills and consequently reduce emotional distress of their adolescent ."

Perceived Parenting Styles and Mental Health: The Multiple Mediation Effect of Perfectionism and Altruistic Behavior,2021,"Background: According to the ecological systems theory, the microsystems are important during the development process because they have direct effects on immediate and proximal factors that shape human development. The theory identifies the family as a microsystem that has profound influence on development since it is the immediate environment in which individuals live. This  explored the multiple mediation effect of perfectionism and altruistic behavior on the association between perceived   and mental health. Methods: In this cross-sectional , convenience cluster sampling was used, and the purpose was empirically examined by means of an online questionnaire survey. This  adopted the Demographic Questionnaire, short-form Egna Minnen Betraffande Uppfostran, Chinese Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, Self-Reported Altruism Scale, and General Health Questionnaire to conduct measurements in 525 university students. Results: The  of the correlation analysis revealed that perceived   were significantly correlated to perfectionism, altruistic behavior, and mental health. In addition, perfectionism and altruistic behavior were significantly correlated to mental health, while negative perfectionism was not correlated to altruistic behavior. The  of the structural equation model analysis indicated that al rejection and emotional warmth had direct and significant effects on 's mental health. Positive perfectionism and altruistic behavior not only played partial mediating roles between al emotional warmth and 's mental health but  exerted a chain multiple mediation effect. Altruistic behavior played a partial mediating role between positive perfectionism and mental health. Conclusion: Therefore, s should practice positive   such as al emotional warmth toward their  to ensure that positive perfectionism and altruistic behavioral tendency improve mental health."

Early parenting styles and sexual offending behavior: A comparative study,2016,"Sexual offenders, in general, report problematic rearing practices from their s, lacking however more empirical  on this topic regarding particular subtypes of offenders. The current  examined the relationship between early   and different types of sexual offending. A total of 113 sexual offenders (rapists, pedophilic and nonpedophilic  molesters), and 51 nonsexual offenders completed the EMBU (My Memories of Upbringing), the Brief Symptom Inventory, and the Socially Desirable Response Set Measure. Results showed that rapists were less likely to remember their fathers as being emotionally warm compared with nonsexual offenders and pedophilic  molesters. In addition, compared with rapists, pedophilic offenders perceived their mothers as having been less emotionally warm to them. Overall,  showed that certain developmental experiences with s were able to distinguish between subtypes of offenders supporting an association between distal interpersonal factors and sexual offending. These findings may have important implications for early intervention and prevention of sexual crimes. Further  using larger samples of pedophilic  molesters is recommended. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Autistic mothers' perinatal well-being and parenting styles,,"Autistic people may be at higher risk of perinatal mental health conditions, given that autism and mental health conditions commonly co-occur and that autistic people face additional stressors such as barriers to appropriate maternity care. This  explored self-reported stress, depression, anxiety and satisfaction with life during the third trimester of pregnancy (n = 27 autistic women; n = 25 non-autistic women), 2 to 3 months after birth (n = 24 autistic women; n = 26 non-autistic women) and 6 months after birth (n = 22 autistic women; n = 29 non-autistic women). Self-reported  confidence and   were explored at 6 months after birth. Autistic participants scored significantly higher than non-autistic participants on stress, depression and anxiety across the time-points as a whole, although there were no group differences for satisfaction with life. Anxiety scores significantly decreased over time for both groups. No group differences were found for  confidence nor  anxiety, nurturance, involvement or routine, although the autistic group scored lower on  discipline. The findings highlight the need for effective screening and support for perinatal mental health conditions for autistic people. Professionals working with autistic s should be aware that autistic and non-autistic s report being equally likely to engage in positive  behaviours such as nurturance and involvement. Lay abstract Autistic people can have difficulties during pregnancy and after giving birth, such as difficulty getting health care that meets their needs. Autistic people may therefore have lower well-being than non-autistic people during this time. We asked autistic and non-autistic people to fill in questionnaires measuring stress, depression, anxiety and satisfaction with life. They were asked to do this once during pregnancy, once 2 to 3 months after giving birth and once 6 months after giving birth. At 6 months after giving birth, they  filled in questionnaires about . The autistic s had higher stress, depression and anxiety scores than the non-autistic s. For both groups, scores for anxiety went down over time. There were no differences between the groups on satisfaction with their life or how confident they were as a . There were no differences between the groups on most areas of  , although autistic s scored lower on  discipline. This  suggests that autistic people may be more stressed, depressed and anxious than non-autistic people during pregnancy and after giving birth. Autistic people therefore need good quality support during this time. This   suggests that autistic and non-autistic s may be just as likely to  in positive ways such as being sensitive to their baby's needs."
"Inflexible Parents, Inflexible Kids: A 6-Year Longitudinal Study of Parenting Style and the Development of Psychological Flexibility in Adolescents",2012," behaviors have been linked to 's self regulation, but it is less clear how they relate to adolescent psychological flexibility. Psychological flexibility is a broad construct that describes an individual's ability to respond appropriately to environmental demands and internal experiences in the service of their goals. We examined the longitudinal relationships between perceived   and psychological flexibility among students at five Australian schools (N = 749) over 6 years, beginning in Grade 7 (50.3% female, mean age 12.39 years).   was measured in Grades 7 and 12, and psychological flexibility from Grade 9 through 12. Psychological flexibility decreased, on average, with age. Multi-level modelling indicated that authoritarian  (low warmth, high control) in Grade 7 predicted later (low) psychological flexibility. Moreover, increases in authoritarian  and decreases in authoritative  (high warmth and control) were associated with adolescent psychological flexibility across the high school years. Change in  predicted future psychological flexibility but did not predict change over time. Structural Equation Modelling revealed that adolescent psychological flexibility in Grade 9 predicted later decreases in authoritarian and increases in authoritative . We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding how  changes and the consequences of such change for the development of psychological flexibility."

A total of 1,127 undergraduates were recruited to complete the questionnaires about  , core self-evaluation, career calling, and career decision-making difficulties. The  showed that: (1) Positive and negative   could positively predict career decision-making difficulties in college students. (2) Core self-evaluation and career calling mediated the relationship between   and career decision-making difficulties. Sequential dual mediators only found in which positive paternal and maternal   predict career decision-making difficulties through core self-evaluation and career calling. (3) Further analysis revealed gender difference in the relationship between   and career decision-making difficulties. The relation between paternal positive   and career decision-making difficulties was significant in male students, but absent in female students; the relation between maternal positive  and career decision-making difficulties and the relation between paternal negative  and career calling were significant in female students, but absent in male students; and the relation between career calling and career decision-making difficulties was greater in male than in female.

"An Initial Study on How Families Deal with Ridicule and Being Laughed at: Parenting Styles and Parent-Child Relations with Respect to Gelotophobia, Gelotophilia, and Katagelasticism",2012,"Familial aggregation and the effect of   on three dispositions toward ridicule and being laughed at were tested. Nearly 100 families (s, their adult , and their siblings) completed subjective questionnaires to assess the presence of gelotophobia (the fear of being laughed at), gelotophilia (the joy of being laughed at), and katagelasticism (the joy of laughing at others). A positive relationship between fear of being laughed at in  and their s was found. Results for gelotophilia were similar but numerically lower; if split by gender of the adult , correlations to the mother's gelotophilia exceeded those of the father. Katagelasticism arose independently from the scores in the s but was robustly related to greater katagelasticism in the 's siblings. Gelotophobes remembered punishment (especially from the mother), lower warmth and higher control from their s (this was  found in the s' recollections of their  ). The incidence of gelotophilia was unrelated to specific  , and katagelasticism exhibited only weak relations with punishment. The  suggests a specific pattern in the relation of the three dispositions within families and argues for a strong impact of   on gelotophobia but less so for gelotophilia and katagelasticism."
"Perceived parenting styles, academic achievement, and life satisfaction of college students: the mediating role of motivation orientation",2021,"Using the perspective of self-determination theory, we examined college students' motivation orientation as a mediator of the relationship between   and life satisfaction or GPA. The sample was drawn from a medium size university in the northeast of the USA (N = 432). While controlling for gender, age, and ethnicity, we used structural equation modeling and found that all three motivation types (intrinsic, extrinsic, and amotivation) act as partial mediators of the relationship between authoritative  and life satisfaction, whereas amotivation acts as a partial mediator of the relationship between authoritarian  and life satisfaction. Although we did not find support that motivation types act as mediators between perceived   and GPA, we did find that the external and the introjected motivations, as well as the intrinsic motivation to know significantly and negatively correlate with GPA, whereas the identified extrinsic motivation and the intrinsic motivation to accomplish significantly and positively correlate with GPA. Our  imply that both perceived   and motivation types are important and inter-related factors for the wellbeing and performance of college students."

Do perceived parenting styles influence stress coping in patients with major depressive disorders?,1999,"  can influence an individual's ability to cope with stress; consequently, coping strategies may moderate the interaction between stress and psychiatric disorders. The correlation between perceived   and stress-coping strategies in 50 outpatients in remission from major depressive disorders was investigated. Using multiple regression analysis including symptoms, gender and age of subjects as independent variables, maternal care and male gender were significant variables for predicting task-oriented coping strategies (p < 0.05). Low maternal care and highly overprotective  were significant variables for predicting emotion-oriented coping strategies (p ( 0.05). These findings suggest that perceived   of the mother experienced in hood may be related to stress-coping  in adulthood. It should nevertheless be considered whether s' actual rearing methods affect their offspring's ability to cope with stress or whether an individual who retrospectively perceives a lack of al affection tends to use more emotion-oriented coping and less task-oriented coping.

"Subjective well-being, parent-adolescent relationship, and perceived parenting style among Israeli adolescents involved in a gap-year volunteering service",2019,"Introduction: In the past few decades, many older Israeli adolescents have postponed mandatory service in the Israeli Defense Forces to volunteer for a year of civil service during the gap year after high school. They meet, for the first time, the complexity of Israeli society, ethnic diversity, social disparity, and other painful aspects of human life. To date there is no  on the subjective well-being (SWB) of these adolescents, and specifically with regard to the  characteristics that contribute to their SWB. Objective: The   aims to explore the contribution of   and -adolescent relationship to the well-being of these adolescents. Participants: One hundred ninety-eight Jewish Israeli adolescents participating in 1-year gap-year programs, recruited via email through their program coordinators. Methods: We collected demographic information and information on   (al Authority Questionnaire [PAQ]; Buri, J. R. 1991. al Authority Questionnaire. Journal of Personality Assessment 57 (1): 110-119), adolescent SWB (Personal Wellbeing Index [PWI-A]: International Wellbeing Group. 2006. Personal Wellbeing Index. 5th ed. Melbourne, Australia: Australian Centre on Quality of Life, Deakin University), and perceived -adolescent relationship (al Attachment Scale [PAS]; Chapple, C. L. 2006. al Attachment Scale (PAS). In Measures for Clinical Practice and Research: A Sourcebook: Vol. 1. Couples, Families, and Children, edited by K. Corcoran, and J. Fischer, 388-389. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press). Results: Adolescent SWB was positively correlated with -adolescent relationship and authoritative  . Moreover, -adolescent relationship partially mediated the relationship between authoritative   and SWB and between authoritarian   and SWB. Conclusion: Results demonstrate the crucial role of the - relationship in linking   and adolescent SWB during the gap-year period."
"Parenting Style, Locus of Control and Self-efficacy: A Correlational Study",2009,"The   examined the relationship between   (authoritative, authoritarian or permissive), locus of control, and generalized self-efficacy (GSE) among senior school students. Three questionnaires were used, namely, the al Authority Questionnaire (PAQ), the Multidimensional-Multi-attribution Causality Scale (MMCS - including only the achievement subscale), and Generalized Self-efficacy Scale (GSE). The  of stepwise linear multiple regression, treating GSE as the dependent variable, revealed many unexpected findings. Contrary to expectations, overall   and locus of control were relatively weak predictors of GSE, although many of the bivariate correlations were significant in the expected direction. Authoritative  and effort explained more variance than other variables. As hypothesized, significant positive correlations were found between (1) authoritative  and GSE, (2) total internality (combining ability and effort, as well as success and failure) and GSE, (3) permissive  and total externality (combining success and failure), and (4) authoritarian  and total externality (combining success and failure). Other significant correlations were  found between some   and some components of locus of control. Findings were interpreted in terms of the specific links between the core components of the three variables, such as al supportiveness or punitiveness, contingent success, and efficacy expectancy."
Do the Associations of Parenting Styles With Behavior Problems and Academic Achievement Vary by Culture? Results From a Meta-Analysis,2018,"Objective: The  tested whether associations of   with internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and academic achievement vary between ethnic groups in western countries, between different regions of the globe, and by level of collectivism/individualism of individual countries. Method: A systematic search in electronic databases and cross referencing identified 428 studies that were included in the random-effects meta-analysis. Results: More ethnic and regional similarities than differences were identified. In western countries, associations of authoritative  with academic achievement were stronger in non-Hispanic, White families than in Asian minorities. In these countries, associations of authoritarian  with academic achievement were less negative in Hispanic families than in non-Hispanic, White families. Authoritative  was associated with at least 1 positive  outcome and authoritarian  was associated with at least 1 negative outcome in all regions of the globe, with some regional variation. Finally, associations of authoritarian  with  outcomes were weaker in countries with a higher individualism score, as were associations of authoritative  with academic performance. Conclusions: s across the globe could be recommended to behave authoritatively, although authoritarian and permissive  is, to some extent, tolerable in a few cultural contexts."
"Beliefs about parental authority, parenting styles, and parent-adolescent conflict among Iranian mothers of middle adolescents",2011,"Associations among  , al authority beliefs, and adolescent- conflict were examined in 426 mothers of middle adolescents from 3 cities in Iran. Consistent with past , mothers judged al authority as less legitimate for personal than for conventional or prudential issues. Poorer, less educated mothers were more authoritarian in their , and more authoritarian and less authoritative  and poorer maternal mental health were uniquely associated with more frequent and more intense conflicts. Conflicts were more frequent among mothers who evaluated al authority as less legitimate for prudential issues and more legitimate for personal issues, particularly among mothers of boys. Despite broad variation in mothers' education and social class, conflicts reflected concerns about drawing boundaries between mothers' legitimate authority and adolescents' personal jurisdiction."
Family Management Style as a Mediator between Parenting Stress and Quality of Life of Children with Epilepsy,2019,"Purpose: To examine the possible relationship between  stress and quality of life of  with epilepsy together with the mediating effects of family management  on this relationship. Design and methods: We conducted a descriptive and exploratory  using data of participants were 93 s with an epileptic . Instruments were self-reported questionnaires including the Korean version of the Quality of Life (QOL) in Childhood Epilepsy Questionnaire (K-QOLCE), the Korean version of the  Stress Index (PSI), and the Korean version of the Family Management Measure (FaMM). Six domains of FaMM were clustered into two domains: easy or difficult family management . Descriptive and Pearson correlation path analyses were used to analyze the data. Results: The direct effects of PSI on QOL were not significant (b = -0.21, t = -0.94, p = .349). Indirect effects of PSI through easy family management  on QOL were significant (b = -0.33, 95% CI = [-0.77, -0.05]). Additionally, two other effects (i.e., indirect effects through difficult family management  and direct effects) were non-significant. All effects of PSI on QOL were fully mediated through easy family management . Conclusion: Easy family management  are the most important factor in predicting QOL in hood epilepsy patients. Practice implications: Comprehensive intervention programs are recommended for s and families of epileptic  to promote positive perceptions of the 's life and to increase al management ability of the 's condition and al mutuality.

The Association Between Internet Parenting Styles and Children's Use of the Internet at Home,2014,"  are known to have a powerful influence on  development, and as such they can significantly influence 's Internet use. The purpose of this  is to examine the Internet   of Jordanian s and their perspectives on their 's Internet use. Children's Internet use was evaluated in terms of four distinct  : authoritarian, authoritative, permissive, and neglectful. A total of 570 Jordanian s of K-2  participated in this . For the purpose of the , the ers developed two scales: Internet  Style Scale and Internet Usage Scale. Results indicated that the authoritative Internet   was the most commonly used   practiced by Jordanian s, followed by the permissive and authoritarian  , with the neglectful   being used the least. According to the s, their 's Internet use typically involved playing games online and visiting websites. The findings  revealed that only the authoritarian   was a significant predictor of 's Internet use. Implications of these findings for s and  are considered."
Parenting styles and adolescents' achievement strategies,2000,"The aim of the  was to investigate the extent to which adolescents' achievement strategies are associated with the   they experience in their families. Three hundred and ftfty-four 14-year-old adolescents completed a Strategy and Attribution Questionnaire and a family   inventory. Analogous questionnaires were  completed by the adolescents' s. Based on adolescents' report of the  , four types of families were identified: those with Authoritative, Authoritarian, Permissive, and Neglectful  . The  further showed that adolescents from authoritative families applied most adaptive achievement strategies characterized by low levels of failure expectations, task-irrelevant behaviour and passivity, and the use of self-enhancing attributions. Adolescents from neglectful families, in turn, applied maladaptive strategies characterized by high levels of task-irrelevant behaviour, passivity and a lack of self-enhancing attributions. The  provide a basis for understanding some of the processes by which   may influence adolescents' academic achievement and performance.

Does parenting behaviour impacts delinquency? A comparative study of delinquents and nondelinquents,2010,"The   examines the relationship between mothers' and fathers'  behaviour and the development of delinquency in male adolescents located in Kolkata, India. The data were collected from 200 adolescents (100 delinquents and 100 non-delinquents) aged 11-18 years. A significant difference exists in the  dimensions of the two groups of adolescents. Further analysis revealed that   of mothers and fathers were linked to delinquency, of which authoritative  appeared to be the best  of . On the other hand, neglectful and authoritarian  was positively related to delinquency. Furthermore, the impact of age and religion upon delinquency was  studied. Age of the delinquent was related to delinquency and it was noted that early adolescence was a richer breeding ground of delinquency. No impact was found between religion and delinquency. The findings have implications for  and its effort in reducing delinquency in India."
Mothers' Parenting Styles and the Association with Family Coping Strategies and Family Adaptation in Families of Children with ADHD,2015,"The aim of this  was to determine how the   of mothers are associated with the coping strategies and adaptability of families with a  diagnosed with ADHD. Using a cross-sectional  design, data was collected from mothers reing 98 South African families with  diagnosed with ADHD. Significant positive correlations were found between dimensions of the mothers' authoritative   (connection, autonomy granting and regulation) and the re-evaluation and mobilization of family coping strategies. A regression analysis indicated medication, mothers' connection and mothers' regulation as the best predictor variables for family adaptation. The use of medication to help control core ADHD symptoms can benefit families. In order to improve outcomes for s and  with ADHD, it is  recommended that mothers are taught authoritative  skills."
"Parenting styles and perceived instrumentality of schooling in native, Turkish, and Vietnamese families in Germany",2015,"The paper investigates empirically the perceived instrumentality and social costs of schooling, and culture-specific   in three ethnic groups in Germany. It uses a standardized cross-sectional  with mothers and their  in a 2 x 3 x 4 design: In two receiving contexts (Hamburg and Saxony) with three ethnic groups (families of Turkish, Vietnamese and German origin) and four age groups of  (transition to Kindergarten, to primary school, to lower, and higher secondary school), data were collected from 1523 mother--dyads. Cultural differences in   were identified in the tradition of Baumrind (1978). While an indulgent  (high on emotional involvement EI, low on al control PC) was predominant for the German mothers (43 %), it was neglectful (low on EI and PC) for the Turkish mothers (30 %) and authoritarian (low on EI and high on PC) for the Vietnamese (54 %). Both migrant groups perceive a higher instrumentality of schooling than native mothers, but perceive  higher social costs, such as alienation in the - relationship. Multivariate analyses reveal that these ethnic differences remain significant, when cultural and social capital, occupational and migration status and acculturation are controlled."
"Potential Use of Food/Activity, Parenting Style, and Caregiver Feeding Style Measurement Tools with American Indian Families: A Brief Report",2017,"Objective To provide preliminary descriptive data on caregiver and  weight status,  , feeding , and feeding practices of a small American Indian sample. Methods Participants included a subsample of American Indian caregivers (n = 23) identified from a larger  that was conducted in five states. Using previously validated instruments, means, standard deviations, and ranges for general  , feeding , and feeding practices were explored. Results In general, most caregivers reported healthy feeding practices. Most caregivers scored higher on responsive compared to restrictive or permissive in general . Of the sample, 12 caregivers (52.2 %) were classified in the indulgent feeding  category, 5 caregivers (21.7 %) were classified as authoritative, 5 (21.7 %) uninvolved, and 1 (4.3 %) authoritarian. Conclusions More investigations are needed to explore questions raised by this  about using common tools that measure hood obesity with American Indian families."

"The Associations between Perceived Parenting Styles, Empathy, and Altruistic Choices in Economic Games: A Study of Chinese Children",2017,"  are critical for fostering 's empathy and prosociality. Yet these relations haven't been well established for Chinese , and the underlying mechanisms were seldom explored. Drawing upon al acceptance-rejection theory and empathy-altruism hypothesis, the objective of this  was to investigate the relationships between perceived   and altruistic behavior of , and the intervening role of 's empathy and the moderating role of in-group and out-group conditions. What is novel about this  is that it contains both survey data and experimental data. Four hundred and ninety-four  (M-age = 8.92 years) completed four simple binary-choice dictator games which are widely used in the  of other-regarding preferences (concerns for the interests of others). These   reported their perceived  . And 's empathy was reported by their mothers. Each 's altruism score, which was used in the subsequent analyses, was derived from the altruistic choices in these games. Mediation analyses indicated that, when age and gender were controlled for, maternal and paternal emotional warmth were positively associated with 's altruism via 's empathy, while maternal and paternal rejection were negatively associated with 's altruism via 's empathy. Multi-group analyses showed that the influences of perceived   on 's altruistic behavior via 's empathy were consistent for in-group and out-group conditions. These findings suggest that enhancing al emotional warmth and reducing al rejection may foster 's empathy, which in turn promote 's altruism. Limitations and future directions of this  were  discussed."
Are parental autism spectrum disorder and/or attention-deficit/Hyperactivity disorder symptoms related to parenting styles in families with ASD ( plus ADHD) affected ?,2013,"An understudied and sensitive topic nowadays is that even subthreshold symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/Hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in s may relate to their  . The aim of this  was to explore the influence of (the combined) effect of  diagnosis (ASD or ASD + ADHD affected/unaffected ) and al ASD and/or ADHD on  . Ninety-six families were recruited with one  with a clinical ASD (+ADHD) diagnosis, and one unaffected sibling. al ASD and ADHD symptoms were assessed using self-report. The  Styles Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ) self- and spouse-report were used to measure the authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive  . Fathers and mothers scored significantly higher than the norm data of the PSDQ on the permissive  regarding affected , and lower on the authoritative and authoritarian   for affected and unaffected . Self- and spouse-report correlated modestly too strongly. Higher levels of paternal (not maternal) ADHD symptoms were suboptimally related to the three  . Further, two - pathology interaction effects were found, indicating that fathers with high ADHD symptoms and mothers with high ASD symptoms reported to use a more permissive   only towards their unaffected .

How do relationships support parenting? Effects of attachment style and social support on parenting behavior in an at-risk population,2007,"The importance of supportive relationships for new s has been the focus of both  and  interventions. Attachment , typically viewed as a relatively stable trait reflecting one's comfort in social relationships, as well as social support, or one's perception of the social context, have both been found to be important for fostering engaged, involved . Less is known, however, about how these variables work together to influence  behavior, especially in families at higher risk for negative  outcomes. Data were collected from 152 urban, predominantly African American, low-income s when their  were 14 and 36 months of age. Results suggest that s with more social support show greater increases in the frequency of positive - activities over time, but that this effect is mediated by mothers' attachment , specifically, their level of anxious/ambivalent attachment. Mothers with more social support tended to be less anxious/ambivalent about close relationships, and this in turn led to increases over time in the frequency of - interactions. Mothers' tendency to avoid close relationships, however, while correlated with social support, was unrelated to changes in  behavior. Implications of these findings for program development, , and the malleability of attachment  based on social context are discussed."
"Locus of control, perceived parenting style, and anxiety in  with cerebral palsy",2008,"In this  we examined interrelations among locus of control (LOC), disease severity, anxiety, and   (PS) in  with cerebral palsy (CP). Thirty  with CP and their 30 healthy siblings completed self-report measures of LOC, anxiety, and perceived PS of the mother. A neurological assessment determined severity of CP. Children with CP, regardless of severity, did not differ from their siblings in LOC, anxiety, or perceived PS. Multiple-regression analyses showed that LOC was predicted only by the acceptance/rejection dimension of PS in  with CP; whereas for their siblings, age, and anxiety were the best predictors. The findings suggest a central influence of the home environment on 's psychological development. For  with CP, experiencing al acceptance may enhance development of resilience-related qualities, such as an internal LOC."
Considering parenting styles in the motivational factors for choosing to become a kindergarten teacher,2018,"Background: The literature on pre-service education indicates that the choice to become a teacher is dependent on a number of factors: extrinsic, intrinsic, altruistic and outside influences, such as family, peers, teachers and others. This  tested the perceived influence of these variables among pre-service kindergarten teachers, while specifically investigating the differential influence of the student's  as a function of his / her  . Method: Data were collected from 141 pre-service kindergarten teacher students from teacher-trainee academic college in Northern Israel. All participants were females whose age ranges from 19 to 46 (M = 26.88, SD=5.84). Results: The rating of the factors for choosing teaching as a profession among the students in descending order was: 1. Bonding with  2. Educational impact 3. Professional motives 4. Socioeconomic security and exploiting the personal experience 5. Agents of influence (School and s). As for the al effect, it was found that kindergarten teacher trainees who perceived their s as authoritative ascribed them as having a greater influence on their professional preferences than those who perceived their s as non-authoritative. The authoritative group  considered their s as being more influential than their educators. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that al influence on descendants' teaching preferences should be considered in context of authoritative  which magnify the al significance."
Perceived parenting behaviours predict young adolescents' nutritional intake and body fatness,2008,"This  investigated whether perceptions of  behaviours predict young adolescents' nutritional intake and body fatness. The randomly selected  sample consisted of 106 13-15 years olds from Houston Metropolitan Statistical Area.   variables were created by cluster analysis and factor analysis. A two-cluster solution for both maternal and paternal   reed authoritative vs. non-authoritative . Two  dimension factors derived were maternal/paternal nurturing and control. For adolescents' energy and nutrient intake, greater maternal nurturing appeared to be most beneficial given its association with lower consumption of total kilocalorie and lower saturated fat intake. Paternal nurturing was associated with lower sodium intake, whereas paternal control predicted lower percentage of kilocalories from carbohydrate and percentage Dietary Reference Intake for dietary fibre, and greater percentage of kilocalories from total fat. Maternal authoritative  and lower maternal control over their adolescents may have protective effects against having heavier and fatter adolescents given their associations with adolescents' body weight, sub-scapular skinfold, waist circumference, body mass index, and the tendencies of being at risk of overweight and being overweight. None of paternal   or dimensions appeared to be significantly related to adolescents' body fatness."
"A Proposed Model to Explain Happiness in College Students: The Roles of Perceived Parenting Styles, Emotional Self-Efficacy, and Forgiveness",2021,"This  aimed to explore the effects of perceived   (e.g., mother and father involvement, mother and father strict control) on the happiness of college students. The   investigated the mediating roles of emotional self-efficacy and forgiveness (i.e., forgiveness of self, others, and situations) in this relationship. The form consisting of 123 survey items was voluntarily filled out by 386 college students. A path analysis was carried out in the . Some of the core findings are as follows. Mother and father involvement had positive direct effects on happiness. In addition, both mother and father involvement indirectly affected happiness via emotional self-efficacy. Increase in al involvement led to an increase in emotional self-efficacy, and high emotional self-efficacy contributed to higher happiness. Regarding strict control, neither mothers' nor fathers'  had significant direct or indirect effect on happiness. Improvements in forgiveness of self were related to the gender of the s. On the other hand, improvements in forgiveness of others and situations were related to the type of  . Forgiveness of self was only affected by maternal behaviors. Forgiveness of others was affected by mother and father involvement, while forgiveness of situations was affected by mother and father strict control. However, none of the dimensions of forgiveness had a mediating role in the impact of   on happiness among college students."
Correlates of parenting styles in predominantly working- and middle-class African American mothers,1999,"We examined reported  and disciplinary practices in 114 working and middle class African American mothers of  aged 5-12 rising the  Dimensions Inventory (PDI; Power, 1991), Results indicated substantive variation among s in their disciplinary strategies. Reasoning, which is characteristic of authoritative , was the most frequently reported strategy. Factor analyses were conducted on mother's responses to PDI items, and sociodemographic and psychological variables were related to the identified factors. Maternal education, socioeconomic status, rearing history, and maternal depression differentially predicted -centered , reasoning, and mothers' tendencies to let a situation go. The importance of extending theoretical and empirical models of  determinants to underreed segments of African American families is emphasized in order to gain a fuller understanding of the factors that contribute to diverse  of  in such groups."
Maternal and Paternal Attachment Style and Chaos as Risk Factors for Parenting Behavior,2020,"Objective and Background Household chaos and insecure al attachment  are associated with lower quality  behaviors. However, there is a paucity of evidence regarding fathers'  behaviors, and no studies examine whether chaotic home environments moderate the attachment - behavior relationship. Method Using data from both mothers and fathers of 742  (40.5% African American) living in rural, low-resource communities, the current  examined the individual and joint effects of self-reported adult attachment  and two domains of household chaos on observed maternal and paternal  behaviors during structured play with their 58-month-old  (49.6% female). Results Multivariate models revealed that even after controlling for confounders, attachment insecurity predicted lower quality  behavior for mothers and fathers. Further, for both mothers and fathers, the disorganized domain of household chaos, reing environments high in noise, clutter, and disorder, predicted less sensitive and more intrusive  behavior. Finally, for mothers with dismissive attachment , high levels of disorganization appeared to exacerbate caregiving difficulties; this moderating relationship was not evident for fathers. Conclusion These findings suggest that the stress of a chronically disorganized family environment may influence the expression of mothers' insecure tendencies in the context of , thereby intensifying less sensitive and more intrusive  behaviors. Implications These findings suggest that the stress of a chronically disorganized family environment may impact the expression of mothers' insecure tendencies in the context of , thereby intensifying less sensitive and more intrusive  behaviors."

Antecedents of Looming Cognitive Style: Associations With Reported Perceived Parenting and Attachment,2019,"Looming Cognitive Style, which was proposed as cognitive vulnerability model specific for anxiety disorders, suggests that anxiety-prone individuals have a tendency to perceive threats and dangers as getting closer, becoming larger, and more agonizing every passing minute. Yet, very few studies focused on the family-related variables that are associated with development of Looming Cognitive Style. This  aims to investigate the relationship of Looming Cognitive Style with measures perceived  and attachment. A cross-sectional  was conducted with 389 university students aged between 18 and 35 as participants. The participants were assessed through Looming Cognitive Style, perceived , attachment anxiety, and avoidance. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated Looming Cognitive Style to be significantly predicted by maternal overprotection and anxiety dimension of attachment. The  are important in understanding how -related variables are related to development of cognitive vulnerabilities specific to anxiety disorders."
Demystifying Sexting: Adolescent Sexting and its Associations With Parenting Styles and Sense of Parental Social Control in Israel,2020,"The   examined sexting habits (sending text messages, as well as nude or semi-nude photos, and/or requesting the same from others) among adolescents, as reported by 458 students (101 boys, 357 girls), with the aim of investigating whether and how sexting correlates with   and manifestations of al social control. An online link was published on social media, asking participants who meet the  criteria to complete several questionnaires. About 30% of the participants reported sending sexual messages, and almost 32% reported that others, mainly strangers, asked them to send nude or semi-nude photos. Furthermore, sexting was more common among high-school students than among middle-school students, and asking another person to send nude or semi-nude photos was more common among boys than among girls. Lower al social control was related to increased likelihood of sexting, and higher perception of permissive   was associated with asking someone else to send nude or semi-nude photos. These findings shed light on sexting among adolescents in Israel. Moreover, the findings show that adolescents do not report sexting either to s or to other significant adults in their lives, such as teachers or other educational staff at school. The article concludes with implications for educators and educational counselors in view of these findings."

Participants were 347 Albanian young adults (144 males and 203 females) aged 18 to 28 years. They completed the al Authority Questionnaire and the Adolescent Alcohol and Drug Involvement Scale. Gender, perceived authoritative maternal , and age predicted a proportion of substance use involvement. Gender and perceived authoritative maternal   predicted the proportion of young people at risk for substance use or abuse. Implications of the findings and limitations of the  are discussed."
Authoritative Maternal Parenting Associates With the Explicit Need for Autonomy,2020,"Previous  suggests that   influences the development of the needs for achievement, power, and affiliation. The   investigated the relationship between   and another important motive disposition - the need for autonomy - in a sample of Singapore university students (N = 97, 69% female), using a cross-sectional and retrospective design. It was predicted that an authoritative perceived   would relate positively to the implicit need for autonomy (nAut), the explicit need for autonomy (sanAut), and the congruence between these two motive dispositions. Authoritative maternal  was found to positively associate with sanAut, while maternal  was not found to associate with nAut, or with nAut/sanAut congruence. Paternal  was not associated with any of the dependent variables."
"Parents' Executive Functions, Parenting Styles, and Oppositional Defiant Disorder Symptoms: A Relational Model",2018,"The   examined the role of mother's and father's executive functions (EF), warmth and harsh , and  oppositional defiant disorder symptoms (ODD). A total of 100 families with preschool  participated. The mothers answered three questionnaires: EMBU, ECI-4, and the BRIEF; the fathers answered only the BRIEF. The analysis was done by testing two structural equation models (SEM). The  showed that both models had an excellent fit and ed a significant path from mother's EF toward harsh ; the second model ed a significant path from harsh  to ODD symptoms. Our findings are concluded in light of the importance of addressing  interventions to prevent further conduct/disruptive disorders."
"Intersectionality between parenting styles, area of residence and gender on food group consumption among Costa Rican adolescents",2021,"Little is known about how   can influence the adolescent's consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), fruits and vegetables (FV) and beans in Latin America. This  uses hierarchical moderated regression models to examine such association by area of residence, sex of the  and of the adolescent in Costa Rica. Results showed that fathers' authoritarian  was significantly associated with lower intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) among boys (b =-0.163, p = 0.050), but not girls (b = 0.097, p = 0.114) while mother's authoritarian  was associated with lower SSB intake among girls (b =-0.138, p = 0.031), but not boys (b = 0.159, p = 0.059). Fathers' authoritative  was associated with higher consumption of fruits and vegetables (FV) among boys in rural areas (b=0.440, p= 0.017), but this association was not significant for girls (b=-0.033, p= 0.800) in rural areas or for either gender in urban areas.   of the mothers' and fathers' were not significantly associated with Costa Rican adolescent bean consumption, in general or for any of the subgroups. Findings suggest an intersectionality in the effects of  interactions by  and  sex, cultural and geographic context, and the eating behaviors examined."
"Adult attachment styles: Relations with emotional well-being, marriage, and parenting",1998,"The current  examined the pairings of adult attachment  among married couples raising young . Spouses in dual-secure marriages reported more love for their partner; less ambivalence about their relationships, were more integrated into their social networks, and felt more competent as s than couples in dual-insecure marriages. Differences in relationship dynamics were found in secure husband-avoidant wife and secure wife-avoidant husband marriages. There was no relation between adult attachment ,  behavior and the security of infant- attachments. Future work would benefit by focusing on the dyadic constellations of adult attachment  and their implications for family relationships."
Moderation of associations between maternal parenting styles and Australian pre-school 's dietary intake by family structure and mother's employment status,2019,"Objective To examine associations between maternal   and pre-school 's dietary intake and to test whether perceived maternal time pressures,  arrangements and employment status influence these relationships. Design This cross-sectional  examined mothers' reports of their 's frequency of consumption of eight food and drink groups, including sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), unhealthy snacks, takeaway foods, fruit and vegetables.   were classified as authoritative, authoritarian, permissive or disengaged using two  dimensions (warmth and control). The moderating roles of  arrangements, indexed by number of s in the home and maternal employment status, were assessed. Associations were examined using multinomial regression. Setting Data were from the infant and  cohorts in the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. Participants Children aged 4-5 years from both cohorts (infant: n 3607; : n 4661) were included. Results Compared with  of disengaged mothers,  of authoritative mothers consumed most unhealthy foods less frequently, and fruit and vegetables more frequently. Results suggested  arrangements and mothers' working status may moderate associations between   and SSB, takeaway foods, takeaway snacks and fruit consumption. Conclusions These findings suggest that authoritative   is associated with a higher consumption of fruit and vegetables and a lower consumption of unhealthy foods among . However,  arrangements and the mothers' working status may influence these relationships. Further  is required to examine the influence of other potential moderators of  /food consumption relationships such as household time and resource limitations."
Parenting Styles and Psychological Correlates in a Sample of Egyptian Adolescents With Substance-use Disorders,2016,"Objectives: To    and psychological correlates among a group of Egyptian adolescents with substance-use disorder. Materials and Methods: A case-control  conducted at the Adolescents' substance abuse outpatient clinic, Helwan Psychiatric Hospital. The case group of 81 male adolescents, age range 12 to 18 years, with substance-use disorders matched with the control group of 80 volunteer male adolescents who had never used drugs. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents, the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, the Junior Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, and the Questionnaire of al Attitudes as Realized by Adolescents were applied on members of both groups. Results: The case group had a higher positive family history of psychiatric illness and drug abuse (P = 0.006, < 0.001). Mothers of patients in the case group showed higher independent  (P = 0.039) and consistency (P = 0.02), whereas their fathers showed significant rejection (P < 0.001). Cases had higher psychoticism and neuroticism (P < 0.001, 0.001). Significantly more patients in the case group met the criteria of major depression, and conduct, oppositional defiant, psychotic, and mood disorders with psychotic features. Also, there was a significantly higher suicidality risk (P < 0.001) among patients in the case group. Conclusions: Adolescents with substance-use disorder had a more significant family history of psychiatric illness and substance abuse. Their mothers unexpectedly adopted a more consistent and independent al , whereas fathers were more rejecting and had an overall negative al . Adolescents in the case group had significantly higher psychoticism and neuroticism. Moreover, they met the criteria of major depressive disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, lifetime psychotic disorders, and mood disorder with psychotic features significantly more than the adolescents in the control group."
Self- and Co-regulation of Anger and Fear in Preschoolers with Autism Spectrum Disorders: The Role of Maternal Parenting Style and Temperament,2015,"Emotion regulation (ER) difficulties are a major concern in  with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Maternal temperament and   have significant effects on 's ER. However, these effects have not been studied in  with ASD. Forty preschoolers with ASD and their mothers and forty matched controls engaged in fear and anger ER paradigms, micro-coded for  self- and co-regulatory behaviors and 's regulation-facilitation. Mothers'   and temperament were self-reported. In the ASD group only, maternal authoritarian  predicted higher self-regulation and lower co-regulation of anger and maternal authoritative  predicted higher self-regulation of fear. Maternal temperament did not predict 's ER. Findings emphasize the importance of maternal flexible   in facilitating ER among  with ASD."
"The effects of maternal parenting style and religious commitment on self-regulation, academic achievement, and risk behavior among African-American parochial college students",2009,"This  explored relations between religiosity, both  and Student, and maternal   and student academic: self-regulation, academic achievement, and risk behavior among African-American youth attending a parochial college. Eighty-five students completed self-report survey measures or religiosity, self-regulation, academic achievement, and risk behavior. Participants  completed youth report Measures of al religiosity and perceived maternal  . Correlational analyses show authoritative  to be associated with high levels of academic performance and  skills. Additional correlations revealed that highly religious Students tend to perform well academically,  better, and engage in fewer risk behaviors than Youth less committed to religion. Although no direct relations were observed between   and student religiosity, maternal   was found to moderate relations between al and student religiosity. Findings are discussed In terms of their relevance to the population studied. (C) 2008 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Maternal Socialization Goals, Parenting Styles, and Social-Emotional Adjustment Among Chinese and European American Young Adults: Testing a Mediation Model",2010,"The authors compared the associations among perceived maternal socialization goals (self-development, filial piety, and collectivism), perceived maternal   (authoritative, authoritarian, and training), and the social-emotional adjustment (self-esteem, academic self-efficacy, and depression) between Chinese and European American young adults. The mediation processes in which socialization goals relate to young adults' adjustment outcomes through   were examined. Results showed that European American participants perceived higher maternal self-development socialization goals, whereas Chinese participants perceived higher maternal collectivism socialization goals as well as more authoritarian . Cross-cultural similarities were found in the associations between perceived maternal authoritative  and socioemotional adjustment (e.g., higher self-esteem and higher academic self-efficacy) across the two cultural groups. However, perceived maternal authoritarian and training   were found only to be related to Chinese participants' adjustment (e.g., higher academic self-efficacy and lower depression). The mediation analyses showed that authoritative  significantly mediated the positive associations between the self-development and collectivism goal and socioemotional adjustment for both cultural groups. Additionally, training  significantly mediated the positive association between the filial piety goal and young adults' academic self-efficacy for the Chinese group only. Findings of this  highlight the importance of examining al socialization goals in cross-cultural  ."
Parenting behavior and psychosocial development in elementary school ,2007,"Differential relationships between seven   (inconsistent discipline, positive , involvement, poor monitoring/supervision, power and coercion, responsibility oriented , and corporal punishment) and four types of 's psychosocial behaviors (social-emotional competencies, oppositional-aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, emotional instability-internalizing) are studied cross-sectionally. In a  with 373 s of elementary school  attending first and second grades, s rated their own  behavior with an extended German version of the Alabama  Questionnaire (APQ). In addition, s assessed the psychosocial behavior of their  on a  social behavior checklist (VBV short version). Data were analyzed separately for fathers and mothers. As expected, positive  was closely related to psychosocially competent behavior of . Specifically, mothers' monitoring and fathers' refusal of corporal punishment and of inconsistent discipline added significantly to the prediction of 's social competence. Less positive   were positively related to 's behavioral problems, and negatively related to 's social competencies. Specifically, oppositional-aggressive behaviors of  were positively related to inconsistent discipline and corporal punishment by both s, as well as to responsibility oriented   of mothers and to reports of power and coercion by fathers. Hyperactive behaviors in  were related to inconsistent  by both s, and additionally related to corporal punishment by mothers and the refusal of positive  behaviors in fathers. Internalizing behaviors of  were associated with inconsistent  by both s, and with reports of power and. coercion in fathers. There were no significant interactions between  ."

Based on the , we assert that when planning an intervention to reduce 's PIU for working mothers, a multifaceted approach is essential, including both WFC and  behavior."
Confirmatory Factor Analysis of the Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ) in a Sample of Korean Immigrant Parents in New Zealand,2020,"The  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ) is a widely used 26-item self-report measure based on Baumrind's conceptualizations of authoritarian and authoritative  . Despite its widespread application in   across the globe, concerns have been expressed regarding the applicability of this measure in Asian immigrant samples. Furthermore, no studies have been conducted with Korean immigrant samples, with separate reporting for mothers and fathers, to provide data on the validity and reliability of the PSDQ. The purpose of current  was to conduct confirmatory factor analysis, based on pre-existing models, to evaluate the reliability of the PSDQ in use in Korean immigrant samples and to refine and revise them if necessary. A sample of 207 Korean immigrant s of  (ages 6-10) in New Zealand completed the PSDQ. The  suggest that the revised models largely replicate the existing models, and most of the items that make up the authoritarian and authoritative scales were found to be sufficiently coherent and robust to be used."
Relationship between Parenting Style and Anxiety in a Spanish Children Sample,2019,"The aim of this  is to ascertain whether there are any differences in the  practices experienced by two groups of  with, respectively, low-risk and high-risk scores for anxiety. A second objective is to determine which  variables are linked with the presence or absence of this kind of internalizing problem. From a sample of 550 subjects, we selected 180  between 3 and 12 years of age who met a set of specific criteria as having either high risk scores (90 ) or low risk scores (90 ) for anxiety, according to the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC). After applying the -Child Relationship Inventory (PCRI-M) to both s, we carried out a binomial logistic regression analysis which ed in a prediction model for 83.9% of the sample. The model was based on the following  variables: paternal involvement and support for autonomy, and maternal al support, satisfaction with , involvement, limit setting and role orientation. The paper  discusses the usefulness of our  for the planning of family intervention strategies. The information obtained has broad applications for interventions with families with anxious , since s' responses to the instruments used revealed patterns of behaviour that can be modified in both s and ."
"College drinking behaviors: Mediational links between parenting styles, parental bonds, depression, and alcohol problems",2007,"Mediational links between   (authoritative, authoritarian, permissive), al bond (positive, negative), depression, alcohol use and abuse were tested. A 2-group, multiple-indicator, multiple-cause structural equation model with 441 (216 female, 225 male) college students was examined. In general, a poor al bond with one's father was highly predictive of depression, a well-known predictor of alcohol abuse and related problems for both genders. In contrast, a positive al bond with one's father significantly mediated the positive effects of authoritative fathering on depression, which then decreased alcohol use problems for both genders. For women, a negative al bond with one's father significantly mediated the effect of having an authoritarian father on depression, which increased alcohol use problems. These findings suggest that al influences on pathways to alcohol abuse through depression (primarily through fathers for both genders) are distinct from pathways stemming from poor impulse control (with influences primarily from the same-sex s for both genders)."
"Associations between parenting styles and nutrition knowledge and 2-5-year-old 's fruit, vegetable and non-core food consumption",2013,"Objective: During the early years, s have a major influence on 's diets and developing food choices. We investigated   as predictors of 2-5-year-old 's diets and whether general nutrition knowledge (GNK) mediated these influences. Design: Cross-sectional . Questionnaires measured demographic and life variables, family environment,   and feeding practices,  diet and GNK. Regression models tested GNK as a mediator of relationships between  variables and  diet (fruit/vegetable and non-core food consumption), controlling for confounders and family environment. Setting: Questionnaires were completed by main caregivers at home. Subjects: s of  aged 2-5 years (n 269). Results: Higher  fruit/vegetable consumption was associated with lower over-reactive  and restriction, higher authoritative  and dining together as a family; with lax  approaching statistical significance (P=0.083) and 19% of variance explained by the model. GNK was not a significant predictor. Conversely, non-core food consumption was associated with higher over-reactive and lax  as well as  age, increased takeaway food consumption and higher television viewing; GNK had a small effect (P=0.043) and 28% of variance was explained by the model. GNK was a significant mediator only for authoritative  on non-core food (effect = -0.005). Conclusions: These findings highlight that young 's diets may be improved by interventions targeting a range of positive and supportive  practices in conjunction with nutrition knowledge education for s of young . Further insights will come from closer attention to the nature and role of restrictive feeding practices v. laxness and longitudinal ."
The Moderating Effects of Parenting Styles on African-American and Caucasian Children's Suicidal Behaviors,2010,"Given that  practices have been linked to suicidal behavior in adolescence, examining the moderating effect of   on suicidal behavior early in development could offer potential insight into possible buffers as well as directions for suicide prevention and intervention later in adolescence. Hence, the moderating effects of  , including authoritarian, permissive, and features of authoritative , on depressed and aggressive 's suicidal behavior, including ideation and attempts, were evaluated with young  (N = 172; 72% male, 28% female) ranging from 6 to 12 years of age. African American (69%) and Caucasian (31%)  admitted for acute psychiatric inpatient care completed standardized measures of suicidal behavior, depressive symptoms, and proactive and reaction aggression. Their s  completed standardized measures of al distress and  . Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that, while statistically controlling for age and gender,  who endorsed more depressive symptoms or reactive aggression reported more current and past suicidal behavior than  who endorsed fewer depressive or aggressive symptoms. The significant positive relationship observed between depressive symptoms and hood suicidal behavior, however, was attenuated by al use of authoritarian  practices for African-American and older  but not for younger and Caucasian . The ethnic/racial difference observed for the buffering effect of authoritarian  practices offers potential theoretical and clinical implications for conceptualizing the moderating effects of   on African-American and Caucasian 's suicidal behavior."
"The relationship between parenting styles or parenting practices, and anxiety in hood and adolescence: a systematic review",2017,"Anxiety is one of the most common pathologies in the hood and adolescent population and it has a high comorbidity that sometimes makes diagnosis and treatment very difficult. It  tends to persist over time, causing great difficulties in the daily life of  and adolescents. In this review the empirical evidence for the relationship between   and practices and anxiety in  and adolescents is analysed based on twenty-two articles. Reasonably consistent evidence was found, based mainly on European populations, that lower levels of anxiety, or fewer anxiety symptoms or internalising symptoms were related to affection, warmth, and acceptance from s. In contrast, higher levels or more of these symptoms were linked to authoritarian , rejection, psychological control, excessive al control, over-involvement, rigid discipline, and hostile control. Furthermore, the review provided evidence of the need to develop preventive family education programmes and include  practices as an important part of the process for treating hood and adolescent anxiety."
Dyadic Parenting and Children's Externalizing Symptoms,2009,"We explore dyadic   and their association with first-grade 's externalizing behavior symptoms in a sample of 85 working-class, dual-earner families. Cluster analysis is used to create a typology of  types, reflecting the al warmth, overreactivity, and laxness of both mothers and fathers in two- families.

Is there something special about twin families? A comparison of parenting styles in twin and non-twin families,2020,"Twin comparisons offer a powerful quasi-experimental design to  the impact of the family of origin on 's life chances. Yet, there are concerns about the generalizability of  obtained from twin studies because twin families are structurally different and twins have a genetic resemblance. We examine these concerns by comparing mothers' reports on their   for twin and non-twin  between twin and non-twin families, as well as within twin families. We use two German studies for our comparisons: TwinLife and pairfam. Our  demonstrate that twins receive more differential treatment and more emotional warmth than non-twins; however, these differences are largely accounted for by age differences between . Overall, our  indicate that  on  obtained from twin studies can be generalized to non-twin families."
Adolescents' Filial Piety Attitudes in Relation to Their Perceived Parenting Styles: An Urban-Rural Comparative Longitudinal Study in China,2022,"The Dual Filial Piety Model (i.e., the model of reciprocal and authoritarian filial piety) offers a universally applicable framework for understanding essential aspects of intergenerational relations across diverse cultural contexts. The current  aimed to examine two important issues concerning this model that have lacked investigation: the roles of al socialization (i.e., authoritative and authoritarian  ) and social ecologies (i.e., urban vs. rural settings that differ in levels of economic development and modernization) in the development of reciprocal and authoritarian filial piety attitudes. To this end, a two-wave short-term longitudinal survey  was conducted among 850 early adolescents residing in urban (N = 314, 49.4% females, mean age = 13.31 years) and rural China (N = 536, 45.3% females, mean age = 13.72 years), who completed questionnaires twice, 6 months apart, in the spring semester of grade 7 and the fall semester of grade 8. Multigroup path analyses revealed bidirectional associations over time between perceived   and adolescents' filial piety attitudes, with both similarities and differences in these associations between urban and rural China. In both settings, perceived authoritative  predicted increased reciprocal filial piety 6 months later, whereas perceived authoritarian  predicted reduced reciprocal filial piety among urban (but not rural) adolescents over time. Moreover, in both settings, reciprocal filial piety predicted higher levels of perceived authoritative  and lower levels of perceived authoritarian  6 months later, with the latter effect being stronger among urban (vs. rural) adolescents. Adolescents' perceived   did not predict their authoritarian filial piety over time; however, authoritarian filial piety predicted higher levels of perceived authoritative  (but not perceived authoritarian ) 6 months later in both settings. The findings highlight the roles of transactional socialization processes between s and youth as well as social ecologies in the development of filial piety, thus advancing the understanding of how the universal human motivations underlying filial piety may function developmentally across different socioeconomic and sociocultural settings."
A cross-sectional investigation of parenting style and friendship as mediators of the relation between social class and mental health in a university community,2015,"Introduction: This  tested a novel explanation for the positive relation between social class and mental health among university students. Students with a higher social class were expected to have experienced more authoritative and less authoritarian  ; these   were expected to lead to greater friendship and social integration at university; and greater friendship and integration were expected to lead to better mental health. Method: To test this model, the ers asked 397 Australian undergraduate students to complete an online survey. The  used a cross-sectional correlational design, and the data was analysed using bootstrapped multiple serial mediation tests. Results: Consistent with predictions,  , general friendship and support, and social integration at university mediated the relation between social class and mental health. Conclusions: The   suggest that working-class   may inhibit the development of socially-supportive friendships that protect against mental health problems. The potential effectiveness of interventions based on (a) social integration and (b)   is discussed. Future  in this area should employ a longitudinal  design in order to arrive at clearer causal conclusions about the relations between social class,  , friendship, social integration, and mental health."
"The Influence of Parent Media Use, Parent Attitude on Media, and Parenting Style on Children's Media Use",2022,"s play a vital role in mediating 's media use, especially at a young age. We examined the link between the media use of younger  and the media use, attitude toward media, and   of s. One thousand and twenty s of  between 4 and 6 years of age completed a questionnaire on their media use, positive and negative attitudes on media,  , and the media use of their . Multigroup structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. The  showed that there was a significant positive relation between the 's media time and the 's daytime and nighttime media use. Additionally, the 's positive attitude toward media use was positively related to the 's daytime media use, but not the 's nighttime media use, while the 's negative attitude toward media was not associated with the 's daytime and nighttime media use. Further, among the seven  , material rewards and autonomy were positively associated with the 's daytime media use. Discipline was negatively related to the 's nighttime media use, whereas material rewards were positively associated with the 's nighttime media use. Collectively, the 's positive attitude toward media use was the strongest predictor of the 's daytime media use, and material rewards were the strongest predictor of the 's nighttime media use. These  can be of significant use to inform policymakers, ers, and s regarding the development of al guidelines on 's media use."
In the best interests of ? The paradox of intensive parenting and 's health,2021,"The family environment and al guidance are generally considered to be key drivers of 's health behaviours. s, mostly mothers, have become a focal point of policies aimed at preventing 's health and well-being problems (e.g. hood obesity). The underlying intensive  ideology places significant pressure on s (notably mothers), requiring them to spend a great deal of time, energy and money on their 's health and well-being. Yet, the relationship between intensive  and 's health might be paradoxical. While a clear positive relationship exists between al rearing  and 's physical health, the limited evidence in relation to psychological health suggests intensive  may negatively affect 's wellbeing. Using data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) we provide key insights into the relationship between   and 's physical and psychological well-being. We analytically distinguish three types of   (intensive , neglectful , and 'intermediate' ), and compare 's self-reported health, well-being and self-esteem by  . The findings show that   may differentially affect 's physical and psychological health in nuanced ways. Public health and social policy implications of the role of  in 's health and wellbeing are discussed. The conceptualisation of   and the relationship with 's health, however, requires further exploration, which we discuss in the conclusion."
"Associations Between Proactive and Reactive Aggression, Parenting Styles, and Externalizing Symptomatology in Children Admitted to a Psychiatric Inpatient Unit",2015,"Childhood aggression often precedes more costly problem behavior that may  in psychiatric hospitalization. Further understanding of the link between proactive and reactive functions of aggression and psychiatric problems would be useful for refining current prevention efforts and ultimately help reduce the number of hospitalizations. The current  examined  , gender, and age as potential moderators of the link between the proactive and reactive functions of physical aggression and more severe externalizing symptomatology [i.e., oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD) symptomatology]. Participants included 392  ages 6-12 years of age (M = 9.4, SD = 1.9) admitted consecutively to a psychiatric inpatient facility. Results indicated that both proactive and reactive aggression were associated with both ODD and CD symptoms. However,   were most influential on the association between proactive aggression and ODD symptoms for females and older . Implications and future directions are discussed."
"A Structural Equation Modeling of the Relationships Between Parenting Styles, Students' Personality Traits, and Students' Achievement Goal Orientation",2022,"Recently, ers have shown an increased interest in achievement goal orientation correlates. What is not yet clear is the detailed relationships among students' goal orientation, students' personality traits, and  . In so doing, this  responds to the need to analyze the importance of   (permissive, authoritative, and authoritarian) and students' traits (psychoticism, neuroticism, and extraversion) in explaining the achievement goal orientations (mastery approach, mastery avoidance, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance). In the exploratory correlational , 586 Iranian students along with their s were selected as the sample so as to evaluate the structure of the relationships between these variables. The  indicate that students' psychoticism and neuroticism predict students' goal orientations (positively: performance and mastery avoidance and negatively: mastery and performance approach) while extraversion did not. Only the authoritative  predicts mastery approach (positively) and psychoticism trait (negatively). Permissive and authoritarian  do not directly or indirectly predict students' goal orientations."
Brief Report: Parenting Styles and Obesity in Mexican American Children: A Longitudinal Study,2010,"Objective To assess longitudinally the relations between four   (authoritative, authoritarian, uninvolved, and indulgent) and  weight status in Mexican American families. Methods Sixty-nine low-income Mexican American mothers and their 4- to 8-year-old  participated in a 4-year longitudinal . Mothers completed demographic and  measures. Children's body weight and height were assessed annually. Body mass index was calculated to determine weight status. Results At baseline, 65% of  were found to be normal weight, 14% were overweight, and 21% were obese. Analyses examined how   at baseline predicted 's weight status 3 years later, controlling for initial weight status. Children of indulgent mothers were more likely to become overweight 3 years later than  of authoritative or authoritarian mothers. Conclusions This  provides longitudinal evidence for the role of indulgent  in predicting overweight in Mexican American . Possible mediating factors that may account for this relationship (e. g., dietary patterns, physical activity patterns, and 's self-regulation) are considered."
Significant differences in maternal -feeding style between ethnic groups in the UK: the role of deprivation and parenting styles,2018,"BackgroundNonresponsive maternal -feeding interactions, such as restricting, pressurising and emotional feeding, can affect the ability of a  to self-regulate intake and increase the risk of becoming overweight. However, despite findings that South Asian and Black  living in the UK are more likely to be overweight, UK  has not considered how maternal -feeding  might differ between ethnic groups. The   aimed to explore variations in maternal -feeding  between ethnic groups in the UK, taking into account associated factors such as deprivation and  . MethodsSix hundred and fifty-nine UK mothers with a  who was aged 5-11 years old completed a questionnaire. Items included ethnicity and demographic data, as well as copies of the Child Feeding Questionnaire, al Feeding Styles Questionnaire and  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire.

General parenting styles are not strongly associated with fruit and vegetable intake and social-environmental correlates among 11-year-old  in four countries in Europe,2009,"Objectives: To investigate whether fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake in 11-year-olds, and social-environmental correlates of F&V intake such as al modelling and encouragement, family food rules and home availability, differ according to general   in Belgium, The Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. Design: Cross-sectional . Setting: Primary schools in four countries. Subjects: Pupils and one of their s completed questionnaires to measure F&V intake, related social-environmental correlates and general  . The sample size was 4555 (49.3% boys); 1180 for Belgium, 883 for The Netherlands, 1515 for Portugal and 977 for Spain.   were divided into authoritative, authoritarian, indulgent and neglectful. Results: No differences were found in F&V intake across   and only very few significant differences in social-environmental correlates. The authoritarian (more al encouragement and more demands to eat fruit) and the authoritative (more availability of fruit and vegetables)   ed in more favourable correlates. Conclusion: Despite earlier studies Suggesting that general   are associated with health behaviours in , the   suggests that this association is weak to non-existent for F&V intakes in four different European countries."
"Marital satisfaction, parenting styles, and  outcomes in families of autistic Palabras clave(sic)(sic)(sic)",,"Theory and  on the general population suggest that s' marital relationship quality is associated with 's emotional and behavioral functioning directly, as well as indirectly, by affecting  attitudes and behaviors. However, little has been done to investigate the potential connection among  marital satisfaction,  , and outcomes for autistic . Using longitudinal data collected from 188 couples  an autistic , this  tested the time-ordered indirect effect of  marital satisfaction (assessed at Time 1) on the internalizing and externalizing symptoms (assessed at Time 3) of autistic  (originally aged 5-12 years) via   (assessed at Time 2) using actor-partner interdependence modeling extended to mediation. Results indicated that a lower level of marital satisfaction at Time 1 predicted impaired  outcomes at Time 3 via its impact on   at Time 2. For both s, lower marital satisfaction predicted more  externalizing symptoms via reports of more authoritarian  . Lower marital satisfaction in mothers at Time 1 was  associated with higher levels of  internalizing symptoms at Time 3 via increased authoritarian  in mothers. No partner effects were found. A family-wide approach that includes support for the  marital relationship, which may have downstream effects on , is important for promoting optimal emotional and behavioral health in autistic ."
"Parenting Style, Depressive Symptoms, and Substance Use in Mexican American Adolescents",2013,"This  of 151 Mexican American adolescents ages 12 to 15 examined the relationship between  and adolescents' self-reported level of depressive symptoms and substance use 6 months and 1 year later. Adolescents and their s were recruited from a large health-maintenance organization and interviewed at three time points. Lower levels of depressive symptoms were found for adolescents with more accepting mothers and fathers, and for those whose s exerted lower levels of strict control. Higher maternal acceptance was  consistently associated with lower levels of alcohol and marijuana use at follow-up assessments; strict control was not a useful predictor of substance use. Overall, al acceptance demonstrated consistent if modest relationships to adolescent mental health across the domains studied. We found little evidence for interactive relationships between  acceptance and control but some evidence for additive benefits of warmth and acceptance on the part of both s."
"College drinking behaviors: Mediational links between parenting styles, impulse control, and alcohol-related outcomes",2006,"Mediational links between   (authoritative, authoritarian, permissive), impulsiveness (general control), drinking control (specific control), and alcohol use and abuse were tested. A pattern-mixture approach (for modeling nonignorable missing data) with multiple-group structural equation models with 421 (206 female, 215 male) college students was used. Gender was examined as a potential moderator of   on control processes related to drinking. Specifically, the - gender match was found to have implications for increased levels of impulsiveness (a significant mediator of  effects on drinking control). These findings suggest that a  with a permissive   who is the same gender as the respondent can directly influence control processes and indirectly influence alcohol use and abuse."
Parenting Style and Adolescent Mental Health: The Chain Mediating Effects of Self-Esteem and Psychological Inflexibility,2021,"Based on interpersonal acceptance-rejection theory, family systems theory, and psychological inflexibility theory, this  aimed to examine the mediating roles of a protective factor (self-esteem) and a risk factor (psychological inflexibility) on the influence of   on adolescent mental health. A sample of Chinese adolescents (n = 916, 46% male, mean age = 14.44 years, SD = 1.84 years) completed the Short Egna Minnen Barndoms Uppfostran, the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, the Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, and the Depression Subscale of the Youth Self-Report. Results show that the self-esteem and psychological inflexibility play a chain mediating role in the relationship between   and adolescent mental health. Specifically, al emotional warmth had a positive effect on adolescent mental health through the chain mediating effects of self-esteem and psychological inflexibility. al rejection and al over-protection had negative effects on adolescent mental health by lowering self-esteem but increasing psychological inflexibility. These  provide further guidance in the prevention of and intervention in adolescent mental health problems."
Psychometric Properties of the Lithuanian Version of the Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ): Pilot Study,2012,"The internal consistency reliability and structure-related validity of the Lithuanian version of  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ), a 32-item instrument originally developed to assess the  behavior of s of 4- to 12-year-olds, was the focus of the  . The translated instrument was completed by 265 s (mostly mothers) of nonclinical elementary school-aged  from a metro school district in Lithuania. In this pilot , it was found that the PSDQ Lithuanian version had preliminary sufficient internal consistency reliability and structure-related validity similar to those reported by the authors of the original instrument. However, the PSDQ Lithuanian version still needs further studies with a more balanced gender reation, larger sample, and more diverse number of schools for exploring the psychometric properties more thoroughly. Nevertheless, in that there are few instruments on  that have already been translated and used with Lithuanian s; the authors believe that this pilot  is a very important first step in the process of creating a valid and reliable instrument based on Baumrind's  model."
"The effects of stimulant therapy, EEG biofeedback, and parenting style on the primary symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder",2002,"One hundred , ages 6 19, who were diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), either inattentive or combined types, participated in a  examining the effects of Ritalin, EEG biofeedback, and   on the primary symptoms of ADHD. All of the patients participated in a 1-year multimodal, outpatient program that included Ritalin,  counseling, and academic support at school (either a 504 Plan or an IEP). Fifty-one of the participants  received EEG biofeedback therapy. Posttreatment assessments were conducted both with and without stimulant therapy. Significant improvement was noted on the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA; L. M. Greenberg, 1996) and the Attention Deficit Disorders Evaluation Scale (ADDES; S. B. McCarney, 1995) when participants were tested while using Ritalin. However only those who had received EEG biofeedback sustained these gains when tested without Ritalin. The  of a Quantitative Electroencephalographic Scanning Process (QEEG-Scan; V. J. Monastra et al., 1999) revealed significant reduction in cortical slowing only in patients who had received EEG biofeedback. Behavioral measures indicated that   exerted a significant moderating effect on the expression of behavioral symptoms at home but not at school."
"Associations of parenting styles, parental feeding practices and  characteristics with young 's fruit and vegetable consumption",2010,"The purpose of this  was to investigate the role of  and  characteristics in explaining 's fruit and vegetable intakes. In 2008, s of preschoolers (mean age 3.5 years) from 56 schools in Belgium-Flanders completed questionnaires including a  and  fruit and vegetable food frequency questionnaire, general   (laxness, overreactivity and positive interactions), specific food  practices (-centered and -centered feeding practices) and 's characteristics ('s shyness, emotionality, stubbornness, activity, sociability, and negative reactions to food). Multiple linear regression analyses (n = 755) indicated a significant positive association between 's fruit and vegetable intake and 's intake and a negative association with 's negative reactions to food. No general   dimension or  personality characteristic explained differences in 's fruit and vegetable intakes. Child-centered feeding practices were positively related to 's fruit and vegetable intakes, while -centered feeding practices were negatively related to 's vegetable intakes. In order to try to increase 's fruit and vegetable consumption, s should be guided to improve their own diet and to use -centered  practices and strategies known to decrease negative reactions to food.

Adolescent-to-Mother Psychological Aggression: The Role of Father Violence and Maternal Parenting Style,2019,"Background: Adolescent-to- psychological aggression is often a precursor to physical aggression toward their s. Recently, there have been 4 high-profile matricide cases that happened in China. To date, there is limited  in Confucian filial piety culture on -to- psychological aggression, especially toward the mother who is overwhelming the target of 's aggression. Objective: The goal of this  is to explore the prevalence of adolescent-to-mother psychological aggression and examine the role of father violence and maternal   in contributing to these behaviors in Confucian filial piety culture. Methods: Participants were 1134 students from 7 to 12 grade (M = 14 years, SD = 1.5) in Qingdao located in Shandong Province in east side of China where the Confucian Culture began. The instruments used were a demographics questionnaire, adolescent-to-mother psychological aggression questionnaire, father's violent behavior questionnaire and maternal   questionnaire. Result: Two types of adolescent-to-mother psychological aggression were assessed: contempt and rebellion. The prevalence of adolescent-to-mother contempt and rebellion was 30.7% and 18.7%, respectively. Results from multiple regression analyses indicated that father's conflict with grands, maternal control and over-protection were positively associated with adolescent's contempt for mother. s divorced, father's conflict with grands, father-to-mother physical violence and maternal rejection were positively associated with adolescent's rebellion against mother. Maternal emotional warmth was negatively associated with adolescent's contempt and rebellion against mother. Conclusion: Adolescent-to-mother psychological aggression occurs within a broader family context of violence and disharmony. Observational learning of father's conflict with grands or violent behaviors toward mother maybe the mechanism of violence passing from generations. However, maternal emotional warmth buffered the negative association between father's conflict with grands and adolescent's contempt for mother. But maternal control and over-protection exacerbated the positive relationships between father's conflict with grands and adolescent's contempt for mother."
"Parenting Style, Parent-Youth Conflict, and Medication Adherence in Youth With Type 2 Diabetes Participating in an Intensive Lifestyle Change Intervention",2014," behaviors and family conflict relate to type 1 diabetes outcomes in youth. Our purpose was to understand these relationships in s and youth with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The TODAY (Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth) trial enrolled youth (10-17 years) with T2DM and /guardian. For this ancillary , we enrolled a sample of youth- pairs (N = 137) in 1  arm (metformin plus life intervention). They completed questionnaires measuring   related to normative (e. g., completing homework) and diabetes self-care (e. g., testing blood glucose) tasks, and -youth verbal conflict (baseline, 6, and 12 months).   was consistent across normative and diabetes tasks, with gradual increases in autonomy perceived by youth. Conversations were generally calm, with greater conflict regarding normative than diabetes tasks at baseline (youth: p < .001, : p = .01), 6 months (youth: p = .02, : p > .05), and 12 months (youth: p > .05., : p = .05). A permissive   toward normative tasks and a less authoritarian  toward diabetes tasks, at baseline, predicted better medication adherence (8-12 months) (normative: adjusted R-2 = 0.48, p < .001; diabetes: adjusted R-2 = 0.47, p < .001). -youth conflict did not predict medication adherence. Youth with T2DM who perceive more autonomy (less al control) in day-to-day and diabetes tasks are more likely to adhere to medication regimens. It may be valuable to assess youth perceptions of   and help s understand youths' needs for autonomy."
Contextualizing Video Game Play: The Moderating Effects of Cumulative Risk and Parenting Styles on the Relations Among Video Game Exposure and Problem Behaviors,2015,"This  examined the direct and moderated relations associated with video game exposure and  behavior problems (i.e., hyperactivity, inattention). Research linking video game exposure to these problem behaviors is inconsistent likely because studies have used measures that combine elements of both problems in the same scale and because key contextual factors associated with video game play (i.e., cumulative family risk,  , video game content) are not included or have been covaried out. A nationally reative group of US s/caregivers of 788 preschoolers (2-5 years) and 391 school-age  (6-8 years) were interviewed by phone and asked to report their 's video game exposure via a 24-hr time diary, demographic information, their  , and their 's hyperactivity levels and attention problems. Separate regressions by age were conducted. Video game exposure was directly associated only with increasing levels of hyperactivity in preschool , an effect reduced to nonsignificance when   were covaried out. Adding cumulative risk and   as moderators increased the amount of variance accounted for across both the preschool and school-age samples. Responsive  moderated the effects of video game exposure for low-risk preschoolers' and high-risk school-age 's hyperactivity levels and high-risk preschoolers' and low-risk school-age 's attention problems. In the final set of models with video game exposure broken into violent and nonviolent content, different patterns of effects and larger effect sizes emerged across cumulative risk, responsiveness, and nonviolent video game exposure. Violent video game exposure was associated only with low-risk school-age 's hyperactivity levels."
Parenting Influences on Perceived Adolescent Health Risks: A Mixed Methods Approach,2019,"ObjectivesWe explored how varying  practices might be related to adolescents and their s' perceived adolescent susceptibility toward high-risk health behaviors.MethodsA mixed-methods  was conducted with 31 Chinese/Taiwanese American, African American, and European American -adolescent dyads/triads. Two rounds of interviews (a total of 148) were undertaken with 78 participants 4-6 months apart to understand al strategies in protecting their adolescents from risky health behaviors. The  Style questionnaires were administered to the /s to examine the congruence with  practices reported in qualitative interviews. Findings of interviews and Perception of Adolescent Health Risks questionnaires were synthesized to gain a better understanding about the relationship between  practices and participants' perceived adolescent susceptibility toward high-risk health behaviors. Qualitative  were used to help understand and clarify the quantitative .ResultsOur  indicated that diverse s'  practices were influenced by their situational and historical experiences as well as their cultural and religious beliefs. Health-related  (i.e., when and how to intervene) were related to s' perceived susceptibility of adolescents' health risks.ConclusionsConsistent with the literature, a permissive   was associated with low perceived susceptibility to health risks. Authoritarian or authoritative  , however, were not significantly related to health risk perception. Furthermore, the  Style measure seemed to not fully capture diverse families'  practices reported in the qualitative . Future  needs to incorporate influences stemming from families' situational, historical, cultural, and religious experiences."
"Influence of Parental Alcohol-Related Attitudes, Behavior and Parenting Styles on Alcohol Use in Late and Very Late Adolescence",2014,"s influence adolescent drinking behavior, but to what extent does this association diminish with age, however? The cross-sectional data was drawn from the Scania drug use survey 2007, consisting of 4,828 secondary education students in the 9th and 11th grade. The age-and gender-adjusted findings indicate that having s who are consenting to alcohol use (OR 1.4), having been provided with alcohol by one's s (OR 1.8), having s with an authoritarian (OR 1.5) or neglectful (OR 2.1)  , and having s who both have a university degree (OR 1.3) were factors significantly associated with monthly heavy episodic drinking. These findings lead to the conclusion that   as well as al attitudes and behaviors are important throughout the high school years. Thus, prevention targeting s should emphasize both these domains.

How is gambling related to perceived parenting style and/or family environment for college students?,2013,"Background and aims: The relationship between college student gambling,  , and family environments is a neglected area of gambling . Do   indirectly influence problem gambling behaviors via family environments? Do poor family environments, characterized by high levels of conflict and low levels of cohesion, increase the likelihood of problem gambling among youth? This  explored the interrelationships among college students' current gambling behaviors and a) having an emotionally close and supportive family environment, b) having nagging and critical s, c) having an authoritative mother, and d) frequency of alcohol consumption. Methods and : Survey data were collected from 450 undergraduate students enrolled in introductory psychology classes at two state universities in a southern state. Feeling that one has nagging and critical s was associated with gambling in more venues, while the opposite was true for having emotionally close and supportive families. However, perceptions of having authoritative mothers were not related to gambling. The   showed that more frequent alcohol consumption was associated with higher odds of gambling in casinos, playing cards for money, betting on sports, gambling on the Internet, higher gambling losses, and a larger number of gambling venues. Conclusions: As with any exploratory , there are several unique lines of inquiry that can, and should, follow from these findings, including more  on how college students' attitudes toward gambling activities may have begun prior to college and been influenced by their feelings about their homes and s."
"Parental Style, Dating Violence and Gender",2019,"The relationship between   and teen dating violence has become a relevant  topic in recent years, especially related to violence inflicted online. To more fully understand this relationship, the objective of the   was to examine which   (authoritarian, indulgent, authoritative, or neglectful) best protects against dating violence in adolescent relationships. A total of 1132 adolescents of both sexes participated in this  (46.4% boys and 53.6% girls), with ages between 14 and 18 years old (M = 15.6, SD = 1.3). A multivariate factorial design was applied (MANOVA, 4 x 2), using the  , the s' gender, and the adolescents' gender as independent variables, and the dating violence dimensions (online and offline) as dependent variables. As the  show, the lowest scores on all the dating violence dimensions examined were obtained by adolescents from indulgent families. In addition, three interaction effects were observed between the mother's   and the adolescent's gender on online violence (e-violence and control), and the father's   on offline violence (verbal-emotional). Thus, adolescents with authoritarian mothers obtained the highest scores on violence and control inflicted online, respectively, and adolescent girls with authoritarian fathers obtained the highest scores on verbal-emotional violence. These findings suggest that the indulgent  is the   that protects against violence in teen dating relationships, and they  highlight the risks of the authoritarian  as a family -rearing model."
Impact of rewarding and parenting styles on young 's cheating behavior,2017,"The purpose of this  was to examine the impact of rewarding and   on kindergarteners' cheating behavior. The participants were 77 young  enrolled in one of three public kindergartens in the Sanlurfa province of Turkey. Ages ranged from 54 to 76months, with a mean age of 67.36months (SD=4.69). Participants were randomly assigned to reward and control groups. Each participant was tested individually. Participants were asked to solve a labyrinth puzzle without looking at the solution in the absence of an applicator ( assistants). Reward group participants were informed that if they successfully solved the puzzle they would get a lollipop. Findings revealed that the reward group exhibited significantly more cheating behavior than the control group. Cheating behavior was not related to  .

Do Parenting Style and Adolescents' Self-esteem Contribute to Mental Health Problems among Young Adolescents in Malaysia? An Adolescents' Perspective,2020,"Introduction: Adolescence is a crucial phase in life, as this is the time when they are developing their identity, while at the same time forming relationships with others, including their family members. This  investigated adolescents' mental health status in Malaysia and its associated factors including selfesteem and   that are experienced by them. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional  was conducted among 248 school-going adolescents aged 13 and 14 years in Selangor, Malaysia. The validated Malay version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was utilized to assess adolescents' mental health status. In addition, the adolescents' self-esteem was  assessed using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale Questionnaire while the al Bonding Instrument was used to assess their 's  . Results: Almost 20% of the adolescents were found to have mental health problems such as emotional and conduct problems, hyperactivity disorder and peer problems. Using multivariate analysis, factors that were associated with mental health problems were family income (AOR=2.788, 95% CI=1.397, 5.563), adolescents' self-esteem (AOR=0.799, 95% CI=0.668, 0.955) and their perception on al control (AOR=1.175, 95% CI=1.020, 1.353). Conclusion: This  shows that one fifth of these adolescents had mental health problems. Low socio-economic factors, over controlling s and poor self-esteem were associated with these problems.

These scales classified mothers into four   as follows: authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, or neglectful. The social competence was  categorized into effective relationship, problem solving skills, use of basic social skills dimensions. The mean scores of the adolescents' social competence whose mothers had permissive and authoritative   was higher than that for the two other groups for all the dimensions (p < 0.05). The  showed that with the expectation of controlling roles, the supportive role of mothers can be more effective in providing opportunities for social competence performance."
"The influences of information literacy, internet addiction and parenting styles on internet risks",2012,"The purpose of this  is to examine how demographics, addiction symptoms, information literacy,   and internet activities can predict 'internet risks'. Data were gathered from a probability sample of 718 adolescents and teenagers, aged 9-19 in Hong Kong, using face-to-face interviews. Results show that adolescents who are often targets of harassment tend to be older boys with a high family income. They are targets probably because they spend a lot of time on social networking sites (SNSs) and prefer the online setting. Adolescents who encounter a lot of unwelcome solicitation of personal or private information online tend to be older girls. In information literacy, they are generally very competent with publishing tools but are not structurally literate, especially in understanding how information is socially situated and produced. Implications and recommendations for future  are discussed."
Parenting Style among Indonesian Parents of a Child with Autism Spectrum Disorder: Associations with Socio-Economic Status and Social Supports,2019,"Socio-economic status (SES) and social supports have been strongly linked with both authoritarian and authoritative   among s of  with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Western countries.

The aim of the   was to investigate the relationships among SES, social supports and   among Indonesian s of  with ASD. One hundred and one Indonesian s of a  with ASD completed the survey. SES and social supports both emerged as unique predictors of   for these s, although the direction of the association with SES was unexpected. For Indonesian s of  with ASD, lower SES and more supports predicted more authoritative and less authoritarian . This  supports existing evidence for associations among   and social supports, but raises questions about the cultural meanings of these   for s with a  with ASD in Indonesia."

"Dysfunctional parenting styles, empathy and socio-demographic variables in Nursing, Human Medicine and Psychology students",2019,"The objective of this  was to establish the relationship between dysfunctional   and empathy in Nursing, Human Medicine and Psychology students. The 's sample consisted of 599 students, from both genders, and from different cycles of their university studies. Their ages ranged between 21 and 25 years. To assess them, the Dysfunctional  Styles Scale by Parker, et al. (1979) was used, previously adapted to Peruvian population. The participants were  evaluated with the Personal and Professional Empathy Scale designed by Yaraskavitch (2009), and completed a socio-demographic data sheet created ad hoc. General  showed no significant relationships between the dysfunctional   and empathy total scores. In contrast, considering the father figure, an inverse relationship between the authoritarian-controlling dysfunctional   and the personal and professional cognitive empathy was found, while the indifference - negligence dysfunctional   was inversely associated with the emotive personal empathy. As to the mother figure, there is a significant and direct relationship between authoritarian-controlling dysfunctional   and personal and professional emotive empathy. It was  found that regarding gender, women have higher levels of empathy. With respect to professional degree courses, Nursing students have a higher level of empathy than Medicine and Psychology students, while Medicine students have more dysfunctional   than the Nursing and Psychology groups. Finally, students that had taken personal development courses showed a higher level of empathy."
Students' recollections of parenting styles and impostor phenomenon: The mediating role of social anxiety,2021,"Glance and Imes (1978) introduced a phenomenon regarding individuals who tend to experience intellectual phoniness and covert perceived inadequacy, which they termed impostor phenomenon. The current  aims to investigate the relationship between the impostor phenomenon and social anxiety in adult students, while inspecting the latter variable's mediating role in the relationship between students' recollections of their s'   and their current impostor expressions. The  comprised 247 students, 185 females and 62 males (Mage = 28.27, SD = 8.22), who completed online forms of the al Bonding Instrument (PBI), the Glance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS), and the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN). The participants' social anxiety was positively correlated (at medium to strong size) with their impostor expressions. Perceived al care was indirectly associated with the students' impostor expressions through social anxiety for mothers and fathers, meaning that the sample's students who perceived their s as less caring exhibited greater impostor expressions because they were more socially anxious. Also, perceived paternal overprotection was associated with the students' impostor expressions through social anxiety. Namely, students who perceived their fathers as more overprotective had greater impostor expressions because they were more socially anxious. The etiological significances and applied implications of these findings are discussed."
Children's perceptions of dissimilarity in parenting styles are associated with internalizing and externalizing behavior,2012,"The purpose of this  was to examine the relationship between 's perception of dissimilarity in  , and internalizing and externalizing problems in .

"Socioeconomic Status, Mothers' Parenting Style, High Media Use, and the Language and Moths Skills of Kindergarten Children",2010,"The aim of the   was to describe the current use of and access to electronic media of kindergarten , with regard to age, gender, socioeconomic status, and mother's   (N= 748 families). Furthermore cross-sectional links between different media use and the 's language and maths skills were explored (N= 468 families). Relevant covariates were controlled, e. g. socioeconomic status, IQ or behavior problems. Results: Kindergarten  had access to various electronic media and showed higher media use predominantly with growing age, lower socioeconomic status and male gender. An unfavorable   was linked independently from the socioeconomic status with higher television and videogame use, as well as lower audiotape use. Lower language skills were linked positive with higher videogame use, as well as lower audiotape and computer use. On the other hand lower maths skills were linked with higher television and videogame use, as well as lower computer and audiotape use. The  agreed in part with a socioeconomic-mainstreaming hypothesis."
Parenting Styles and Gang Membership: Mediating Factors,2017,"While literature suggests that  has direct and indirect effects on gang membership, mediating effects have been established for the relationship between unidimensional  variables and gang involvement. This  fills the gap in the literature by examining how multidimensional   affect gang membership, and which factors mediate this relationship. The logistic regression models indicate a negative relationship between authoritative  and gang involvement, and a positive relationship between authoritarian, neglectful, and permissive  and gang membership. The analyses show that delinquent peers, self-control, rationalizations, and guilt are complete or partial mediators of   and gang membership."
Predicting the Theory of Mind Precursors Based on Parenting Styles and Language Skills in Preschool Children,2021,"Objective The current  aimed to investigate the association between language skills and   and three levels of theory of mind (including emotion recognition, false belief understanding, and second-order belief) among Iranian preschool . Materials & Methods A total of 98 preschool Iranian  (aged 5-6 years) living in the Karaj province, Iran were recruited. While the theory of mind test and test of language development (Told-p: 4) were administrated on , their mothers were asked to answer a   questionnaire. Results Multivariate regression analysis showed a differential association between three levels of theory of mind, language skills, and  . Most language skills and permissiveness   could predict the emotion recognition ability (P<0.01). Morphological completion predicted false belief understanding (p<0.01). Also, word articulation and authoritative   could predict the ability to understand second-order belief (R2=28%). Conclusion The pattern of associations between language and theory of mind in the Persian language seems similar to previous studies in other languages. Language may play a dual role in the theory of mind. Whereas for the first (basic) and the third (advanced) level of theory of mind, language skills, like relational vocabulary, morphological completion, and word articulation, are general and nonspecific predictors, but syntactical skills are a specific casual predictor for the false belief understanding. Also, it seems that an authoritative   could facilitate the development of higher-order abilities related to the theory of mind ."
Effect of Ethnicity on Parenting Styles and Attitudes Toward Violence Among Jewish and Arab Muslim Israeli Mothers: An Intergenerational Approach,2015,"The cultural heterogeneity of Israeli society creates a unique opportunity to  the effects of ethnicity and intergenerational differences on  , attitudes, and practices. Three groups of mother-daughter dyads took part in the : Native-born Jewish (NBJ) Israelis (155 dyads), Jewish Mizrahi (JM) immigrants (immigrants from Muslim countries (133 dyads), and native-born Arab Muslim (NBA) Israelis (86 dyads). Participants were located through a snowball process in which participants referred their friends to the ers or gave the ers names of potential participants. Interethnic differences were found in the mothers' generation, with JM mothers falling in between NBJ and NBA mothers. This trend changed when we examined differences between the daughters. Although intergenerational differences were found in all groups, the differences were more prominent among Jewish mother-daughter dyads than among mother-daughter dyads in the Muslim population. Contrary to the  hypothesis, the   of JM women was closer to that of NBJ mothers than to NBA mothers. The findings are discussed with reference to the complexity of Israeli society and to the encounter between the culture of the immigrant women who came from Muslim countries and the Western culture of the host society."
Mainland Chinese parenting styles and parent -  interaction,2005,"  and mother- interaction were examined with 97 Mainland Chinese mothers ( M age = 29.64 years, SD = 3.64) and their young  (M = 24.30 months, SD = 4.57). Mothers completed questionnaires about their  , orientation to Chinese cultural values, perceived  stress, and sources of social support. The regression analyses showed that mothers' adherence to Chinese values was associated with both authoritative and authoritarian  . Other characteristics of the family contexts, such as perceived  distress, social support, and years of education,  contributed to Chinese mothers'  . Mother- dysfunctional interaction was associated with mothers' heightened  distress, a lack of perceived social support, and perceptions of 's difficultness. Group comparisons revealed that Chinese mothers who had high scores for both authoritative and authoritarian   adhered most strongly to the Chinese cultural values. The findings suggest that the aspects of families' eco-cultural settings such as mothers' endorsement of Chinese cultural values and perceived  stress contribute to their   and interaction with their ."
Parental Self-Efficacy Predicted by Parents' Subjective Well-Being and Their Parenting Styles with Possible Role of Help-Seeking Orientation from Teachers,2021,"The current  aims to test the ideas that al self-efficacy is associated with  , s' help-seeking orientation from teachers, and subjective well-being. Based on the literature background ed, two hypotheses were examined: First, autonomy help-seeking orientation, the authoritative  , and high subjective well-being would be positive predictors of al self-efficacy. Second, dependent help-seeking orientation and non-authoritative   are negative predictors of al self-efficacy. One hundred and thirty-two s of school-age  answered questionnaires measuring the  and background variables. A multivariate regression analysis found that the independent variables explain about 53% of the variance of the al self-efficacy scores, with subjective well-being and the authoritative   being uniquely associated with high al self-efficacy, and the permissive   being uniquely associated with low al self-efficacy. The   focuses on al self-efficacy as an important al component, demonstrating the personal characteristics of s that may affect their perceived efficacy, and offers an integrative portrait of factors that can describe s' attitudes and behavior toward their competence as s. Implications for intervention are discussed."

We explored the role of the Dark Triad traits on the al  that individuals fad important in a future spouse. Men (n = 179) and women (n = 181) completed a short Dark Triad measure, and a questionnaire measuring desirability of al care and control in future partners. Narcissism predicted higher preference for spouses with controlling  . Men and women high on Machiavellianism were more and less likely to prefer a caring partner, respectively. Individuals high on psychopathy were less likely to favour a partner displaying al care. The findings are discussed in terms of assortative mating and social learning."
Education Expenditure and Parenting Styles: Evidence from Cognitive Development in China,2021,"Does education spending affect al investment in human capital, such as  practices? If so, is the influence positive or negative? Using pooled cross-sectional data from the China Family Panel Studies, this  investigated whether and how  practices were affected by education expenditure across provinces using instrumental variable estimations. The  were as follows: (1) s in regions with higher education spending were more likely to obtain a higher score on control behavior, a dimension related to al demandingness, involvement, and monitoring; (2) s in regions with lower education spending were more likely to show harshness, a behavior associated with hostility, punitiveness, and coercion, towards their  and adopt harsh  practices, such as physical punishment and scolding. These  jointly indicated that s in environments with greater education spending tend to adopt an authoritative  practice, which is considered the most effective  . The findings of this  highlight the importance of education spending in improving educational attainments and reveal a spillover effect from school to family in human capital formation."
The Mediating Role of Korean Immigrant Mothers' Psychological Well-Being in the Associations between Social Support and Authoritarian Parenting Style,2018,"We examined the mediating role of Korean immigrant mothers' psychological well-being in the associations between mothers' emotional vs. instrumental support received from their kin, and their authoritarian   with their preschoolers using longitudinal data. First-generation Korean immigrant mothers with preschool-aged  (N = 158; M (maternal age) = 36.11 years, SD = 3.90; M ( age) = 4.43 years, SD = 1.10) residing in Maryland, U.S., participated in three assessment waves. Each assessment wave was 6 months apart. Mothers reported on the amount of perceived emotional and instrumental support they received from their kin, their behavioral acculturation towards the American culture, and their family demographic information at Wave 1, their psychological well-being at Wave 2, and their authoritarian   at Wave 3. The  revealed that higher levels of perceived instrumental support (but not emotional support) received from kin predicted higher levels of maternal psychological well-being 6 months later, which in turn predicted lower levels of reported authoritarian   6 months later. Our findings highlighted the importance of psychological well-being as a mechanism that explains how instrumental support can impact Korean immigrant mothers'  , and the importance of distinguishing between types of support. Services providing instrumental support (e.g., care assistance) for first-generation immigrant mothers, particularly those with smaller or less effective kin networks, appear important to implement."
"Parenting, personality, and culture as predictors of perfectionism",2020,"This  examined the relationship between  , personality traits, culture, and perfectionism. Male and female undergraduate university students from the US (n = 168) and the Middle East (n = 74) completed self-report measures regarding their perceptions of how they were ed, the Big Five Personality Inventory, and two multidimensional measures of perfectionism. As predicted, authoritarian and neglectful  was positively correlated with maladaptive forms of perfectionism; they were  positively correlated with personal standards, but only authoritarian  was significantly correlated with self-oriented perfectionism. In terms of personality and perfectionism, conscientiousness was positively correlated with adaptive dimensions of perfectionism (personal standards, organization, and self-oriented perfectionism), whereas emotional stability was negatively associated with the maladaptive dimensions of perfectionism (al criticism, doubts about abilities, concerns about mistakes, and socially prescribed perfectionism).  was more predictive than personality regarding al expectations, al criticism, and socially prescribed perfectionism, while personality was more predictive of doubts about abilities, concern over mistakes, personal standards, organization, and self-oriented perfectionism. Middle Eastern participants scored significantly higher than US participants on al expectations and self-oriented perfectionism."
Emotional and Behavioral Problems Associated with Attachment Security and Parenting Style in Adopted and Non-Adopted Children,2014,"Objective: This  aimed to investigate and compare emotional and behavioral problems in Turkish adoptees and non-adopted peers raised by their biological s. Materials and Methods: The  included 61 adopted  (34 female and 27 male) aged 6-18 years and 62 age- and gender-matched non-adopted  (35 female and 27 male). s rated their 's problem behaviors using the Child Behavior Checklist/6-18, temperament characteristics using the School Age Temperament Inventory, their own personality traits using the Basic Personality Traits Inventory, and their   using the Measure of Child Rearing Styles. Children rated their s' availability and reliability as attachment figures using the Kerns Security Scale and   using the Measure of Child Rearing Styles. Adolescents aged 1118 years self-rated their problem behaviors using the Youth Self Report. Group differences and correlations were analyzed. Results: There were non-significant differences in all scale scores between the adopted and non-adopted groups. In contrast to the literature, age of the  at the time of adoption was not associated with problem behaviors or attachment relationships. On the other hand, the findings indicate that as the age at which the  learned that they had been adopted increased emotional and behavioral problems increased. Conclusion: Adoption alone could not explain the problem behaviors observed in the adopted ; the observed problem behaviors should be considered within the context of the developmental process."
Perceived Parenting Scale (PPS): psychometric measures for current family configurations,2020,"The main objective of this  was to analyze a psychometric measure of perceived  adaptable to current family configurations and  topics in the area. For that a sample of adolescents (n = 443, MAGE = 15.49 years old, SDAGE = 1.85, 50.6% male, 49.4% female) and a sample of adults was studied (n = 512, MAGE = 40.83 years old, SDAGE = 15.05, 49.6% male, 50.4% female) using a measure specially designed to meet this end. The analyses concluded in a twenty-item measure (Perceived  Scale; PPS) that can be used in adolescents (PPS-ADO) and adults (PPS-ADU) from diverse type of families. The measure entails validity evidences that give empirical support to its bidimensional structure in all of its versions and that enable comparative studies of the  obtained in any of them.

Morality and Values in Sports Among Young Athletes: The Role of Sport Type and Parenting Styles - A Pilot Study,2021,"Given the great importance of morality and values in modern sports, especially among young athletes, in this pilot , we sought to broaden the exploration of the factors that may play role in these contexts, which have not been widely ed to date. Accordingly, the  tested the relationships between sport type (team or individual) and   (authoritative vs. non-authoritative), and moral decision-making in sport and sport values among 110 adolescent athletes whose age ranges from 11 to 22 (M = 16.04, SD = 2.86). The findings indicated that participants with authoritative s, as compared to those with non-authoritative s, are significantly less accepting of cheating in sport, while they  tend more to keep winning in proportion and hold significantly stronger moral values toward sports. Moreover, participants whose main sport is a team sport type tend to accept more cheating and gamesmanship than participants whose main sport is an individualistic sport type. While no differences were recorded between these groups in moral values, team athletes tend to value status in sport more than individual athletes, while the latter tend to value competence regarding their sport. The implications of the findings are discussed in light of no interaction between the effects of   and sport type on moral and sport values."
Negative Maternal and Paternal Parenting Styles as Predictors of Children's Behavioral Problems: Moderating Effects of the Child's Sex,2015,"Mothers and fathers often adopt different approaches to raising their , and the influence of different   on the development of behavioral problems may be different for boys and girls.

Children were evaluated for aggressive behavior with peers using the Direct and Indirect Aggression Scale at age 8-9. Our  show that an authoritarian maternal  is positively associated with both 's externalizing and internalizing problems while the combination of an authoritarian maternal  and a permissive paternal  was negatively associated with internalizing problems, but only in boys, and this type of family was positively associated with both types of aggressive behavior in girls and boys. Besides, the combination of a permissive maternal  and a permissive paternal  was positively related to girls' (but not boys') physical aggression."
Association between morningness-eveningness and the severity of compulsive Internet use: the moderating role of gender and parenting style,2013,"Background: Eveningness and Internet addiction are major concerns in adolescence and young adulthood. We investigated the relationship between morningness-eveningness and compulsive Internet use in young adults and explored the moderating effects of perceived   and family support on such relationships. Methods: The participants consisted of 2731 incoming college students (men, 52.4%; mean age, 19.4 +/- 3.6 years) from a National University in Taiwan. Each participant completed the questionnaires, which included the Morningness-Eveningness Scale (MES), the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for Internet use (YBOCS-IU), the al Bonding Instrument for  , the Family Adaptation, Partnership, Growth, Affection, and Resolve questionnaire (APGAR) for perceived family support, and the Adult Self-Report Inventory-4 (ASRI-4) for psychopathology. The morning (n = 459), intermediate (n = 1878), and evening (n = 394) groups were operationally defined by the MES t scores. Results: The  showed that eveningness was associated with greater weekend sleep compensation, increased compulsive Internet use, more anxiety, poorer  , and less family support; additionally, the most associated variables for increased compulsive Internet use were the tendency of eveningness, male gender, more anxiety symptoms, less maternal affection/care, and a lower level of perceived family support. The negative association between the morning type and compulsive Internet use severity escalated with increased maternal affection/care and decreased with increased perceived family support. The positive association between the evening type and compulsive Internet use severity declined with increased maternal protection. However, the father's   did not influence the relationship between morningness-eveningness and compulsive Internet use severity. Conclusions: Our findings imply that sleep schedule and the al and family process should be part of specific measures for prevention and intervention of compulsive Internet use. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.

The effects of perceived parenting style on the propensity for illicit drug use: the importance of parental warmth and control,2008,"Introduction and Aims. Research in adolescents has shown that al warmth and control are important factors in drug use. The   focused upon investigating perceived al warmth and control in a sample of post-adolescent ecstasy/polydrug users, and investigating their relationship to severity of drug use. Design and Methods. A total of 128 (65 male) ecstasy/polydrug users, 51 (17 male), cannabis-only users and 54 (13 male) non-users were recruited from a university population. All participants completed the   and drug use questionnaires. Results. Compared to non-users, a greater proportion of ecstasy/polydrug users characterised their s'  as neglectful. The modal  endorsed by non-users was authoritative. Those who rated their s'  as authoritative had significantly lower lifetime consumption and average dose of ecstasy relative to those describing their s as neglectful. Again, relative to those describing their s as neglectful, participants from authoritarian backgrounds had significantly smaller lifetime consumption of ecstasy and cocaine and significantly smaller average doses of cannabis, ecstasy and cocaine. Contrary to expectation, there was no significant association between perceived al warmth and the severity of ecstasy use. Discussion and Conclusions. The   is, to our knowledge, the first to quantify drug use, and relate it to perceived al practices in a post-adolescent sample of ecstasy/polydrug users. The  provide further support for the relationship between perceived al control and drug use."

Mothers were  asked questions regarding their perceived control over their 's daily lives, and the 's tendency to engage in high-risk behaviors. s with the highest levels of marital conflict and the lowest levels of satisfaction, valued authoritarian  more often, and were less likely to adhere to authoritative methods. Regarding control, mothers in conflictual marriages were less likely to control the indoor and outdoor activities of their . On the other hand, they expressed greater concern with respect to the engagement of their  in various high-risk behaviors. The findings are discussed in relation to the available literature and the collectivist background of Iranian society."
"Parenting Styles, Coparenting, and Early Child Adjustment in Separated Families with Child Physical Custody Processes Ongoing in Family Court",2021,"Co conflict and triangulation after separation or divorce are associated with poorer  adjustment when  gatekeeping and conflict occur. Fewer studies reported psychosocial adjustment of  under three. We explored the effects of authoritarian and permissive   and negative co on  adjustment in a purpose sample of 207 Portuguese newly separated/divorced s (50.2% mothers/49.8% fathers) with sole or joint (49.8%/50.2%) physical custody processes ongoing in court. s filled out the  Styles Questionnaire-s' report, the Co Questionnaire, and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire.  and co moderations path analysis to predict  adjustment were tested for two groups (2/3-year-old />3-year-old-) and showed a good fit, followed by multigroup path analysis with similarities. Findings suggest harsh  and interal conflict and triangulation as predictors for poor early  adjustment. The ongoing custody process could contribute to increased interal conflict. The families' unique functioning, , and conflict should be considered in young  custody decisions made in a particularly stressful period when the al responsibilities' process is still ongoing and conflict may increase to serve the best interest of the  and promote healthy development.

Looking into some of the risk factors of mental health: the mediating role of maladaptive schemas in mothers' parenting style and  anxiety disorders,2018,"Purpose - Anxiety disorders have a high prevalence in . Those  with anxious symptoms are more likely to experience significant disruption in their lives. This disruption can interrupt or even stop a  from participating in a variety of typical hood experiences. It is understood that genetic and environmental factors may cause this disorder. The purpose of this paper is to focus on environmental factors, namely, the mediating role of maladaptive schemes in mothers' -rearing and hood anxiety disorders. Design/methodology/approach - This  used correlation-modeling to assess the analysis. The sample included 326 students (aged 9-12 years old) and their mothers. The   (Baumrind, 1973), Early Maladaptive Schema (Rijkaboer and de Boo, 2010), and anxiety disorders (Muris et al., 2006) questionnaires were used in this . Findings - The  showed a relationship between   of mothers and hood anxiety disorders, a significant correlation between hood maladaptive schemas and hood anxiety disorders, a relation between -rearing  and hood maladaptive schemas, and finally a mediating role on hood anxiety disorders and mothers' -rearing  for some hood maladaptive schemas. Originality/value - This  contributes to the knowledge base of the importance of 's mental health. The paper analyzes the relationship of mothers'   and 's anxiety.

Parenting Style as a Context for Emotion Socialization,2009,"Research Findings: The purpose of this  was to examine   in the domain of emotion socialization through ing the relationships among  , emotion-related al practices, and al goals of Hong Kong-Chinese mothers. Data were collected from 189 Hong Kong-Chinese mothers of 6- to 8-year-old . Hong Kong-Chinese mothers reported that among authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive  , they adopted an authoritative  most often and an authoritarian  least often. They valued both relational and individualistic emotional competence of their  as al goals but regarded the former as more important than the latter. Structural equation modeling  indicated that al goals mediated the influences of   on al practices. Authoritative mothers who held individualistic emotional competence goals adopted different al practices (a coaching or an emotion-encouraging approach) from those who held relational emotional competence goals. When mothers adopted authoritarian  and endorsed relational emotional competence as a al goal, they responded to 's expression of emotions in a dismissing way. Practice or Policy:   play an overarching role in emotion socialization, influencing both al practices and goals. The  imply that school personnel, counselors, or social workers should take into account  , al goals, and cultural values of participants when they offer training programs to s."

The dynamics of parenting and early feeding - constructs and controversies: a viewpoint,2012,"There is increasing evidence that  and feeding interact to influence 's eating behaviour and weight status. Interpretation of existing  is complicated by the lack of consensus in the conceptualisation and measurement of both '' and 'feeding', particularly the distinction between '', 'dimensions' and 'practices'. In addition, the lack of validated tools to concurrently assess feeding practices in infancy limits the capacity to examine the relationships between  and feeding in infancy and their short-and long-term influence on weight status. In this paper, we provide an overview of the constructs examined in this emerging area of , highlight the conceptual, definitional and measurement challenges and propose a unifying model to aid design and the interpretation of intervention studies. Progress on these methodological issues will contribute to the robust evidence required to justify investment in interventions that focus on  and feeding in the context of  obesity prevention."
Perceived Parenting Styles and Adjustment during Emerging Adulthood: A Cross-National Perspective,2019,"The aim of the   is to determine whether the influence of   on 's wellbeing is sustained during emerging adulthood. This is a stage in which young people, despite feeling themselves to be adults, often remain in the family home and continue to be financially dependent on their s. Moreover, since s' beliefs, attitudes and behaviors are constructed and interpreted within their cultural milieu, the   aims to explore the situation in Spain (SP) and Portugal (PT). Those two Southern Europe countries are reative of what is known as the family welfare regime, in which the family acts as the main provider of care and security not only during hood, but  during emerging adulthood. Thus, the   examines, from a cross-cultural perspective, the relationship between perceived   and psychological adjustment among a sample of 1047 emerging adults from Spain and Portugal. The  reveal that the most beneficial  during this stage are the authoritative and permissive ones, with the authoritarian  being more closely related to psychological distress. The  highlights intercultural similarities and the positive role played by more symmetrical relationships in the adjustment of emerging adults in both countries."
Associations between Parenting Styles and Children's Fruit and Vegetable Intake,2015,"This  investigated associations between 's fruit and vegetable intake and their s'   (i.e., authoritative: high warmth-high control; authoritarian: low warmth-high control; permissive: high warmth-low control; and disengaged: low warmth-low control). Data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children K cohort, comprising approximately 5,000 , were used for analyses in wave 1 (4-5 years), wave 2 (6-7 years), and wave 3 (8-9 years). Fruit and vegetable intake patterns were extracted through exploratory factor analysis. Boys with authoritarian mothers were found less likely to consume fruits and vegetables at 6-9 years. Children of both genders with authoritative and permissive fathers, and girls with authoritative mothers at 4-5 years were found most likely to consume fruits and vegetables two and four years later. Exploring possible mechanisms underlying such associations may lead to interventions aimed at increasing 's consumption of fruits and vegetables."

Developing patterns of parenting in two cultural communities,2011,"This paper is aimed at analyzing verbal and nonverbal strategies in terms of body contact, face-to-face contact, and discourse  during the first three months of life in two cultural communities that have been characterized as embodying different cultural models of : German middle-class, and Nso farmer families. It can be demonstrated that the Nso mothers have significantly higher rates of body contact during the assessments of free-play interactions during the first 12 weeks than the German women. The German women on the other hand demonstrate the expected increase of face-to-face contact, whereas the Nso women demonstrate a significantly lower and stable pattern of face-to-face contact over the assessments. The German mothers use an agentic discourse , whereas the Nso mothers use a relational discourse . Moreover, body contact and a relational discourse  form one  strategy, whereas face-to-face contact and the agentic discourse  form another  strategy. The  demonstrate culture-specific  strategies that not only differ with respect to the amount of behaviors expressed, but  the developmental course of particular behaviors. It is  evident that socialization strategies are expressed in different behavioral channels.

MethodOne-hundred-and-eighteen overweight and obese  (10.40 1.35 years; 53% female; 52% Caucasian; BMI-z: 2.060.39) and their s (42.42 +/- 6.20 years; 91% female; 70% Caucasian; BMI: 31.74 +/- 6.96 kg/m(2)) were seen at a baseline assessment visit for a behavioral intervention that targeted overeating. The Eating Disorder Examination, adapted for  (ChEDE) was administered to assess for LOC eating. s completed the al Feeding Styles Questionnaire (PFSQ) and the Child Feeding Questionnaire (CFQ) to assess  feeding  and behaviors. Children  completed a self-report measure of general  (Child Report of  Behavior Inventory, CRPBI-30). ResultsForty-three  (36.40%) reported at least one LOC eating episode in the month prior to assessment. s who reported greater restriction and higher levels of pressure to eat were more likely to have  that reported LOC eating (ps<0.05). s who utilized more instrumental feeding and prompting/encouragement to eat techniques were less likely to have  that reported LOC eating (ps<0.05). Child-reported  behaviors were unrelated to  LOC eating (ps > 0.05). Discussion feeding  and behaviors appear to be differentially and uniquely related to LOC eating in treatment-seeking overweight and obese . Future  is needed to determine if implementing interventions that target  feeding behaviors may reduce LOC eating, prevent full-syndrome eating disorders, and reduce weight gain in youth.

"Effects of Life Stress, Social Support, and Cultural Norms on Parenting Styles Among Mainland Chinese, European Canadian, and Chinese Canadian Immigrant Mothers",2011,"The effects of life stress, social support, cultural beliefs, and social norms on   were examined for mainland Chinese (MC), Chinese Canadian (CC) and European Canadian (EC) mothers of 2- to 6-year-old . Authoritarian  increased with stress and traditional  beliefs and decreased with social support. EC mothers used less authoritarian  than either CC or MC mothers. This cultural difference was fully mediated by stress. For authoritative , there was a country of residence effect, which was not mediated; MCs were less authoritative than either CCs or ECs. All mothers were more authoritative when less stressed, when they had lower traditional rearing beliefs, and when they were more individualist. The  suggest the importance of the immediate social environment in influencing these cultural differences."
"Parental War Trauma and Child Distress: Mediation Role of Parenting Styles, Attachment and Family Functioning",2021,"The purpose of this  was to examine whether there was a direct effect of s' traumatic war experiences on the 's mental health, or whether the effect was achieved through the attachment, family dynamics and  . The sample consisted of 76 triads (fathers, mothers and ) from the territory of Kosovo and Metohija. The   show that the effect of the father's war trauma is mediated entirely by the variables Closeness/Dependence and Authority, while for the mother, it is the dimension Closeness/Dependence that achieves partial mediation. The  are discussed in context of trauma-focused and psychosocial approaches, and in the context of attachment theory."
Parenting styles and academic achievement in college students,2003,The purpose of this  was to investigate the relationship between   and college academic achievement. An ethnically diverse group of college students reported their GPA and responded to the  Style Index.   scores were unrelated to college GPA. Additional analyses of ethnic groups indicated differences in maternal involvement and strictness and relationship of these variables to GPA.
"Examining the relationship between adolescent sexual risk-taking and perceptions of monitoring, communication, and parenting styles",2003,"Purpose: To examine the relationship between adolescent sexual risk-taking and perception of al monitoring, frequency of -adolescent communication, and  . The influences of gender, age, and ethnicity are  of interest. Methods: Data were collected from 7th-12th grade students in six rural, ethnically diverse school located in adjacent counties in a Southeastern state. A 174-item instrument assessed adolescent perceptions, behaviors and attitudes. Youth who had engaged in sexual intercourse (n = 1160) were included in the analyses. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify  practices that predicted high versus low-risk sex (defined by number of partners and use of condoms). Variables included al monitoring, -adolescent communication,  ,  process interaction effects and interaction effects among these three  processes and gender, age and ethnicity. Analyses included frequencies, cross-tabulations and logistic regression. Results: al monitoring, al monitoring by -adolescent communication and   by ethnicity were significant predictors of sexual risk-taking. No gender or age interactions were noted. Conclusion: al monitoring, -adolescent communication and   are all important variables to consider when examining sexual risk-taking among adolescents. (C) Society for Adolescent Medicine, 2003."
"The Multiple Determinants of Maternal Parenting Stress 12 Months After Birth: The Contribution of Antenatal Attachment Style, Adverse Childhood Experiences, and Infant Temperament",2018," stress can influence caregiving behavior negatively, which in turn may harm 's development. Identifying precursors of  stress, preferably beginning during pregnancy and throughout the first year of life, is therefore important. The   aims to provide novel knowledge on this issue through a detailed examination of the association between maternal attachment  and later  stress. Moreover, we examine the role of several additional risk factors, specificially the mothers' own adverse hood experiences (ACE), as well as infants' temperamental characteristics. Data from a community based longitudinal  of 1,036 Norwegian mothers, collected during pregnancy and 12 months after birth, were used. Results showed that attachment  in pregnancy predicted  stress 1 year after birth. In addition, it was demonstrated that the mothers' own ACEs predicted postnatal  stress, and that attachment  operated as a mediator of this association. A significant association between perceived infant temperament and  stress was  found. The  illustrates the importance of understanding the multifactorial antecedents of  stress. The  may inform early intervention efforts aimed at supporting mothers and their partners in the potentially difficult transition period around birth."
Depression and parenting in youth with type 1 diabetes: Are general and diabetes-specific parenting behaviors associated with depressive symptoms over a 2-year period?,2019,"To examine cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of general   and diabetes-specific  behaviors with depression in youth with type 1 diabetes. Participants (n = 390) completed self-report measures of depression at baseline and 2-year follow-up, general   at baseline, and diabetes-specific  (conflict, task involvement, and collaborative involvement) at baseline and every 6 months. Logistic regression examined associations of  with depression at baseline and 2-year follow-up. A less authoritative  , lower  collaborative involvement, and greater diabetes-related conflict were associated with baseline depression in the model simultaneously including all  variables and covariates. Lower  collaborative involvement and higher diabetes-related conflict were associated with depression at 2-year follow-up, adjusting for baseline depression and covariates.  task involvement was not associated with depression at either time. Findings suggest a protective role of  in reducing the risk of depression in youth with type 1 diabetes."
PARENTING STYLE AND PEER ATTACHMENT AS PREDICTORS OF EMOTIONAL INSTABILITY IN CHILDREN,2017,"We analyzed the roles of   and peer attachment in predicting emotional instability in late hood and early adolescence. Effects were analyzed separately by gender. Children's personal variables analyzed were empathy, anger, and the mechanisms used to cope with anger (externalization and self-control). Participants were 316 girls and 294 boys (N = 610) aged from 9 to 12 years who were students at schools in Valencia, Spain. Main gender differences for each variable were examined using one-way ANOVAs. Results of 2 multiple linear regression analyses (1 for boys and 1 for girls) explained 50.9% and 35.5%, respectively, of variance in the students' emotional instability. Considering emotional and cognitive variables, the  for our participant group show that   and peer attachment were equally significant as predictors of emotional instability."
Parenting style associations with sensory threshold and behaviour: a prospective cohort study in term/preterm infants,2019,"Aim Early-life atypical sensory functioning and behavioural profiles are often associated with long-term developmental problems, especially in former preterm infants. We tested whether   is associated with atypical sensory threshold or behavioural outcomes in preterm and term infants assessed during early hood. Methods We prospectively evaluated   for a cohort of term and preterm infants who had previous assessments of sensory development and behaviour. We used standardised tools to evaluate  , sensory neurological threshold at one year, and internalising and externalising behavioural tendencies at two years. Covariates included gestational age, sex and maternal education. Results For the entire cohort (n = 82),  of more permissive s were 2.7 times more likely to demonstrate abnormal sensory neurological thresholds compared to  of s with less permissive  (CI: 1.4-4.9). More permissive  scores were  associated with 2.4 times increased internalising (CI: 1.3-4.2) and 3.0 times increased externalising (CI: 1.6-5.6) tendencies. In the preterm group only, higher authoritative  scores were associated with fewer behavioural problems. Conclusion Permissive  is associated with worse infant sensory and behavioural outcomes. Authoritative  is associated with fewer behavioural problems in preterm . Modification of   may improve sensory development and behavioural outcomes."
"Cross-sectional survey of daily junk food consumption, irregular eating, mental and physical health and parenting style of British secondary school ",2014,"Background Previous  has established that poor diets and eating patterns are associated with numerous adverse health outcomes. This  explored the relationships between two specific eating behaviours (daily junk food consumption and irregular eating) and self-reported physical and mental health of secondary school , and their association with perceived  and  health. Methods 10645 participants aged between 12 and 16 completed measures of junk food consumption, irregular eating, al , and mental and physical health through the use of an online survey implemented within 30 schools in a large British city. Results 2.9% of the sample reported never eating regularly and while 17.2% reported daily consumption of junk food. Young people who reported eating irregularly and consuming junk food daily were at a significantly greater risk of poorer mental (OR 5.41, 95% confidence interval 4.03-7.25 and 2.75, 95% confidence interval 1.99-3.78) and physical health (OR 4.56, 95% confidence interval 3.56-5.85 and 2.00, 95% confidence interval 1.63-2.47). Authoritative  was associated with healthier eating behaviours, and better mental and physical health in comparison to other  . Discussion A worrying proportion of secondary school  report unhealthy eating behaviours, particularly daily consumption of junk food, which may be associated with poorer mental and physical health.   may influence dietary habits. Interventions to improve diet may be more beneficial if  they address  strategies and issues related to mental and physical health."
Internet gaming disorder and its relationship with behavioral disorder and mother's parenting styles in primary school students according to gender in Iran,2021,"Background The problem of students' gaming addiction has been related to the individual student's characteristics and the influence of family environment. Researchers aimed to investigate if and how internet gaming disorder (IGD) of the elementary school boys and girls is related to behavioral disorder and their mother's   in Iran. Methods This is a descriptive correlational , involving 657 fifth and sixth-grade elementary school students in 2019. Researchers used a multistage stratified random sampling of students, their s and their teachers. Data were collected using internet gaming disorder questionnaire (IGD 20), Rutter teacher behavioral disorder questionnaire and Baumrind  Styles questionnaire (PSI). Obtained data were analyzed using SPSS version16 for descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation coefficient test. Results Findings showed that IGD prevalence was 5.9% among primary school students with significant relationship between IGD and behavioral disorder among all participants (r = 0.23, p = 0.04); although it was insignificant among boys (r = 0.13, p = 0.11). Also the relationship between IGD and mother's   was significant in the total sample (r = 0.12, p = 0.03), in particular for girls and their mothers (r = 0.2, p = 0.001). Conclusions The  of this  indicate the importance of family and al involvement in prevention and management of IGD chiefly among girls. Healthcare professionals will benefit from knowing the problematic consequences of online gaming among school-age  and try to promote safe and healthy online behavior supported by a supervised family environment."
Intergenerational continuities and discontinuities in parenting styles,2007,"In the   286 mothers and 274 fathers were surveyed regarding perceptions of their own  , and recollections of the   used by their s. Perceived intergenerational continuities were established for authoritarian and permissive  and, while same gender continuities were stronger than cross-gender continuities, significant independent cross-gender similarities were found between both fathers and daughters, and mothers and sons. Perceptions of intergenerational similarities were stronger between fathers and sons than mothers and daughters, emphasising fathers' important  role with their sons. Intergenerational discontinuities were found for authoritative , with  suggesting that the meaning and interpretation of authoritative  may vary between s and . Current s  perceived themselves to be less authoritarian and more authoritative and permissive than their own s, indicating that intergenerational transmission of  characteristics may be moderated by a sociocultural shift from more authoritarian to more democratic  rearing practices."

We  a series of studies. Study 1 investigated   and - communication  as cross-sectional predictors of dietary patterns in , and  2 as cross-sectional predictors of weight status in adolescents. Data were collected from s of 382  aged 2-12 in  1, and from s of 72 adolescent  aged 12-18 in  2. Controlling for confounders, laxness and over-reactivity predicted lower fruit/vegetable and higher non-core food consumption in  1. Incendiary -adolescent communication predicted higher adolescent body mass index in  2. These findings suggest that different -   are associated with diet and weight in  and adolescents. Improving ways in which s communicate with their  may be an important consideration in the development of effective -targeted treatment programmes for  diet quality and subsequent adolescent overweight/obesity."
Relationship of personal authoritarianism with parenting styles,2006,"This  investigated the relationship between the personality construct of right-wing authoritarianism and Bauntrind's 1971 proposed   of authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive . 68 youth ages 12-18 along with one of their s participated. The  rated both s on Buri's 1991 al Authority Questionnaire. One of the s responded to Altemeyer's Right-Wing Authoritarian Scale. People with higher scores on Altemeyer's scale were more likely to prefer the authoritarian   as their offspring reported (r =33). Permissive  correlated negatively with the measure of authoritarianism as a personality variable (r = -.56)."
Effect of Caregivers' Parenting Styles on the Emotional and Behavioral Problems of Left-Behind Children: The Parallel Mediating Role of Self-Control,2021,"Childhood is an important period of individual psychological development, and s' company and   are highly significant to 's personality cultivation and mental health. With the advancement of China's modernization and urbanization, left-behind  without their s' company have become a growing concern. Compared with  raised by their s, left-behind  are more likely to show social maladaptation and mental health problems. This  explored the mediating effects of left-behind 's dual mode of self-control between caregivers'   and emotional and behavioral problems (EBPs). In this , 469 left-behind  in senior classes of primary schools were investigated by adopting the caregivers'   questionnaire of left-behind , the dual-mode of self-control scale and the strengths and difficulties questionnaire. This  found that (1) the protective and risk factors for caregivers'   not only directly affected EBP, but  affected it through the mediating effect of the dual-mode of self-control, and (2) the mediating effect of the impulsive system was significantly greater than that of the control system. This  confirmed that caregivers'   had an important impact on left-behind 's psychological growth: positive   not only directly reduced the risk of EBP, but  indirectly improved left-behind 's mental health by promoting their level of self-control; negative   directly increased the risk of EBP and indirectly affected left-behind 's mental problems by enhancing their level of impulsiveness. These findings provide an important basis for reducing the risk of mental health problems and cultivating good personality qualities of left-behind ."
Parenting Styles and Family Contributors to the Development of Dietary Behaviors in Arab Children Ages 6-10 Years Old Living in the US,2020,"  and family contributors are the main determinants of obesity risk in . To date, no  has been reported on  /practices and family contributors to the development of dietary behaviors in Arab  living in the US. The objectives of this exploratory mixed-method  were to collect data on  feeding  (Caregiver's Feeding Style Questionnaire- CFSQ) of Arab mothers and family contributors (Family Nutrition Physical Activity- FNPA) to the development of dietary behaviors in their ; and to collect data on Arab mothers' challenges and strategies to promote healthier dietary behaviors in their . Although all Arab mothers (n=23) self-assessed that they were authoritative, only seven mothers were categorized as having an authoritative feeding  based on their CFSQ scores. The FNPA overall mean was 3.15, indicating less obesogenic family environment and behaviors. Across focus groups, barriers to desirable dietary intake included low vegetable intake and  being distracted by sweets, junk foods, and technology. All mothers wanted their  to have healthier dietary habits and used positive and negative approaches to achieve that. Positive approaches included no pressure to eat and providing healthier alternative foods. Negative approaches included pressuring the  to eat and rewarding with sweets and technology. In correlation analyses, the mother's BMI was significantly correlated with the 's BMI z-scores (r = 0.325, p = 0.005). This  can guide future efforts in assessing   and assessing the home environment regarding the dietary behaviors of Arab families."
The Role of Compassionate and Self-Image Goals in Predicting Psychological Controlling and Facilitative Parenting Styles,2019,"People enter into al roles with a range of different motivations for . To date, however, there is limited  assessing maternal motivations, concerns, and anxieties in their  . While some mothers are confident and  focused, others have concerns with performing  behaviors, and can be self-focused, shame prone, and self-judgmental. Two studies explored these two dimensions in relation to degree of controlling and facilitative   in the mothers of 3-9-year-old . In  one, 151 mothers took part in an online survey measuring these two dimensions using the compassionate goals and self-image goals scales (Crocker and Canevello, 2008), in relation to facilitative and controlling  . As predicted, after controlling for  behavior, al mental health, and al self-efficacy, self-focused and shame avoidant concerns were associated with greater psychologically controlling . In contrast a compassionate focused orientation was associated with greater facilitative . In  two, 198 mothers were randomly assigned to either compassion focused goals, self-image goals, or control condition, which was manipulated by varying the instructions provided to participants. Emotional responses (e.g., angry, sad, and shame) to difficult  scenarios did not differ depending on whether participants were prompted with compassionate goal, self-image goal, or control condition instructions. The findings from  1 demonstrate how goal motivation can influence  , with the  from  2 suggesting that instruction alone is insufficient to shift goal orientation."
The Role of Parenting Styles in the Relation Between Functions of Aggression and Internalizing Symptoms in a Child Psychiatric Inpatient Population,2016,"Psychiatric inpatient hospitalization is a costly intervention for youth. With rates of hospitalization rising, efforts to refine prevention and intervention are necessary. Aggression often precedes severe internalizing behaviors, and proactive and reactive functions of aggression are differentially associated with internalizing symptomatology. Thus, further understanding of the links between functions of aggression and internalizing symptomatology could aid in the improvement of interventions for hospitalized youth. The current  examined  , gender, and age as potential moderators of the relations between proactive and reactive aggression and internalizing symptoms. Participants included 392 , 6-12 years of age admitted consecutively to a psychiatric inpatient unit. Reactive aggression was uniquely associated with anxiety symptoms. However, proactive aggression was associated with internalizing problems only when specific   and demographic factors were . Although both proactive and reactive subtypes of aggression were associated with internalizing symptoms, differential associations were evident. Implications of findings are discussed."
Concurrent predictors of dysfunctional parenting and maternal confidence: implications for parenting interventions,2007,"Background The often intense nature of the conflict between s and their toddlers requires better understanding of what happens during this stage of development and how difficulties can be prevented from escalating in the future. Clarification of the nature of family and  factors related to toddler behaviour allows better capacity for intervention development and tailoring to individual families. Methods A total of 126 mothers of toddlers completed a self-report assessment battery, examining  behaviour,   and confidence, as well as broader family adjustment measures. Results The  found that maternal confidence and dysfunctional  were interrelated and were  predicted best by  variables, in contrast to socio-demographic and  variables. Maternal confidence  mediated the relationships between family income and toddler behaviour. Conclusions   and confidence are important modifiable factors to target in  interventions. The implications for the development, implementation and delivery of  interventions are discussed."
The relationship between self-actualization and parenting style,1997,"The   investigated the relation between self-actualization and  . Based on Abraham Maslow's (1954, 1970) theory of motivation and Diana Baumrind's (1971, 1973)  on  , it was predicted that high self-actualization scores would be positively associated with authoritative  and negatively associated with authoritarian . To test the hypotheses, college students were administered the Short Index of Self-Actualization (Jones & Crandall, 1986) and the al Authority Questionnaire (Buri, 1991). Correlational analyses offered support for the hypotheses and suggest that an authoritative   may facilitate self-actualization."

Effect of Positive Parenting Styles as Perceived by Middle School Students on Academic Achievement and the Mediation Effect of Self-Esteem and Academic Engagement,2021,"This  aimed to identify how positive   as perceived by middle school students affect their academic achievement and to assess the mediation effect of self-esteem and academic engagement. Data concerning 2590 middle school first graders were obtained from the South Korea Children and Youth Panel Survey 2018, and data analysis was undertaken using the SPSS21.0, AMOS22.0, and PROCESS macro programs. This  identified significantly positive effects of positive   and academic engagement on self-esteem, and of academic engagement on academic achievement. Furthermore, self-esteem and academic engagement had a mediating effect on the relation between positive   and academic achievement. Therefore, educators should develop programs that improve positive  , and specific programs for middle school students to enhance their academic engagement and self-esteem."
Parenting style and smoking-specific parenting practices as predictors of adolescent smoking onset,2005,"Objective To test whether   and smoking-specific  practices prospectively predicted adolescent smoking. Methods Three hundred eighty-two adolescents (age 10-17 years, initial nonsmokers, 98% non-Hispanic whites) and their s were interviewed, with smoking  assessed 1-2 years later. Results Adolescents from disengaged families (low acceptance and low behavioral control) were most likely to initiate smoking. Adolescents' reports of s' smoking-related discussion was related to lowered smoking risk for adolescents with nonsmoking s, but unrelated to smoking onset for adolescents with smoking s. Smoking-specific  practices did not account for the effects of general  . Conclusions Both   and smoking-specific  practices have unique effects on adolescent smoking, although effects were largely confined to adolescents' reports; and for smoking-specific  practices, effects were confined to families with nonsmoking s. Interventions that focus only on smoking-specific  practices may be insufficient to deter adolescent smoking."
Parenting and Adolescents' Self-esteem: The Portuguese Context,2013,"This  analyzes the relationships between   and adolescent's psychosocial adjustment (self-esteem) in the Portuguese culture. The sample was of 517 adolescents, 214 males (41.39%), and aged 11 to 18 years. The al Socialization Scale (ESPA29) was applied to measure   (authoritative, authoritarian, indulgent and neglectful), and the Multidimensional Self-Esteem Scale (AF5) to measure five dimensions of self-esteem: Academic, social, emotional, family and physics. Results from this  indicate that adolescents from indulgent families scored equal to or even better than those from authoritative families in some indicators of psychosocial adjustment. These  suggest that authoritative  is not associated with optimum self-esteem in Portugal. The  refers to the need for further , taking account new contexts and cultures."

Agreement on   between s and  was poor. Students perceived s as less authoritative, less permissive and more authoritarian than s considered themselves. High grades were associated with  and  perception of higher authoritativeness, lower permissiveness, and lower authoritarianism. Child tobacco and alcohol use was associated with  perception of lower authoritativeness, and higher permissiveness while  perception of   was not associated with  substance use. This  provides further evidence that   and adolescents' perceptions of them are associated with  achievement and substance use. While we cannot determine whether  or  perception of   is more accurate,  perception is more strongly associated with grades and substance use than is  perception.

Parenting Style and Religiosity as Predictors of Antisocial Behavior Among Nigerian Undergraduates,2018,"The relationship between  , religiosity and antisocial behavior (ASB) was investigated in this . Participants were 228 (120 males and 108 females) undergraduates. Participants' age ranged from 16 to 20 years (M = 18.9 years). They responded to the ASB scale, al authority questionnaire and centrality of religiosity scale. The  utilized a cross-sectional design and hierarchical regression was used for data analysis. Results showed that the model of the three dimensions of   (i.e., authoritarian, authoritative and permissive) predicted ASB and accounted for additional 11.2% variance in ASB over and above the control variables. However, only authoritarian (beta = 0.13, p = 0.043) and permissive (beta = 0.32, p < 0.001) statistically significantly predicted ASB. Religiosity accounted for 5.8% additional variance in ASB significantly predicting ASB (beta = 0.25, p < 0.001). Implications for social work among youths and counseling were discussed."

The interplay of parenting style and family rules about video games on subsequent fighting behavior,2021,"Due to ongoing concerns about adolescent interpersonal aggression and debates surrounding violent media, this  assesses the potential impacts of al mediation and   on mature video game play and fighting behaviors using a longitudinal, random-digit-dial survey of adolescents (N = 2722). By simultaneously considering fighting, M-rated video game play, al restrictions on media use,  , and important covariates, we aim to provide further nuance to existing work on risk and protective factors for interpersonal aggression. Our  show that al restriction has a significant, linear relationship with later fighting, whereby higher restrictions on a 's M-rated video game play predict decreases in reported fighting behavior. Authoritative , high in both warmth and supervisory attention,  relates to decreased levels of fighting compared to other .    moderated the effects of restriction, such that restriction was not equally predictive of fighting behavior across all  . However, the association between restriction and fighting was similar for highly demanding  , suggesting that authoritative  is not inherently superior to authoritarian. The effects of restriction were significant despite controlling for multiple covariates. al restriction of media use may be an effective strategy for s concerned about violent games. Given some limitations in our dataset, we call for continued  in this area."
ADOLESCENT ADJUSTMENT AND STEPPARENTING STYLES,1994,"A model of   was adapted for steps. Relationships between step  (Authoritarian, Authoritative, Supportive, and Disengaged) and adolescent adjustment were examined in a sample of 80 Caucasian residential stepfamilies.

Does self-esteem mediate the association between parenting styles and imposter feelings among female education students?,2020,"The  investigates the links between maternal and paternal   and the imposter syndrome among adult female students, while probing the meditative role played by self-esteem in this context. The sample comprised 182 female students (Mage = 27.85, SD = 7.25) who completed the al Bonding Instrument (PBI), the Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS), and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES). The  of the analyses of the regressions models using SEM revealed that al care is associated with students' lower imposter feelings via self-esteem, and paternal overprotection is associated with students' higher imposter feelings via self-esteem. Hence, al care and overprotection may be related to female students' imposter feelings since they increase and decrease (respectively) their self-esteem which, in turn, affects their imposter feelings. The current  is among the first to demonstrate the mediation role played by self-esteem in the association in question separately for mothers and fathers, which contributes to facilitating the understanding of the etiology mechanism of the imposter phenomenon."
The impact of maternal emotional intelligence and parenting style on  anxiety and behavior in the dental setting,2012,"Objective. The   investigated the correlations between maternal emotional intelligence (EQ),  ,  trait anxiety and  behavior in the dental setting. Study design. One-hundred seventeen , aged 4-6 years old (mean 5.24 years), and their mothers participated in the . The BarOn Emotional Quotient Inventory and Bumrind's   questionnaire were used to quantify maternal emotional intelligence and  . Children's anxiety and behavior was evaluated using the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) and Frankl behavior scale. Results. Significant correlation was found between maternal EQ and  behavior (r=0.330; p<0.01); but not between   and  behavior. There was no significant correlation between mother's total EQ and 's total anxiety; however, some subscales of EQ and anxiety showed significant correlations. There were significant correlations between authoritarian   and separation anxiety (r=0.186; p<0.05) as well as authoritative   and mother's EQ (r=0.286; p<0.01). There was no significant correlation between  anxiety and behavior (r = -0.81). Regression analysis revealed maternal EQ is effective in predicting  behavior (beta=0.340; p<0.01). Conclusion. This  provides preliminary evidence that the 's behavior in the dental setting is correlated to mother's emotional intelligence. Emotionally intelligent mothers were found to have predominantly authoritative  ."
"Attachment, parenting styles and bullying during pubertal years",2014,"Research that focuses on combining attachment,  , bullying and the reciprocal nature thereof in the -adolescent and peer relationships is limited. The bio-psychosocial changes that adolescents experience open up broader social realities and are perceived differently by s and adolescents. Attachment processes and   may elicit dissimilar perceptions. These processes are  associated with the multifaceted dynamics of bullying. The aim of the article is to advocate for  on the possible link between the implications of attachment,   and bullying. Exploring the association between attachment,   and bullying can deepen the understanding of the developmental challenges within the -adolescent relationship, add insight to the different perceptions of adolescents and s, and complement intervention programmes accordingly. Firstly, this article outlines bio-psychosocial changes in the pubertal years as related to the social realities of the adolescent. Secondly, a discussion on the concepts 'attachment', ' ', 'bullying', and the potential link between these concepts will follow. Thirdly, an outline of the clinical implications of the ap association between these concepts is given. The article concludes with recommendations that ers can consider while exploring the relationship between attachment,  , and bullying and the delineation thereof in the -adolescent relationship."
Confirmatory analysis of the Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ) short form in a portuguese sample,2018,"An important  field in family studies relates to the role  practices can have on several domains of 's development. Regarding to  , it was Baumrind's conceptualization that was responsible for a relevant  boost in this area. She proposed a model contemplating three different : authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive. The aim of our  was to examine the factor structure, internal consistency and others psychometric properties of the Portuguese version of the  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ). The participants were 424 s (mainly mothers, 81.2%) from Algarve (South of Portugal), that answered to PSDQ and a sociodemographic questionnaire. The instrument comprises 32 items: 12 questions regarding the authoritative , 15 questions regarding the authoritarian , and 5 questions regarding the permissive . Several competing models (i.e., one and three-factorial, and another where latent variables were organized in a 1st and 2nd order factors) were tested in regards to PSDQ factor structure using confirmatory factor analysis. A fourth model, contemplating inter-correlations between item 7 and 8 was  proposed, which showed adequate fit and internal consistency. These findings support the PSDQ original structure. Implications concerning the use and contributes to social and emotional ' adjustment are discussed."
Patterns of perceived parenting styles and associations with night eating syndrome symptoms and correlates among Chinese adolescents: a latent profile analysis,,"Purpose This paper aimed to explore the association between the patterns of perceived   and adolescents' night eating syndrome symptoms and correlates, including sleep quality, weight status, loss of control over eating, and psychological distress. Methods A sample of 455 Chinese adolescents (54.5% females, aged 12-15 years) were included in the current . Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) was adopted to examine the patterns of perceived  . The three-step approach was used to explore the differences in night eating syndrome symptoms and correlates between different profiles. Results A four-profile solution was found to fit the data best, and the four profiles were labeled as positive , negative , highly engaged , and lowly engaged . Subsequent analyses showed that adolescents across profiles exhibited significant differences in night eating syndrome symptoms and correlates. Specifically, adolescents in the positive  profile generally had the lowest scores in night eating and its correlates, while those in the negative  group reported the highest scores in night eating and its correlates. Conclusion Using a person-centered approach (i.e., LPA), the   identified four distinct patterns of perceived   in a sample of Chinese adolescents, with night eating and related symptomatology differing across each profile. Future interventions targeting night eating among adolescents may consider the potential influence from the patterns of perceived   to have a better intervention outcome."
"The Four Cs of Parenting: Applying Key Counseling Concepts for Raising Healthy Children Across Countries, Cultures, and Families",2018," is a challenge that faces every culture, creed, and nation. It carries a variety of assumptions, values, and perspectives that indicate how proper  should look. Much has been written with the hope of supporting positive  within the counseling and psychology literature, but putting these concepts into practice can prove challenging from the counseling office. This article explores common counseling concepts that promote healthy  through a careful review of the counseling literature regarding current practices and perspectives that exist internationally across countries, cultures, and families. Key findings in the literature highlight the significance of  , balanced agendas, autonomy, awareness, and cultural values. Understanding these concepts remains important for counselors to remain competent in supporting families, s, and  on an international level. Out of these findings, counselors are ed with a simple, practical format for s to enhance  experiences: the four Cs. Further detail about the four Cs outlines the significance of how s can support  with a foundation of care, consistency, choices, and consequences and how they can be practiced in the counseling office. Suggestions for ongoing studies  provide future pathways for evaluating the four Cs in future practice."
Less than optimal parenting strategies predict maternal low-level depression beyond that of  transgressions,2006,"The relationship between less than optimal  ,  transgressions and maternal depression were examined. It was predicted that variations in   would predict maternal depression over and above  transgressions. The   involved approximately 68 , their mothers and their preschool teachers. Participants included 36 male and 32 female  with a mean age of 50.76 months (standard deviation = 8.32), their mothers and their teachers. Mothers completed questionnaires on   and maternal depression, while teachers completed a questionnaire on 's social behaviours. A series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that less than optimal  (authoritarian   and emotion dismissing emotional ) predicted maternal depression over and above  transgressions (aggressive, asocial, excluding, anxious and hyperactive behaviours). Additional analyses revealed that mothers who engage in less than optimal  strategies are likely to experience augmented levels of depression. Overall mothers'   appear to be more salient in determining their negative moods than their 's transgressions.

Parenting and emotional well-being of adoptive school-aged : The mediating role of attachment,2017,"This  focuses on the processes of adoptive  that affect 's emotional well-being. It aims to analyze the role of 's attachment as a mediator of the relationship between both   and  stress and 's positive and negative affect in adoptive families of school-aged . The  included 322 Portuguese participants, divided into one group of adoptive s (n = 135) and one comparison group of non-adoptive s (n = 187); target- were aged between 6 and 12 years. Self report questionnaires were used to analyze the dimensions under  ( ,  stress, 's attachment and 's emotional well-being). After conducting a preliminary analysis to identify potential differences between the adoptive and the non-adoptive s, a mediation model was tested using the path analysis procedure. A baseline model was established, followed by a multi-group analysis in order to explore the model's invariance across the groups. Children's attachment mediated the relationship between  ( and stress) and 's positive and negative affect. The multi-group analysis revealed that, for the adoptive group, both secure and anxious/ambivalent attachment mediated the association between  stress and negative affect; for the non-adoptive group, secure attachment was found to mediate the link between emotional warmth and positive affect. For both groups, the relationship between  stress and positive affect was mediated by secure attachment. Results pointed to the relevance of 's attachment in the association of   and  stress with 's emotional well-being. Moreover, differences concerning the mediation model emerged across the two groups, revealing that 's negative outcomes were better explained in the adoptive group. The  reinforce the importance of supporting adoptive s after the adoption process."
"PATHOLOGICAL NARCISSISM, NEGATIVE PARENTING STYLES AND INTERPERSONAL FORGIVENESS AMONG PSYCHIATRIC OUTPATIENTS",2020,"Background: Pathological narcissism has previously been investigated with regard to negative  and interpersonal forgiveness, but inconsistent findings have been obtained in relation to its two phenotypic forms-grandiosity and vulnerability. Moreover, the role of negative  in the lack of forgiveness within narcissistic pathology has not been explored thus far. The aim of the current  was to investigate the complex relations among pathological narcissism, negative , and interpersonal forgiveness in psychiatric outpatients. Subjects and methods: A sample of 250 adult psychiatric outpatients (61% female; mean age 39.15 years) were enrolled in this . The participants filled out the Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI), the Tendency to Forgive Scale (TTF), the Measure of al Styles (MOPS), and the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales (DASS21). Results: Narcissistic grandiosity and narcissistic vulnerability were positively correlated with mothers' and fathers' negative , but this association was significantly stronger in the case of narcissistic vulnerability. Only narcissistic vulnerability was related to interpersonal forgiveness. In the mediation analysis, negative  was not directly related to interpersonal forgiveness, however, this association became significant after introducing narcissistic vulnerability. Narcissistic vulnerability served as a full mediator of the mothers' and fathers' negative -interpersonal forgiveness relationships. Conclusions: Narcissistic vulnerability seems to be more strongly related to negative  and interpersonal forgiveness than narcissistic grandiosity, while it  res one of the underlying mechanisms of the negative -interpersonal forgiveness relationship. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed in relation to pathological narcissism and lack of forgiveness."
Parenting style as a predictor of dietary score change in  from 4 to 14 years of age. Findings from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children,2021,"Objective: To examine associations between   and changes in dietary quality score across hood. Design: This longitudinal analysis included the 's frequency of consumption for twelve food and drink items reported by mothers of  (aged 4-8 years) and  (aged 10-14 years) during face-to-face interviews biennially. These items were combined into dietary scores based on the Australian Dietary Guidelines.   were classified at baseline as authoritative, authoritarian, permissive and disengaged. Multilevel modelling was used to examine changes in diet quality score over time by maternal  . Setting: The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. Participants: A total of 4282  aged 4 to 14 years. Results: Children's diet quality score declined over time between 4 and 14 years of age (beta = -0 center dot 10, 95 % CI (-0 center dot 11, -0 center dot 08)). There was strong evidence to suggest that change in diet quality differed dependent on baseline maternal  , although diet quality declined for all groups. Children with authoritative mothers had the greatest decline in diet quality score over time (beta = -0 center dot 13; 95 % CI (-0 center dot 18, -0 center dot 08)), while  with disengaged mothers had the lowest decline (beta = -0 center dot 03; 95 % CI (-0 center dot 07, 0 center dot 01)). However, it is important to note that  with authoritative mothers had a better dietary quality score than  of permissive or disengaged mothers for most of their hood. Conclusion: These findings question the previous assumptions that early exposure to an authoritative   has lasting positive effects on the dietary intake of ."
The influence of perceived parenting styles on socio-emotional development from pre-puberty into puberty,2018,"The relative impact of  on socio-emotional development of  has rarely been examined in a longitudinal context. This  examined the association between perceived   and socio-emotional functioning from hood to adolescence. We hypothesized that optimal  associated with improvement in socio-emotional functioning from hood into early adulthood, especially for those with more behavioral problems in hood. Children between ages 7 and 9 years were recruited for the Singapore Cohort Study of Risk Factors for Myopia (SCORM). Nine years later, 700 out of 1052 subjects were followed up (67%). During hood, s completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), while young adults completed the Youth Self-Report (YSR) and al Bonding Instrument (PBI). Perceived optimal al care ed in less internalizing and externalizing problems in early adulthood in comparison to non-optimal al care . Perceived optimal paternal , but not maternal , in interaction with hood externalizing problems predicted externalizing symptoms in early adulthood. No significant interactions were found between perceived   and internalizing problems. In conclusion, perceived al care associates with the quality of socio-emotional development, while optimal  by the father is especially important for  with more externalizing problems in hood."

With respect to al acceptance, a unique negative correlation with 's overall anxiety was found only for the father, while the mother's low acceptance was negatively correlated with social anxiety for highly anxious . Ultimately, it was found that  who perceived their s as authoritarian (highly controlling and strict disciplinarians) were significantly more anxious than the  who perceived their s as authoritative (encouraging independence while maintaining limits and behavioral control)."
Protective Factors in the Face of Political Violence: The Role of Caregiver Resilience and Parenting Styles in Palestine,2021,"As Palestinians living under occupation in the West Bank experience a variety of traumatic events,  identifying protective factors of 's mental health is essential. This  examined caregiver resilience and   as protective factors of the mental health of Palestinian  living in the West Bank.

Participants were 303 caregivers of primary school in the city of Nablus, Palestine. Caregivers completed measures of demographics, exposure to violence,  , and mental health of their . Results revealed that higher caregiver resilience was significantly associated with caregiver reports of better mental health in . Both permissive and authoritarian   were significantly associated with reports of poorer mental health in . The association between authoritative   and 's mental health was nonsignificant. Implications of these findings include adopting a multilevel approach to designing interventions through integrating the family in future preventative interventions for . This entails designing interventions to enhance resilience of caregivers and organizing psychoeducational programs to promote effective  practices."
"Beyond abuse: the association among parenting style, abdominal pain, and somatization in IBS patients",2004,"This  assessed the relative strength of the association between abuse, negative  , and somatization in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. Drawing from preclinical stress physiology and abuse  identifying the family social climate as a frequently stronger and independent determinant of long-term health effects than abuse-specific variables, we predicted that negative  behaviors would more strongly correlate with somatization than abuse. Subjects were 81 consecutively evaluated patients, who at baseline underwent psychological testing, measuring perceived al , abuse history, somatization, and pain. Although abuse correlated with maternal and paternal rejection, abuse was not associated with somatization. Higher levels of rejection and/or hostility among fathers (not mothers) were more strongly correlated with somatization than was abuse. Further, paternal  behaviors were more predictive of somatization than abuse, age, and gender. The lack of an association between abuse and somatization is discussed in light of limitations of biopsychosocial IBS models, whose strong focus on pathological stressors (e.g., abuse, trauma) as risk factors may overlook the importance of less extreme  variables in influencing somatic complaints. The relationship between  and somatization is discussed in the context of broader behavioral science  linking disruptions in the quality of  to dramatic and long-term changes in patterns of stress reactivity and brain abnormalities seen in IBS patients.

"The influence of maternal self-objectification, materialism and parenting style on potentially sexualized 'grown up' behaviours and appearance concerns in 5-8 year old girls",2016,"There is widespread concern about young girls displaying 'grown up' or sexualized behaviours, as well as experiencing body image and appearance concerns that were previously thought to only impact much older girls. The   examined the influence of three maternal attributes, self-objectification, materialism and  , on sexualized behaviours and appearance concerns in young girls. A sample of 252 Australian mothers of 5-8 year old girls reported on the behaviours and appearance concerns observed in their daughters and  completed measures of their own self-objectification, materialism and  . It was found that a significant proportion of young girls were engaging with 'teen' culture, using beauty products and expressing some degree of appearance concern. Maternal self-objectification was related to daughters' engagement in teen culture, use of beauty products and appearance concern. Maternal materialism was related to girls' engagement in teen culture and appearance concern, while an authoritative   was negatively related to girls' use of beauty products. The findings suggest that maternal self-objectification and materialism play a role in the body image and appearance concerns of young girls, and in so doing, identify these maternal attributes as novel potential targets for intervention.

Parenting Gifted Children Among Hong Kong Chinese Parents: What Differences Does Westernization Make?,2013,"Sixty-four s of Chinese gifted  who reported themselves to be traditional or Westernized s were compared on their endorsement of Chinese traditional and Western  values and beliefs as well as their   dimensions in terms of dominating control, guan, and warmth. Regardless of their degrees of Westernization, these s seemed to be more characterized by collectivistic than individualistic thinking approaches based on Nisbett's conceptualization. More Westernized s valued nonconformity significantly more than conformity, whereas less-Westernized s placed more emphasis on the importance of unconditional respect for elders and interdependence than on conditional respect and  independence. Regarding   and practices, though all s endorsed the practice of warmth significantly more, followed by guan, and significantly less dominating control, there was suggestive evidence that less-Westernized s practiced guan more than more-Westernized s. Implications of the findings for  gifted  are discussed."

School Disciplinary Style and Adolescent Health,2018,"Purpose:   is strongly associated with adolescent health. However, little is known about how school disciplinary  relates to health. We categorized adolescents' perceptions of their schools as authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, or neglectful, and test whether perceived school disciplinary  is associated with health. Methods: We analyze data from the RISE Up  (Reducing Health Inequities Through Social and Educational Change Follow-up), comprised of baseline (eighth grade) and 2-year follow-up surveys (10th grade) from 1,159 low-income minority adolescents in Los Angeles attending 157 schools. At 10th grade, students' ratings of school support and structure were used to categorize perceived school disciplinary  as authoritative (highest tertile for support and structure), authoritarian (low support, high structure), permissive (high support, low structure), neglectful (low on both dimensions), and average (middle tertile on either dimension). Mixed effects logistic regressions controlling for sociodemographic factors,  , grades, and baseline health tested whether school disciplinary  was associated with substance use, violence, bullying, and depression symptoms. Results: Risky behaviors varied by school disciplinary . After adjusting for covariates, compared with an average school disciplinary , a neglectful school was associated with higher odds of substance use (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.3, p < .001) and bullying (AOR 1.5, p = .02), a permissive school was associated with higher odds of depression symptoms (AOR 2.1, p = .04), and an authoritative school was associated with lower odds of substance use (AOR.6, p = .049), violence (AOR.6, p = .03), and bullying (AOR.5, p = .001).

Positive mother- interactions and parenting styles were associated with lower screen time in early hood,2020,"Aim This  examined long-term associations between mother- interactions and   and electronic screen time. Methods We studied 280 healthy  (53.2% girls) enrolled at a mean age of 36 +/- 0.4 months from February 2015 to September 2016. The  included retrospective data on 267  who had been recruited from medical facilities in Thailand at 6 months of age. Mother- interaction,   and screen time were assessed at various ages and path analyses were performed to elucidate the directionality and relationships between the variables. Results Increased mother- interaction at 18 months of age was positively associated with less screen time at 2 and 3 years of age. Likewise, nurturing authoritative  at 3 years of age was directly related to lower media exposure at 4 years. The total screen time at younger ages had positive direct relationships with relaxed permissive and strict authoritarian  , but negative direct relationships with nurturing authoritative  in subsequent years. Conclusion Early mother- interaction and nurturing authoritative  were associated with subsequent decreased screen time, while media exposure at the age of two was related to relaxed permissive and strict authoritarian  at 3 years of age."
"Associations between  emotional eating and general parenting style, feeding practices, and parent psychopathology",2014,"Emotional eating is the tendency to eat in response to negative emotions. Prior  has identified a relationship between   and  emotional eating, but this has not been examined in clinical samples. Furthermore, the relationship between specific  practices (e.g.,  feeding practices) and  emotional eating has not yet been investigated. The current  examined relationships between  emotional eating and both general and specific  constructs as well as maternal symptoms of depression and binge eating among a treatment-seeking sample of overweight . Participants included 106 mother  dyads who attended a baseline assessment for enrollment in a behavioral intervention for overeating. Ages of  ranged from 8 to 12 years old. Mothers completed self-report measures of their 's emotional eating behavior, their own feeding practices, and symptoms of depression and binge eating. Children completed a self-report measure of their mothers' general  . A stepwise regression analysis was conducted to identify the  variable that was most strongly related to  emotional eating, controlling for  age and gender. Emotional feeding behavior (i.e., a tendency to offer food to soothe a 's negative emotions) was the  factor most significantly related to  emotional eating. Findings suggest that emotional feeding practices in s may be related to emotional eating in . Treatment with overweight  who engage in emotional eating may be improved by targeting  feeding practices. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Impact of Behavioral Inhibition and Parenting Style on Internalizing and Externalizing Problems from Early Childhood through Adolescence,2009,"Behavioral inhibition (BI) is characterized by a pattern of extreme social reticence, risk for internalizing behavior problems, and possible protection against externalizing behavior problems.   may  contribute to these associations between BI and behavior problems (BP).

The Internet is both a great social and learning tool and full of potential dangers. Without proper al support and guidance, the chances of  being exposed to these dangers increase. Yet this can cause tension and distress between s and . The problem is aggravated because  tend to be more knowledgeable and skilled in the realm of computers than their s. The major purposes of the  were to show how various factors interact to affect s' sense of satisfaction about their attempts to help their  benefit from the Internet as well as reduce the risks to which their  are exposed. The major targets were families with  between the ages of 6 and 17. A household survey with a reative sample of 2,579 families was conducted in late 2009. Findings suggest that better-educated s, the adoption of an authoritative  , more active involvement in 's online activities, and more discussions of the online experiences are factors which are associated with more satisfactory  in influencing 's behavior."
The Mediator Role of Empathy Ability in the Relationship Between Parenting Style and Sense of Security in 3-6-Year-Old Chinese Children,,"While many factors can influence 's sense of security, little  has examined the role of empathy ability in the association between   and sense of security. The   aims to examine whether empathy ability mediates the relationship between   and sense of security among 3-6-year-old Chinese . The participants in this  included 242 3-6-year-old Chinese  with their s from three public kindergartens of China. The  Behavior Inventory (PBI), 3-6-year-old Children's Psychological Security Scale and Empathy Questionnaire were used to collect the data.

THE MEDIATING ROLE OF THE SCHEMES EARLY DESADAPTATIVOS BETWEEN THE STYLES PARENTALES AND THE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION,2017,"Several studies have identified a relationship between early   and the development of depression symptoms. The aim of this  was to analyze whether early maladaptive schemas (EMS) (Young, 1999) act as mediators between the domains of early al  proposed by Young (1999), and the development of symptoms of depression. A sample of 310 Uruguayan university students completed the questionnaire. The following assessment instruments were applied: the Young  Inventory (YPI; Young, 1999), the Schema Questionnaire-Short Form (SQ-SF; Young & Brown, 1994), and the Brief Symptom Check List (LSB-50; De Rivera & Abuin, 2012). The  of multiple regression analysis showed that for both s the EMS of abandonment, social isolation and insufficient self-control mediate the relationship between early perceived   (from the domains of Disconnection and rejection and Impaired autonomy) and symptoms of depression for both s. These  confirm the findings of previous  indicating that EDT mediates the relationship between al  and symptoms of depression."
"The relationship of recalled adverse parenting styles with maladaptive schemas, trait anger, and symptoms of depression and anxiety",2019,"Background: Young's contention that early maladaptive schemas mediate the relationship between adverse  and later emotional difficulties has been lrttle tested. Also, most relevant  focuses only on depression, and on maternal . Methods: One hundred and fifty-five non-clinical adults completed the Young  Inventory (YPI) regarding both their mothers and fathers, Young's Schema Questionnaire (YSQ), the State/Trait Anger Scale (STAS) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Results: Young's suggested 17-factor YPI structure was not supported. Rather, participants differentiated between recalled paternal and maternal , with rejecting and controlling components emerging for each . There was an indirect effect of rejecting fathering on symptoms of depression, via the social isolation schema, in support of Young's theory. However, despite some significant relationships between  and schemas, and schemas and emotions, most effects of  on emotions were direct. Rejecting fathering had a direct positive effect on trait anger, and controlling mothering on symptoms of depression and anxiety. Controlling fathering had a negative effect on anxiety symptoms. Limitations: The  was cross-sectional, limited to participants in a single city, and had a preponderance of female respondents. Conclusions: Most effects of adverse  seem to be direct rather than operating through schemas. Prevention through early  programs, and adult cognitive therapies that draw on a broad range of schemas, seem to be called for."
"Effectiveness of Group Positive Parenting Program (Triple P) in Changing Child Behavior, Parenting Style, and Parental Adjustment: An Intervention Study in Japan",2011,"The purpose of this  is to investigate the effectiveness of a group-based family intervention program known as the Group Positive  Program (Triple P), with families in Japan. Reductions in 's behavioral problems, changes in dysfunctional  practices, and affects on  adjustment were examined. Participants of both the intervention and control groups (N = 91 and N = 24, respectively) were recruited from mothers visiting health clinics in Kawasaki City, Kanagawa. Intervention and control groups were assessed in terms of  behavior (Strength and Difficulty Questionnaire, SDQ),   ( Scale, PS), and  adjustment (Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale, DASS; and  Experience Survey, PES), both pre- and postintervention. A repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance was used to determine the intervention's effects. The SDQ score for the conduct problems subscale indicated a significant intervention effect. In addition, the postintervention scores for all subscales of the PS, the DASS depression subscale and total scores, as well as ratings for perceived difficulty of  in the PES, were significantly reduced in the intervention group alone. The PES  revealed that confidence in  significantly increased only in the intervention group. Group Triple P is effective in decreasing  conduct problems, dysfunctional  practices, depression, anxiety, stress, and the perceived level of  difficulty, as well as in improving  confidence, among Japanese families."
Parenting Style and Youth Outcomes in the UK,2011,"We apply latent class analysis to data on -teenager interaction that was collected in the Youth Panel of the British Household Panel Survey. The three   that we identify-authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive-correspond quite closely to those proposed by  development psychologists. Multivariate analysis shows that   in contemporary UK is structured primarily by family structure and not by social class. There are consistent and strong associations between   and a wide range of youth outcomes, including subjective well-being and self-esteem, health and risky behaviour, and school  and enrolment."
"Parental feeding practices predict authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive parenting styles",2008,"Background Our goal was to identify how al feeding practices from the nutrition literature link to general   from the  development literature to understand how to target  practices to increase effectiveness of interventions. Stand-alone al feeding practices could be targeted independently. However, al feeding practices linked to   require interventions treating underlying family dynamics as a whole. Objective To predict   from feeding practices and to test three hypotheses: restriction and pressure to eat are positively related whereas responsibility, monitoring, modeling, and encouraging are negatively related to an authoritarian  ; responsibility, monitoring, modeling, and encouraging are positively related whereas restriction and pressure to eat are negatively related to an authoritative  ; a permissive   is negatively linked with all six feeding practices. Design Baseline data of a randomized-controlled intervention . Subjects/setting Two hundred thirty-nine s (93.5% mothers) of first-grade  (134 boys, 105 girls) enrolled in rural public schools. Measures al responses to encouraging and modeling questionnaires and the Child Feeding Questionnaire, as well as   measured by the  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire. Statistical analyses Correlation and regression analyses. Results Feeding practices explained 21%, 15%, and 8% of the variance in authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive , respectively. Restriction, pressure to eat, and monitoring (negative) significantly predicted an authoritarian  (Hypothesis 1); responsibility, restriction (negative), monitoring, and modeling predicted an authoritative  (Hypothesis 2); and modeling (negative) and restriction significantly predicted a permissive  (Hypothesis 3). Conclusions al feeding practices with young  predict general  . Interventions that fail to address underlying   are not likely to be successful."
Causal Evidence that Terrorism Salience Increases Authoritarian Parenting Practices,2010,The   experimentally investigated the impact of terrorism salience on authoritarian practices. It was found that terrorist threat cues (induced by reminders of terrorist incidents) had a significant impact upon both attitudes and behaviors regarding authoritarian  practices (Studies 1 and 2) as well as their actual occurrence in a real - playing interaction (Study 3). The implications of these findings for the social psychological perspective on threat and   are discussed.
Does physical fitness and parenting transformational style predict happiness and wellbeing and distress in adolescents?,2020,"There is a growing interest on the relationships between family functioning and behaviors that promote physical and psychological well-being in  and adolescents. The aim of the  was to assess the association of  transformational  with happiness, wellbeing and distress in adolescents, beyond of physical fitness influence, and independently of age and body mass index. Data were gathered among 868 Spanish school aged 12-16 years (M=14.07, SD=1.24) with a self-administered questionnaire and conducting physical fitness tests. The findings showed that age and the perception of a maternal and paternal transformational  predicted happiness, wellbeing and distress in adolescent girls. In boys, only the al transformational  acted as a significant predictor, independently of fitness level. Muscular strength contributed to explain the wellbeing in adolescent girls independently of transformational ; however, it did not happen in speed-agility and cardiorespiratory capacity. Findings suggest that promotion of  transformational  is beneficial to the psychological wellbeing, above all in younger adolescents. In girls, promotion of higher muscular strength could contribute to improve happiness and wellbeing independently of al transformational ."
"IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT, PARENTING STYLES, BODY UNEASINESS, AND DISGUST TOWARD FOOD. A PERSPECTIVE OF INTEGRATION AND RESEARCH",2017,"Objective: International literature has shown that a 's relational experiences from infancy to adolescence are crucial for the formation of personal and social identity. The reations and patterns of self and others might be risk factors for the dysfunctional perception of one's body, above all during adolescence. Likewise, certain defective   may prove crucial in the etiology of eating disorders. In particular, rejection and disgust for food may sometimes re the negative product of early dysfunctional experiences. The  paper investigates the relationship between identity development,  , perception of body image and refusal of specific foods in a group of adolescents and young adults. Method: The group of participants consists of 100 subjects, aged 18 to 32 (M = 21.56, SD = 2.67), of which 71 girls and 29 boys, who were recruited among university students in Sicily. Participants completed the following instruments: the Ego Identity Process Questionnaire, the al Bonding Instrument, the Body Uneasiness Test, and an ad hoc questionnaire to identify the food which individuals feel more disgust, and the family experiences associated with that specific food. Results and conclusions: Data show the predictive role of   on identity development. Furthermore, identity commitment seems to predict the perception of body image. The hypothesis about the influence of al control, especially the paternal one, on the intensity of food-specific disgust has  been confirmed. Results confirm the importance of relation between personal identity and family, the latter considered to be a predictor of personal and social development, not just a precursor of a high level of self-esteem, but  an expression of new tastes and food preferences."

The Relationship Between Parenting and the Economic Orientation and Behavior of Norwegian Adolescents,2013,"Little is known about the economic socialization of  and adolescents and the role of s in this process. The authors' purpose was to explore the role of  in the intergenerational transfer of economic orientation and economic behavior. More specifically, they studied the link between four  dimensions (al warmth-responsiveness, behavioral control, psychological control, autonomy granting), three   (authoritative, authoritarian, and neglectful) and adolescents' conscientiousness, future time perspective, and  hedonistic orientation. The authors  studied the relationships between these dispositions and the adolescents' spending preferences and ability to control spending. They used data collected from 14-16-year-olds (n = 597) and their s (n = 469) in Norway. Results showed that adolescents who perceived their s as psychologically controlling were less future oriented and conscientious, and were more  hedonistic oriented than others, while adolescents who perceived their s as responsive, autonomy granting, and controlling of behavior were more future orientated and conscientious than others. Adolescents' scores for conscientiousness and future orientation were negatively associated with preferences for spending and positively with the ability to control spending, while the opposite relationships were found with respect to a  hedonistic orientation. al  was  found to be important for the future educational plans of adolescents, and plans for higher education were more frequent among adolescents who characterized their s as authoritative than among those who perceived their s as neglectful. Implications of the findings for economic socialization are discussed."
"Parenting Style, Religiosity, Peers, and Adolescent Heavy Drinking",2010,"Objective: The purpose of this  was to examine whether authoritative, authoritarian, indulgent, and neglectful   were associated with adolescent alcohol use and heavy drinking, after controlling for peer use, religiosity, and other relevant variables. Method: Structural equation modeling was used to estimate direct and indirect associations of   with alcohol use and heavy drinking among 4,983 adolescents in Grades 7-12. Results: Adolescents whose s were authoritative were less likely to drink heavily than adolescents from the other three  , and they were less likely to have close friends who used alcohol. In addition, religiosity was negatively associated with heavy drinking after controlling for other relevant variables. Conclusions: Authoritative  appears to have both direct and indirect associations with the risk of heavy drinking among adolescents. Authoritative , where monitoring and support are above average, might help deter adolescents from heavy alcohol use, even when adolescents have friends who drink. In addition, the data suggest that the adolescent's choice of friends may be an intervening variable that helps explain the negative association between authoritative  and adolescent heavy drinking.

The existence of parenting styles in the owner-dog relationship,2018,"s interact with  following specific , known to influence  development. These  re variations in the dimensions of demandingness and responsiveness, ing in authoritarian, authoritative, permissive or uninvolved . Given the similarities in the  to  and owner to dog relationships, we determined the extent to which   exist in the owner to dog relationship using the existing  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire for the - relationship and an adapted version for dog owners. Items on the  of /dogs were rated for applicability on a five-point Likert scale by 518 Dutch dog owning s. Principal Component Analyses grouped  propensities into , with some marked differences between the findings for  and dogs. Dog-directed items grouped into an authoritarian-correction orientated , incorporating variation in demandingness and focussing on correcting a dog for behaviour verbally/physically, and in two  based on authoritative items. An authoritative-intrinsic value orientated  reflected variation in mainly responsiveness and oriented on the assumed needs and emotions of the animal. A second authoritative-item based , captured variations in demandingness and responsiveness. We labelled this  authoritative-training orientated, as it orientated on manners in teaching a dog how to behave in social situations. Thus, we defined dog-directed   and constructed a Dog-Directed  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire along the lines of the existing theoretical framework on  . We did not find a dog-directed   of being permissive or uninvolved, which we attribute to a  population of devoted dog owners and our findings should be interpreted with this specific  population in mind. We found evidence of dog-directed   and provide a fundament for determining their possible impact on the different aspects of a dog's life."
Maternal Scaffolding Behavior: Links With Parenting Style and Maternal Education,2012,"The purpose of this  was to specify the relationship between positive and harsh  and maternal scaffolding behavior. A 2nd aim was to disentangle the effects of maternal education and  quality, and a 3rd aim was to test whether  quality mediated the association between maternal education and scaffolding practices. We examined associations between positive and harsh  practices and contingent and noncontingent tutoring strategies. Ninety-six mother- dyads (49 boys, 47 girls) from working- and middle-class English families participated. Mothers reported on  quality at Time 1 when  were 5 years old and again approximately 5 years later at Time 2. Mother- pairs were observed working together on a block design task at Time 2, and interactions were coded for contingent (contingent shifting) and noncontingent (fixed failure feedback) dimensions of maternal scaffolding behavior. Positive and harsh  accounted for variance in contingent behavior over and above maternal education, whereas only harsh  accounted for unique variance in noncontingent scaffolding practices. Our findings provide new evidence for a more differentiated model of the relation between general  quality and specific scaffolding behaviors."
Worry and Permissive Parenting in Association with the Development of Internet Addiction in Children,2020,"The Internet has experienced a rapid increase in use globally. Specifically, more than 90% of Hong Kong's citizens use the Internet, and 70% of  in the age group of 6-17 years have daily access to it. However, internet addiction could pose serious social and health issues. Therefore, conducting  to investigate its causes and risk factors is fundamental. The current  examined the relationship between worry and Internet addiction among  in Hong Kong and investigated the moderating effect of the permissive   on such a relationship. The participants consisted of 227 fourth- and fifth-grade students (120 males, 52.9%) with a mean age of 9.55 (standard deviation (SD) = 0.58) in Hong Kong. Each participant was asked to complete the questionnaires, including the Internet Addiction Test for Internet addiction, the Penn State Worry Questionnaire for Children for worry, and the al Authority Questionnaire for the permissive  . The  indicated that worry was related to greater Internet addiction among . Furthermore, there was a moderating effect of the permissive   such that the positive association between worry and Internet addiction was stronger when the permissive   was higher. Our findings imply that   are influential in the prevention of Internet addiction."
"Cyberbullying in adolescents, the effect of internet parenting styles and family functioning",2018,"Objective: The aim of this  is to investigate the features of cyberbullying and the relationship between cyberbullying and internet al , and family characteristics. Methods: The participants were given Sociodemographic Data Form, Cyber Bully/Victim Scale, Internet  Styles Scale and the Family Evaluation Scale. The Sociodemographic Data Form includes questions about marital status, health status, educational level of s, disciplinary punishment, smoking-alcohol consumptions, internet-mobile phone usage and methods of coping with cyberbullying. The cyberbully/victim scale allows determining whether they are subjected to a cyberbullying and/or victimization and if so, what kind of a bullying they are exposed or applied. The Internet  Scale allows, such as laissez-faire/authoritarian/authoritative/permissive attitudes, to assess how s approach to adolescents internet usage. Family Evaluation Scale enables assessment of successes and failures of family functions in problem solving, communication, roles, emotional reaction capability, capacity of showing interest, behavior control, general functions areas. 386 adolescents, between the ages of 12-14 (6th-8th grades) were taken to . Results: It is determined that 153 of the adolescents were cyber victims, 93 of the adolescents were bullies, and 78 of the adolescents were bullies and victims. Cyberbullying and/or victimization is found significantly related to disciplinary punishment, threatening/to be threatened, involving in a fight, smoking-alcohol consumption, internet/mobile phone usage, and psychiatric treatment. The attitudes of families towards internet usage of adolescents and family functioning are  found related to cyberbullying and/or victimization. Conclusion: It is observed that there is a small number of studies examining cyberbullying and internet   and family functioning in the literature of cyberbullying. However, it is thought that the right attitudes of adolescents to the usage of the internet and positive relationships with adolescents can prevent or be effective in coping with cyberbullying."
Children's negative emotionality moderates influence of parenting styles on preschool classroom adjustment,2015,"This investigation utilized a subsample from the Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Project (N = 1101) to examine how profiles of maternal behaviors at 36-months were associated with 's classroom aggression and teacher  relationship quality in pre-kindergarten. Based upon observed behaviors, we identified three distinct profiles of  categorized as sensitive, harsh, and detached. Results revealed significant main effects of the detached  profile on both dimensions of 's classroom functioning in pre-kindergarten. These main effects were not moderated by  sex. The main effects were moderated by  negative emotionality, suggesting a promotive effect of sensitive  for  with low negative emotionality. Children exposed to detached  had the poorest teacher  relationships, regardless of emotionality. These findings demonstrate through use of a person-centered approach how  behaviors relate to contextual risks and characteristics, and to 's later relationships with teachers and classmates in pre-kindergarten.

Transition in Cigarette Smoking Stages and its Relation with Parenting Styles of Parents among Iranian High School Students: A Longitudinal Study,2020,"Background: Smoking is increasing among adolescents, and family is a factor influencing it. The   aimed to examine the relationship between transition in smoking stages and   of s of adolescents. Materials and Methods: This was a longitudinal  in which 3968 high school students in Tabriz, Iran, were examined from November 2017 to June 2018. Sampling was multi-stage, with proportional and random clusters. A questionnaire containing demographic information and potential confounders were filled in by students, and the  Style Inventory was completed by s only in the first stage. Moreover, students twice (in the beginning of the  and six months later) completed a valid algorithm of stages of cigarette smoking. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: After the six-month interval, 429 students (11.7%) with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) (10.68 - 12.76) progressed through the stages of smoking. By controlling potential confounding variables, the father's permissive   compared to the authoritative  increases the odds of progress through the stages of smoking by almost five times (OR=5.06, 95% CI: 2.58 - 9.93), and the father's authoritarian   compared to the authoritative  increases the odds of progress through the stages of smoking by almost four times (OR=4.01, 95% CI: 2.17 - 7.40). Conclusion: Inefficient   are an important risk factor for progress through the stages of cigarette smoking in adolescents. Desirable relationships between s and  as well as s' awareness of   may prevent smoking in adolescents."
Parenting style as a mediator between 's negative emotionality and problematic behavior in early hood,2008,"Negative emotionality is considered to be the core of the difficult temperament concept (J. E. Bates, 1989; R. L. Shiner, 1998). In this correlational Study, the authors examined whether the relations between 's negative emotionality and problematic behavior (internalizing and externalizing) were partially mediated by   (authoritative and authoritarian) in a community sample of 196 3-year-old  and their mothers. The authors assessed maternal perception of  negative emotionality using the Children's Behavior Questionnaire (M. K. Rothbart, S. A. Ahadi, K. L. Hershey, & P. Fisher, 2001) and assessed problematic  behavior by means of maternal report using the Child Behavior Checklist (T. M. Achenbach, 1992). The  showed that the relations between  negative emotionality and internalizing and externalizing behaviors were partially mediated by mothers' authoritative  . Moreover, when the authors used confirmatory factor analysis to decontaminate possible overlap in item content between measures assessing temperament and problematic behavior, the association between negative emotionality and internalizing behavior was fully mediated by authoritative ."
Maternal Anxiety and Separation Anxiety in Children Aged Between 3 and 6 Years: The Mediating Role of Parenting Style,2018,"Objective: Maternal anxiety is known to be associated with hood separation anxiety. However, there is little  on the mediating factors of this relationship, despite the possible consequences separation anxiety might have for 's development and autonomy. The objective of this  was to analyze the possible mediating effects of 4   (overprotective, assertive, punitive, and inhibited) on the relationship between maternal anxiety and  separation anxiety. Methods: Participants were 235 mothers with  aged 3 to 6 years, recruited from 6 preschools in the southeast of Spain. Maternal trait anxiety, maternal  , and  separation anxiety were evaluated. Results: A parallel multiple-mediation analysis revealed that the overprotective   was a significant mediator of the relationship between maternal trait anxiety and  separation anxiety. In addition, mothers with higher trait anxiety scores exhibited a greater likelihood of using an overprotective, punitive, or less assertive  . Younger mothers were more likely to use an overprotective  , and compared with girls, boys were more exposed to the assertive . Conclusion: This  provides initial evidence that   acts as a mediator of the relationship between maternal anxiety and  separation anxiety."
Elucidating the etiology and nature of beliefs about parenting styles,2000,"This  was designed to investigate relationships among self-reported and spouse-reported beliefs about  , the characteristics of the individuals manifesting these , and the contextual characteristics of . Demographic characteristics, life circumstances, family functioning, personality traits, ability indices, and - indicators were collected from a sample of 452 women and 293 men, all of whom were raising adolescents in contemporary Russia. Of the families studied, 275 were intact (i.e. consisted of married and cohabiting couples). It was found that individual characteristics and contextual characteristics (e.g. family functioning) together predicted about 20% of the variance in reported beliefs about al  of responsiveness and demandingness. Moreover, these variables discriminated about 65% of the s reporting indulging, neglectful, authoritarian or authoritative beliefs about . The percentage of explained variance doubled when beliefs about   of partners were placed in the model. Thus, in attempts to understand the etiology of s' beliefs about  , more attention should be given to beliefs about   of their spouses.

Examining Gender-Specific Modeling in the Intergenerational Transmission of Parenting Style and Physical Child Abuse Risk,,"Although  demonstrates intergenerational transmission of  attitudes and  abuse risk, greater clarity on the potential mechanisms in this process is needed. Role-specific modeling refers to an individual's tendency to adopt the attitudes or behaviors of those in roles they themselves expect to ultimately occupy. How gender influences role-specific modeling-namely, how emerging adults align with same-gender s-has not been well examined in this intergenerational transmission. The current  used a multi-informant approach to examine the associations between emerging adults'  abuse potential,   history, and expected   and their s'  abuse potential and  . Further, whether maternal and paternal   were concordant versus discordant was  considered in relation to emerging adults'  abuse potential. In a multi-phase , the first phase included 867 emerging adults; the second phase included a sample of these emerging adults' mothers (n = 237) and fathers (n = 176). Both mothers' and fathers'   and abuse potential related to emerging adults' abuse potential, with more pronounced effects for daughters. Results indicated gender-specific modeling was not ap in emerging adults' abuse risk, alternatively suggesting potential cross-gender effects. Concordance in both s adopting an authoritative   ed in emerging adults' significantly lower  abuse risk compared to those with any authoritarian  history.

Relations of Collectivism Socialization Goals and Training Beliefs to Chinese Parenting,2019," behaviors may be influenced by multiple factors, including al values, beliefs, socialization goals, and 's characteristics (e.g., personality, age). This  examined relations between Chinese mothers' collectivism socialization goals and training beliefs and their   and behaviors with their  (youth ages 9-17 years), using structural equation modeling (SEM). In addition, in an exploratory manner, the associations between youth's age and mothers'   and behaviors were  explored. In all, 652 youth (female 46.2% and male 52.9%) and their mothers were recruited from urban areas in mainland China. Youth answered questionnaires about their mothers'  (i.e.,  , behavioral control, and psychological control), and mothers reported their endorsement of collectivism socialization goals and training beliefs. The findings suggest that Chinese mothers' endorsement of collectivism socialization goals was positively associated with their authoritarian and authoritative   and behavioral control, but negatively associated with psychological control. Chinese mothers' training beliefs were negatively associated with the use of behavioral control. Youth age was negatively associated with Chinese mothers' use of authoritative and authoritarian   and behavioral control. Therefore, the current  suggests that mothers' collectivism socialization goals and training beliefs and youth age may have an impact on   and  behaviors in mainland Chinese mothers."
Temperament and Parenting Styles in Early Childhood Differentially Influence Neural Response to Peer Evaluation in Adolescence,2015,"Behavioral inhibition (BI) is a temperament characterized by social reticence and withdrawal from unfamiliar or novel contexts and conveys risk for social anxiety disorder. Developmental outcomes associated with this temperament can be influenced by 's caregiving context. The convergence of a 's temperamental disposition and rearing environment is ultimately expressed at both the behavioral and neural levels in emotional and cognitive response patterns to social challenges. The   used functional neuroimaging to assess the moderating effects of different   on neural response to peer rejection in two groups of adolescents characterized by their early hood temperament (M (age) = 17.89 years, N = 39, 17 males, 22 females; 18 with BI; 21 without BI). The moderating effects of authoritarian and authoritative   were examined in three brain regions linked with social anxiety: ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), striatum, and amygdala. In youth characterized with BI in hood, but not in those without BI, diminished responses to peer rejection in vlPFC were associated with higher levels of authoritarian . In contrast, all youth showed decreased caudate response to peer rejection at higher levels of authoritative . These findings indicate that BI in early life relates to greater neurobiological sensitivity to variance in  , particularly harsh , in late adolescence. These  are discussed in relation to biopsychosocial models of development."
Relations between Childraising Styles and Aggressiveness in Adolescents,2014,"Introduction. Physical and aggressive behavior which  and adolescents show toward peers is associated to  . The aim of this  was to examine the relation between perceived   (from mothers and fathers) and the level of physical and verbal aggressive behavior, anger and hostility showed towards the peers. Method. Thirty hundred and seventy-one students, aged 12 -16 years old, answered to several self-report measures: Escala de Afecto (EA) and Escala de Normas y Exigencias (ENE) as well as, Aggressive Questionnaire. Results. Analysis of variance revealed that adolescents whose s showed an authoritative   obtained lower scores in physical and verbal aggressive behaviors than peers whose s showed an authoritarian . Moreover, boys scored higher than girls in physical aggressive behavior. Discussion and Conclusion. A perceived authoritarian   was associated with a higher aggressive behavior. Low levels of affectio and high levels of control, which define an authoritarian , were associated with higher levels of aggressive behavior, which could negatively affect the behavior exhibited by adolescents in different context as peer interactions."
"Characteristics of positive-interaction parenting style among primiparous teenage, optimal age, and advanced age mothers in Canada",2018,"Background: Positive-interaction  early in hood is encouraged due to its association with behavioural development later in life. The objective of this  was to examine if the level of positive-interaction   differs among teen, optimal age, and advanced age mothers in Canada, and to identify the characteristics associated with positive-interaction   separately for each age group. Methods: This was a cross-sectional secondary analysis of the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth. First-time mothers with  0-23 months were grouped into: teen (15-19 years, N = 53,409), optimal age (20-34 years, N = 790,960), and advanced age (35 years and older, N = 106,536). The outcome was positive-interaction   ( Practices Scale); maternal socio-demographics, health, social, and  characteristics were considered for backward stepwise multiple linear regression modeling, stratified for each of the age groups. Results: Teen, optimal age, and advanced age mothers reported similar levels of positive-interaction  . Covariates differed across the three age groups. Among optimal age mothers, being an ever-landed immigrant, care use, and being devoted to religion were found to decrease positive-interaction  , whereas, higher education was found to increase positive-interaction  . Teen mothers were not found to have any characteristics uniquely associated with positive-interaction . Among advanced age mothers, social support was uniquely associated with an increase in positive-interaction . Very good/excellent health was found to be positively associated with  in teens but negatively associated with  in advanced age mothers. Conclusion: Characteristics associated with positive-interaction  varied among the three age groups. Findings may have public health implications through information dissemination to first-time mothers, clinicians, ers, and public health facilities."

The Mediating Role of Early Maladaptive Schemas and Emotion Regulation Difficulties in the Relationship between Perceived Parenting Styles and Disordered Eating Attitudes,2017,"In this  it was aimed to investigate the relationship between disordered eating attitude and early maladaptive schemas, emotion regulation difficulties, and perceived   in young women. Accordingly, the main aim of this  is to evaluate the mediation effect of early maladaptive schemas and emotion regulation difficulties in the relationship between the perceived   and eating attitudes. The sample of this  consists of 773 female university students aged between 17-35. Eating Attitudes-Test (EAT-40), Young Schema Questionnaire- Short Form 3 (YSQ-SF3), Young  Inventory (YPI) and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) were used. First, the sample was classified into two groups as high risk group for developing eating disorder (n = 92) and low risk group for developing eating disorder (ri = 80) according to the scores obtained from Eating Attitude Test. Analysis has shown that the high risk group perceive both their mother and father negatively, possess more severe early maladaptive schemas and face more difficulties in the emotion regulation except for awareness sub-dimension than the low risk group. In addition, with the whole sample (N = 773), it has been found that the emotional deprivition, self-sacrifice, unrelenting standards (high standards) schemas of early maladaptive schemas and difficulties of emotion regulation total score have served as disordered eating attitude predictors. Besides, it is understood from the analysis that these variables have a mediating role in the relationship between negative perceived maternal  and eating attitudes. It is considered that these findings will be a guide to prepare intervention studies."

The participants are 279  (154 boys and 125 girls). To measure reactive and proactive aggression,  completed the reactive and proactive questionnaire (RPQ). Child temperament and   were evaluated by both s using the temperament in middle hood questionnaire (TMCQ) and the   and dimensions questionnaire (PSDQ). The  revealed that boys with high surgency levels and authoritarian fathers displayed more reactive aggression, whereas behaviorally inhibited boys with mothers who scored low for authoritarian  displayed less reactive aggression. Finally, girls with high levels of effortful control and mothers who scored low for authoritative  displayed more proactive aggression.

The impact of family socioeconomic status and parenting styles on 's academic trajectories: A longitudinal study comparing migrant and urban  in China,2021,"The positive development of migrant  in China is hampered due to their unequal accessibility to quality urban education resources. This  aimed at exploring the developmental trajectories of migrant and urban 's literacy and mathematics performance, as well as the impact of family socioeconomic status (SES) and  , including the mediating effect of  , by comparing migrant  with their urban counterparts. Growth mixture modeling identified distinguishable trajectories of mathematics development for migrant  (i.e., falling behind and keeping pace groups) and urban  (i.e., catching up and keeping pace groups), as well as distinguishable trajectories of literacy development for migrant  (i.e., jumpstarting and keeping pace groups) and urban  (falling behind and steadily progressing groups). Multinomial logistic regression analyses further clarified that authoritative  increased the likelihood of favorable trajectories of migrant 's mathematics development and urban 's literacy and mathematics development. Family SES enhanced migrant 's mathematics development. Family SES contributed to urban 's literacy development through authoritative , yet such a mediating effect was not observed for migrant . This  highlights the importance of focusing on distinct trajectories of migrant and urban 's literacy and mathematics in improving their school achievement."
An Exploration of Parenting Behaviours and Attitudes During Early Infancy: Association with Maternal and Infant Characteristics,2013,"The importance of warm and democratic   for optimal social, emotional and cognitive outcomes in  over the age of five is well established. However, there is a dearth of literature exploring variations in   during infancy, despite many popular  books aimed at this period. The primary aim of this  was to explore   in infancy and their association with infant and maternal characteristics. Five hundred and eight mothers of infants under 12months of age completed a 36-item questionnaire examining cognitive and behavioural aspects of early  (Infancy  Styles Questionnaire). Items for the questionnaire were generated from popular culture early  books, and those raised in discussion with mothers. The underlying factor structure of the Infancy  Styles Questionnaire revealed five independent factors: discipline, routine, anxiety, nurturance and involvement, which mapped onto existing concepts of warmth/nurturance and control for  older , with additional constructs pertaining to the challenge of caring for young infants. Early   was associated with maternal age and education, and infant birth weight, gender and age. The findings are discussed in relation to the   literature for older  and the attachment literature.

How do parenting concepts vary within and between the families?,2009,"How do  concepts vary within and between the families? The   regards  as a complex family process by considering three concepts of : , differential treatment and co consistency. A main question was addressed: whether and how these  concepts vary within the families towards siblings or between the two s, and between the families according to the 's, the s and the family's characteristics? The  concepts were computed from the EPEP questionnaire (Meunier & Roskam, 2007) in a sample of 101 non-divorced families: 101 mothers and 101 fathers of two siblings from 6- to 12-years-old. The  concepts were found to vary within the families towards two siblings and between the mother and the father. They were  found to vary between the families according to the 's age and personality traits as well as a function of the 's educational level and the number of siblings."
The impact of maternal and paternal parenting styles and parental involvement on Chinese adolescents' academic engagement and burnout,,"Academic burnout and engagement are important indicators of students' school success. This short-term longitudinal  examined whether   and al involvement ( report, collected at Time 1) predicted adolescent-reported academic burnout and engagement (collected at Time 3, two months later) directly or indirectly via adolescents' perceived al support (collected at Time 2, one month later). A total of 285 Chinese high school students (M = 15.93 years, SD = 1.06 years, 51.9% boys) and their fathers and mothers participated in the survey over three time points (one month apart for each data collection). Path analysis  indicated that authoritative  predicted less academic burnout in adolescents. Perceived paternal support mediated the relations between paternal authoritative  and adolescents' academic engagement. s' knowledge and skills involvement positively predicted adolescents' perceived support, which in turn, predicted more academic engagement. However, father's time and energy involvement predicted lower perceived paternal support, especially for boys. Moreover, multi-group analysis suggested that fathers and mothers influenced boys' and girls' academic burnout and engagement differently. In conclusion, it is important to consider adolescents' perception of al support, their developmental needs, and gender roles in Chinese families in order to increase adolescents' academic engagement and decrease students' academic burnout."
Parental socialization styles in a sample of Chilean adolescents,2020,"The  of al socialization (ESP) have been the subject of different studies in the social sciences and especially in psychology due to the consequences that  can  in the life of a person. The literature has evidence that  may vary depending on contextual variables such as culture, beliefs, education, family types or socioeconomic levels (NSE). The main objective of the  was to describe the ESP as an approximation to the form of  used by s, mothers or caregivers (PMC) in Chile. A non-experimental-descriptive  was conducted with a sample of 875 adolescents aged between 11 and 18 years (M = 14.12, SD = 1.82), 51% males, of four NSE (low, medium low, medium and medium high) from seven cities in Chile. A sociodemographic survey was used to characterize the sample, and the Styles of al Socialization in Adolescence Questionnaire (ESPA29). The  show differences in the configuration of ESP between PMC. In mothers, the configuration of ESP (in descending order) was: democratic, indulgent, negligent and authoritarian and in s: indulgent, negligent, democratic and authoritarian, there are differences according to NSE.

Autonomous and Controlled Motivation for Parenting: Associations with Parent and Child Outcomes,2015,"The  investigation examined motivation for  and some of its correlates in s and . The data came from samples of 151 first-time mothers of infants, 153 mothers of middle school , and 260 mothers and fathers of high school . s provided self-report data about their motivation in their  role as well as reports of role satisfaction, al competence,  temperament, and  . Using three samples, factor analyses confirmed the distinction between autonomous and controlled forms of  motivation. Autonomous motivation refers to investing in the  role because it is interesting and meaningful whereas controlled motivation refers to investment based on external or internal pressures. Results showed that autonomous motivation was associated concurrently with  satisfaction and competence as well as with authoritative and autonomy-supportive  . Child temperament was unrelated to  motivation, but mothers reported greater autonomous motivation for girls than boys and for younger  rather than older . Autonomous  motivation was associated with  reporting autonomy supportive  and high levels of well-being. A prospective analysis showed that controlled  motivation in first time mothers was associated with reductions in  satisfaction as infants became toddlers. A similar analysis showed that autonomous  motivation was associated with  developing fewer behavior problems whereas controlled motivation was associated with  developing more behavioral problems. The  findings highlight the heuristic value of assessing why s invest themselves in the  role."

Defining Tiger Parenting in Chinese Americans,2013,"Tiger'' , as described by Amy Chua [2011], has instigated scholarly discourse on this phenomenon and its possible effects on families. Our eight-year longitudinal , published in the Asian American Journal of Psychology [Kim, Wang, Orozco-Lapray, Shen, & Murtuza, 2013b], demonstrates that tiger  is not a common  profile in a sample of 444 Chinese American families. Tiger   does not relate to superior academic performance in . In fact, the best developmental outcomes were found among  of supportive s. We examine the complexities around defining tiger  by reviewing classical literature on   and scholarship on Asian American , along with Amy Chua's own description of her  method, to develop, define, and categorize variability in  in a sample of Chinese American families.

Adolescents' perceptions of primary caregivers and cognitive style: The roles of attachment security and gender,2005,"Prior  has established a link between negative early - relationships and cognitive  related to risk for depression. In attempting to explain this association, several theorists have proposed that attachment insecurity may play a key mediating role. The   examined the relationships between adolescents' perceptions of their primary caregivers and negative cognitive  (i.e., low self-esteem, dysfunctional attitudes, and a negative attributional ), and tested whether these relations were mediated by attachment insecurity. Results from 134 high-school students suggested that adverse  tends to have a more negative effect on cognitive  among girls compared to boys and that the association between  and cognitive  is largely mediated by attachment insecurity. Adolescents who perceive their s as critical and perfectionistic tend to report insecure attachment  characterized by difficulties getting close to others and fears about abandonment, and in turn, these dimensions of attachment insecurity appear to contribute to low self-esteem, dysfunctional attitudes and a negative attributional ."

One hundred women (aged 18-88) participated in the  and 39 matched mother-daughter dyads were analysed. The Young Schema Questionnaire, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale, al Bonding Instrument and al Authority Questionnaire were used to assess individual schemas,   from the daughters' perspective, and depression as a mood-state control variable. Mother schemas predicted a range of daughter schemas. There was  evidence of direct transference (selective internalisation') of some schemas between mothers and daughters. Daughter schemas were associated with  . In particular, high authoritative  predicted lower levels of daughter schemas and high overprotective  predicted higher levels of daughter schemas. There was no firm evidence that authoritative  mediated the relationship between mother and daughter schemas in this domain. The major limitations of this  are the cross-sectional design and relatively small sample. In conclusion, mother maladaptive schemas and  of  predict daughter schemas.

From social representations to action: proximity and the relation between social representations of the development of intelligence and authoritative parenting style,2016,"A well-established body of literature holds that the construction of social reations of intelligence is guided by the subjective inexplicability about the target-topic and by the social identities of subjects. Within the general framework of the sociogenesis of social reations, this article aims to explore the role of social positions in organizing an individual's reported action towards the object of reation. A theoretical model which examines the relations between social reations of the development of intelligence, al goals and the authoritative   was tested in sub-samples of educators, which included 227 mothers, 117 fathers and 122 mother-teachers. Structural equation modeling procedures indicated, as hypothesized, that specific socio-cognitive dynamics are relevant in shaping the patterns of relations with the object of reation, suggesting that these dynamics are a  of the organization of multiple discourses where content, social positions and behavioural interaction are strongly intertwined. Theoretical contributions of findings are discussed."

In these tests, adolescents raised according to the inconsistent  scored lower in connectedness and higher in mental disorders than those raised according to the controlling or flexible-oriented  pattern. Authoritative  was associated with a higher level of connectedness with the family and better mental health of adolescents. A higher level of adolescent-family connectedness is associated with better mental health of adolescents. Results indicate that authoritarian  within an authoritarian culture does not harm the adolescents' mental health as it does within the Western liberal societies. These  give rise to the hypothesis that inconsistency in  and inconsistency between the   and the culture cause harm to adolescents' mental health."
Psychologically Controlling Parenting during Toddlerhood: The Role of Mothers' Perceived Parenting History and Emotion Regulation Style,2020,"This  investigated whether mothers' own perceived  history (in their own family of origin) relates to mothers' self-reported use of psychological control during the toddler period and whether mothers' emotion regulation capacities play an important underlying role in this regard. A community sample of 150 primiparous mothers participated in a longitudinal , including both a prenatal and postnatal assessment (2 years after birth). Results of structural equation modeling indicated that mothers' own retrospectively perceived history of psychologically controlling  prior to birth related to their psychologically controlling  behavior vis-a-vis their toddlers. Mothers' maladaptive emotional regulation, and dysregulation in particular, was found to play a mediating role in this association. The  highlight that mothers' perceived  history is an important prenatal predictor of mothers' own (self-reported) use of psychological control in the first years after birth, with maternal emotion regulation helping to account for this association."
Parenting asthmatic : Identification of parenting challenges,2008,"Asthma is the most common chronic illness of hood, affecting up to 14% of . Poor asthma management and non-adherence to treatment regimens are a pervasive problem in this population and are related to exacerbation of symptoms. Effective management of pediatric asthma involves a complex set of interactions between the  and , yet there is a paucity of literature examining these interactions. The main purpose of this  was to identify the  behavior and asthma management tasks s experience difficulty with. It was hypothesized that the more asthma behavior problems reported, the more problems s experience in asthma management tasks. Participants in this  were 255 s of 2- to 10-year-old asthmatic , recruited via an advertisement placed in school newsletters throughout Australia. Results indicated that the most problematic  asthma behaviors were oppositional behavior, hyperactivity, and aggression, and anxiety was  identified by s as a concern. The main problematic asthma  tasks were entrusting the school, entrusting caregivers, identifying unique symptoms, and identifying and avoiding triggers. More problem asthma behaviors were associated with higher levels of  difficulty and more general levels of behavior problems. s who reported more dysfunctional   reported more difficulties with their 's asthma behavior. Based on the  it is suggested that an appropriate  intervention program would target basic behavioral management skills, in addition to applying these behavior management principles to asthma management."
Association Between Independent Reports of Maternal Parenting Stress and Children's Internalizing Symptomatology,2011,"Although considerable  has investigated  stress and 's externalizing behavior problems, comparatively less has considered  stress in relation to 's internalizing difficulties.

"Temperament, parenting styles and the intensity of early maladaptive schemas: assessment of correlations in a non-clinical adult group",2021,"Background: Prior  has partially verified the significance of  temperament and  of upbringing for schema intensity. However, there is still a lack of understanding of the inter-relations between them. Aim: The   examined how temperament (stable and labile) and  of  (positive and negative) are related to each other, and to early maladaptive schemas. Method: Participants (395 healthy adults) completed the Young Schema Questionnaire YSQ-S3 and the Retrospective Assessment of s' Attitudes and Formal Characteristic of Behaviour - Temperament Inventory (FCB-TI). Structural equation modelling was used to verify hypotheses. Results: Temperament and al  together explain more than 59% of the variance of schema intensity. The obtained path coefficients show one-way directions of inter-relations. Stable temperament connects to schemas directly with a negative path coefficient. Labile temperament shows a significant positive association with negative al attitudes, but not directly with schemas. Negative  is positively connected with schemas. A positive  of  is not significantly connected with temperament and schemas. Conclusions: Results show evidence that negative  of  and labile temperament features are more important for schema developing and may be treated as risk factors. Because temperament seems to be a relatively persistent feature, it may play a similar role in adulthood, reinforcing emotions and feelings in the context of environment, and then maintain the schemas."

Exploring the Influence of Parenting Style on Adolescents' Maladaptive Game Use through Aggression and Self-Control,2021,"Adolescent aggression manifests in problematic game use and ultimately undermines life quality. This  deals with the mechanisms behind adolescents' perception of , maladaptive game use, self-control, and life satisfaction within the context of integrated supportive-positive  and harsh-negative . Using 778 valid panel data from the Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA), we reached the conclusions that both supportive-positive  and harsh-negative , mediated by self-control and maladaptive game use, are major predictors of adolescents' life satisfaction. PLS-SEM analysis was used for the hypothesized model test. This  helped bridge the gap in existing  by finding clues to recovering - relationships from the side effects of youth game use."
Parenting and Temperament Influence on School Success in 9-13 Year Olds,2017,"Children spend a lot of time with their s who are the first agents that educate them.

However, there are other variables related to school success, for example, temperament. The influence of  decreases with age as  develop abilities to self-regulate without s' external control. The aim of the   was to evaluate the contribution of   and temperament in 9-13 years old  on both academic performance and school adjustment skills. Our hypothesis was that not only   is crucial to academic performance and school adjustment, but  temperament plays an important role in them. We used a  Guide line questionnaire to evaluate  , Early Adolescence Temperament Questionnaire-R to evaluate temperament; Health Resources Inventory to assess 's school adjustment, and academic grades, as indicator of academic performance. We were interested in testing whether or not the effect of   on academic performance and school adjustment was mediated by temperament. We found that emotional and behavioral regulationmediates the relation between  and academic performance. These findings inform of the relevance of 's temperament on school success. Implications for education are discussed with emphasis on the importance of understanding students' temperament to promote school adjustment and good academic performance."

Adolescents viewed their s as more permissive and more authoritarian than s viewed themselves, whereas s viewed themselves as more authoritative than did adolescents. s'   differentiated their conceptions of al authority, but adolescents' perceptions did not. Differences were primarily over the boundaries of adolescents' personal jurisdiction. Furthermore, conceptions of al authority and   both contributed significantly to emotional autonomy and adolescent- conflict.

"The gender specific mediational pathways between parenting styles, neuroticism, pathological reasons for drinking, and alcohol-related problems in emerging adulthood",2009,"Mediational links between  , neuroticism. pathological reasons for drinking, alcohol use and alcohol-related problems were tested. A two-group SEM path model with 441 (216 female, 225 male) college students was examined. In general, pathological reasons for drinking mediated the impact of neuroticism on alcohol use and alcohol-related problems. A different pattern of relationships was found for each of the two genders. Perceptions of having an authoritarian father were positively linked to higher levels of neuroticism among males but this pattern was not found among females. For males. neuroticism mediated the impact of having an authoritarian father on pathological reasons for drinking with pathological reasons for drinking mediating the impact of neuroticism on alcohol-related problems. Perceptions of having a permissive father were linked to lower levels of neuroticism in females (but have been found as a consistent risk factor for other pathways to alcohol use elsewhere). Compared with other work in this area, these findings indicate al influences regarding vulnerabilities for alcohol use may be specific to - gender matches for some pathways and specific to one  (irrespective of  gender) for other pathways.

Adolescents' Conflict Management Styles with Mothers: Longitudinal Associations with Parenting and Reactance,2018,"Adolescents' conflict management  with s are assumed to have an important impact on the quality of the -adolescent relationship and on adolescents' psychosocial development. Longitudinal  investigating possible determinants of these conflict management skills is scarce. The  context and adolescents' tendency to reject maternal authority are expected to shape adolescents' conflict management . Therefore, the  three-wave longitudinal  focuses on how  and adolescents' reactance relates to adolescents' conflict management  and conflict frequency with mothers over time, and whether reactance may  explain the associations between  and certain conflict variables. We addressed these  questions by using a hybrid cross-lagged panel model with  as a latent variable (i.e., supportive ) and the other variables as manifest variables. Supportive  was measured by four well-known  dimensions: autonomy support, responsiveness, psychological control, and harsh control. Four conflict  were investigated: positive problem solving, withdrawal, conflict engagement, and compliance. Questionnaires were completed by 812 adolescents at three annual waves (52% girls at Time 1). Supportive  was associated with fewer conflicts, more positive problem solving, and less compliance and reactance over time. Reactance was associated with more conflicts, conflict engagement and withdrawal, and less compliance. We did not find evidence for the mediating role of reactance in the over-time associations between  and adolescents' conflict management and frequency. Both  and reactance appeared important and unique determinants for adolescents' conflict management  and frequency."

Socioeconomic Status and Parenting Style From Childhood: Long-Term Effects on Cognitive Function in Middle and Later Adulthood,2019,"Objectives: This  assesses whether hood socioeconomic status (SES) is related to cognitive function and cognitive change at mid and later life and explores the buffering effects of   and adulthood SES. Method: Data were derived from the 3 waves of the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) , a national survey including 7,108 participants aged from 24 to 75 years at baseline. We used multiple regression and multilevel models to investigate the associations between hood SES, adulthood SES, and cognitive performance and change at midlife and the role of s' affection and discipline. Results: Low hood SES was associated with lower cognitive function and more cognitive decline at mid and later life. Adulthood SES moderated the effect of hood SES on cognitive function. Interactions showed that paternal discipline was positively related to cognitive function among participants with low hood SES, and negatively related to cognitive function among participants with high hood SES. High paternal affection was associated with less cognitive decline at mid and later life. Discussion: The findings advance the understanding of the long-term consequences of SES and psychosocial factors in early life that can lead to optimal cognitive function in middle and old age."

Style over substance: what can parenting styles tell us about ownership styles and obesity in companion animals?,2015,"Obesity is a major medical concern in human subjects, and most concerning is the rapid recent increase in hood obesity. Children are more likely to be obese if their s are obese, an effect that is mediated both by genetics and environment, most notably al influence. Four major   have been recognised: authoritative; authoritarian; indulgent; uninvolved. Too much al control, as with the authoritarian , is associated with a higher weight status in . Conversely, indulgent feeding  can  have negative consequences and, where control is too lax, a poor relationship with food develops, which may  lead to weight gain. Obesity is  a growing concern in companion animals, and it has parallels with obesity in . For instance, overweight people are more likely to own overweight dogs. Furthermore, the care that people provide for their pets mirrors that which s provide for , and pets are commonly viewed as  substitutes. These similarities raise obvious questions about whether different  of pet ownership exist, and what part they may play in attitudes to feeding as well as predisposition to obesity in pets. Future work could focus on determining to what extent  of pet ownership mirror  , whether there are links to obesity in dogs and cats. Knowledge regarding the owner-pet bond might provide comparative insights into the links between   and hood obesity."
"Parenting Style, Basic Psychological Needs, and Emotional Creativity: A Path Analysis",2018,"This  examined the relationship between al  and emotional creativity and investigated the mediating role of the fulfillment of basic psychological needs in this relationship. The population included 3372 undergraduate students, among whom, 375 (177 females and 198 males) were selected by multi-stage cluster sampling method. The respondents filled in three questionnaires as follows: 1) the Emotional Creativity Inventory (ECI), 2) the s as Social Context Questionnaire (PSCQ), and 3) the Basic Psychological Needs Scale (BPNS). A path analysis showed that the components of   could predict students' emotional creativity. In detail, the warmth and structure  of  positively and the coercion and chaos  of  negatively predict emotional creativity of students. The dimensions of autonomy and competence (of satisfying the basic psychological needs) had a mediating role between   and emotional creativity. These  showed the importance of factors (  and basic psychological needs) influencing emotional creativity of students. A greater focus on satisfying the dimensions of basic psychological needs (i.e. autonomy and competence) and proper   (i.e. warmth and structure ) could lead to a higher level of creativity among students."
On the development of regulatory focus: The role of parenting styles,2008,"The   was designed to contribute to our understanding of the development of chronic self-regulatory orientations reflecting self-regulation with a promotion and prevention focus, respectively. Little  addressed this issue empirically, although regulatory focus theory (RFT) explicitly entails assumptions concerning the role of   in the development of habitual self-regulatory orientations. According to RFT,   involving a critical and punitive mode that is focused on attaining safety and meeting obligations increases the likelihood that the  will acquire a predominantly prevention-focused  of self-regulation. In contrast,   involving a bolstering mode that is focused on accomplishing ideal goals and fulfilling aspirations increases the likelihood that the  will acquire a predominantly promotion-focused  of self-regulation. To test these assumptions, the   assessed via self-reports the degree to which participants experienced different   as well as their chronic self-regulatory focus.

Parenting as Protective Factor Against Aggressive and Oppositional Behavior of Children? Stock Taking and Practical Conclusions,2018," behaviors or  play an important role in theories on the development and maintenance of externalizing problems (aggressive, delinquent, or oppositional behavior) such as in the general theory of crime or in coercion theory. In addition,  training programs have been recommended as important means for preventing or reducing externalizing problems in hood and adolescence. The  review assessed the empirical base for these theoretical suggestions and recommendations, mainly by use of meta-analytic evidence. Cross-sectional studies show, on average, small negative associations between al warmth, behavioral control (such as monitoring, rule setting), autonomy support, and authoritative  and externalizing symptoms (with correlations of about r = .15), while harsh control (e. g., use of physical punishment), psychological control (trying to direct the 's behavior by manipulating his or her feelings), as well as authoritarian, permissive, and neglectful  are related to higher symptom levels. These cross-sectional associations are, in part, based on the effects of externalizing problems on . Cross-lagged associations of initial  with change in externalizing symptoms show a similar trend but tend to be very small (r < .10), with initial al behaviors or   explaining less than 0.5% of the variance of change in the dependent variable at posttest. Thus, rather stable  practices or  will likely produce very few new changes of externalizing problems in the near future. The situation changes when improvements in  (after  training) affect externalizing symptoms. Participation in such training tends to explain about 4% of the variance of the change in externalizing problems, with changes in  mediating most of the training effect.  training can even have large effects, explaining about 40% of the variance of externalizing problems at posttest if the  initially had high levels of these problems and the s had difficulties in managing these symptoms. The  paper discusses reasons for the systematic difference in the effect sizes of longitudinal and intervention studies. In addition, differential practical recommendations are provided for families with different degrees of  externalizing problems and positive . s already showing rather high levels of al warmth and behavior control or authoritative , respectively, should be encouraged to maintain these behaviors even if new effects of these al practices are not visible. While these families may  derive a small benefit from participation in  training, such training is strongly recommended in the case of elevated externalizing problems and al problems with  management. Here, training with s tends to produce effects similar to the effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy with the ."
Development of the General Parenting Observational Scale to assess parenting during family meals,2015,"Background: There is growing interest in the relationship between general  and hood obesity. However, assessing general  via surveys can be difficult due to issues with self-report and differences in the underlying constructs being measured. As a , different aspects of  have been associated with obesity risk. We developed a more objective tool to assess general  by using observational methods during a mealtime interaction. Methods: The General  Observational Scale (GPOS) was based on prior work of Baumrind, Maccoby and Martin, Barber, and Slater and Power. Ten dimensions of  were included; 4 were classified in the emotional dimension of  (warmth and affection, support and sensitivity, negative affect, detachment), and 6 were classified in the behavioral dimension of  (firm discipline and structure, demands for maturity, psychological control, physical control, permissiveness, neglect). Overweight  age 8-12 years old and their  (n = 44 dyads) entering a weight control program were videotaped eating a family meal. s were coded for their general  behaviors. The Mealtime Family Interaction Coding System(MICS) and several self-report measures of general  were  used to assess the - interaction. Spearman's correlations were used to assess correlation between measures. Results: The emotional dimensions of warmth/affection and support/sensitivity, and the behavioral dimension of firm discipline/structure were robustly captured during the family meals. Warmth/affection and support/sensitivity were significantly correlated with affect management, interpersonal involvement, and communication from the MICS. Firm discipline/structure was inversely correlated with affect management, behavior control, and task accomplishment. s who were older, with higher educational status, and lower BMIs were more likely to display warmth/affection and support/sensitivity. Conclusion: Several general  dimensions from the GPOS were highly correlated with similar family functioning constructs from the MICS. This new observational tool appears to be a valid means of assessing general  behaviors during mealtimes and adds to our ability to measure -level factors affecting  weight-related outcomes. Future evaluation of this tool in a broader range of the population and other family settings should be conducted."

Parenting and perceived maternal warmth in European American and African American adolescents,2008,"Traditional conceptualizations of   assume certain associations between  practices/philosophies and al warmth. This  examines whether those links are similar for European American and African American adolescents. Two hundred and ninety-eight early adolescents and their mothers reported on discipline and control practices, decision-making practices, and  philosophy, which were used to predict adolescents' reports of maternal warmth. The moderating role of ethnicity was examined after controlling for gender, age, and socioeconomic status. Although some practices predicted warmth similarly across groups, several practices predicted warmth in ways consistent with   theory only or more strong among European American adolescents. The findings suggest differences in the interpretation of or context surrounding discipline- and autonomy-related practices in these groups."

The two criteria variables were captured with the five dimensions of the AF5, Five-Factor Self-Concept Questionnaire, and with self-transcendence and conservation Schwartz values. Results confirm emergent  in  socialization: the use of al warmth is evidenced as key for adolescent self-esteem and internalization of social values in the three countries analyzed. Indulgent and authoritative  (both characterized by al warmth) are associated with the highest value internalization in the three countries. Furthermore, indulgent  (use of warmth) is associated with the highest adolescent self-esteem, overcoming authoritative  (use of warmth and strictness).

The aim was to assess the extent to which group identity is reflected in self-reported characteristics. Most students self-identified either as studious, athletes, populars, rebels, or normals (N = 669) and  completed measures of perceptions of al  and attributional . Consistent differences were observed between self-identified studious and rebel teenagers. One-way ANOVAS revealed significant group differences on mother's authoritativeness, father's authoritativeness, positive attributional , and negative attributional . These  are discussed with reference to the interplay between group influences and individual characteristics. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
Sex-based differences in parenting styles in a sample with preschool ,1998,"Sex-based differences in   were examined using mother and father self-reports from a sample of s (N = 305) with a preschool boy or girl as the target. The 11 individual  investigated were components of the authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive  patterns. A number of mean-level differences were found between the   of mothers and fathers, as well as between the  of boys and girls. For example, mothers were higher than fathers on the  comprising the authoritative pattern, and there was evidence of fathers being more likely than mothers to use the  in the authoritarian and permissive patterns. The authoritarian  were more likely to be used when  boys, and the authoritative  of reasoning/induction was more likely when  girls.

How to improve parenting in Hong Kong by training: the 6As Positive Parenting Program,2019,"Purpose - Research suggests that  in Hong Kong are at an elevated risk of emotional problems. Authoritarian , a common   in Hong Kong, is a critical factor associated with hood mental health problems. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of the 6As Positive  Program (6As) in modifying  attitudes, reduction of  stress and increasing self-efficacy in positive , among a sample of 82 Hong Kong s. 6As focuses on prevention by instilling positive  beliefs and principles, thereby reducing reliance on authoritarian and related  . Design/methodology/approach - The program was evaluated using a controlled pre-post-treatment design. Outcome measures were the Chinese Child-rearing Beliefs Questionnaire, al Stress Scale,  Self-efficacy Scale and participant feedback. ANOVA and correlation were utilized to detect treatment effects and relationships between the degree of change among measures and subscales. Findings - Relative to the control group, the 6As Positive  Program significantly changed s'  attitudes, reduced  stress and increased self-efficacy in positive . In sum, 97.6 percent of the participants agreed that the program is a good fit for the Hong Kong culture. Research limitations/implications - A larger sample would have been desirable for this . One factor that limited analyzable data was that some of the participating organizations enrolled participants into the program who did not meet  inclusion criteria. Furthermore, the size of groups varied from 5 to 16 participants, which may have produced different group dynamics that added variability to outcomes. Future 6As  program  should attempt to standardize group size or to directly compare the effectiveness of smaller vs larger groups. Furthermore, as noted earlier, the  was conducted during the primary school application period, which may have heightened the  stress for s of younger . Practical implications - The  suggest that an enhanced belief in authoritative, autonomy and training strategies could reduce al stress and shift s' attitude toward a more positive approach in -rearing. Social implications - There is considerable need for a holistically designed  training that is culturally credible and sensitive. Originality/value - Findings suggest that positive  can enhance the - relationship and reduce al stress. The  support governmental, non-governmental organizational and community focus on positive practices for  training in Hong Kong."

The purpose of this  was to investigate the relationships between al alexithymia and three  of  (authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive) and the relationships between al alexithymia and two domains of psychological control (dependency and achievement). The participants were 946 s ages 29-60 years (mothers: n = 473, M age = 44.6 yr., SD = 4.7; fathers: n = 473, M age = 48.1 yr., SD = 5.1) of  ages 11-18 years. All participants completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20), the al Authority Questionnaire-Revised (PAQ-R), and the Dependency-Oriented and Achievement-Oriented Psychological Control Scale (DAPCS). Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to examine whether alexithymia could predict the three   (authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive) and the two domains of psychological control (dependency and achievement). The first model showed that alexithymia was a positive predictor of authoritative and permissive  and a negative predictor of authoritarian  in both paternal and maternal data. The second model showed that, in both paternal and maternal data, alexithymia was a positive predictor of both dependency-oriented psychological control (DPC) and achievement-oriented psychological control (APC)."

Emerging adults with more permissive mothers viewed grades as less important than emerging adults with less permissive mothers. Mothers' authoritarian , mothers' permissive , and relationship quality with father were differentially related to academic engagement depending on emerging adults' gender. Both mothers' and fathers'  characteristics may affect the academic engagement of emerging adults via past  behaviors and current quality of the -offspring relationship, despite decreased physical proximity of emerging adults and their s."

"Poor Parenting, Attachment Style, and Dating Violence Perpetration Among College Students",2021,"Although dating violence is prevalent among college students, little is known about how both attachment  and participation in risky behaviors contribute to this pattern of violence. To address this literature gap, we examine the role of poor ,  abuse, attachment , and risky sexual and drug use behaviors on dating violence perpetration among 1,432 college students (51% female). Path analysis  revealed that females were more likely to report greater attachment anxiety but lower attachment avoidance compared with males. Correlates of attachment anxiety included  physical abuse, witnessing al violence, and poorer maternal relationship quality whereas attachment avoidant behavior was linked to more physical abuse and poorer maternal relationship quality. Females were more likely to perpetrate dating violence as were those with greater attachment anxiety and lower attachment avoidance. Other correlates of dating violence perpetration included sexual and drug risk behaviors. Finally, distal factors (i.e., more  physical abuse and poorer maternal relationship quality)  were associated with dating violence perpetration. Study implications are  discussed."
Retrospective reports of parental physical affection and parenting style: A study of Finnish twins,2008,"Individual differences in  behaviors are due, in part, to genetic factors. In the  , the authors sought to determine whether the degree of genetic influence varied according to the type of al behavior under consideration. A population-based sample of 2,334 pairs of Finnish twins provided ratings on the physical affection, control, abusiveness, and indifference shown by their father and mother during hood. Genetic influences, shared environmental influences, and nonshared environmental influences accounted for a small-to-medium proportion (17%-30%), a small-to-large proportion (22%-44%), and a medium-to-large proportion (37%-55%) of the variance in each  measure, respectively. There were no significant differences in effect sizes for mothers and fathers or across the 4 types of al behavior. The genetic  may reflect characteristic  with which s respond to genetically influenced behaviors of individuals (gene- environment correlations) or individual perceptions of this relationship (gene-person correlation processes). The findings have implications for intervention and prevention work with families and for interpretation of evidence for interactions between genes and  behaviors."
Effects of Parenting Styles and Family Contributors on Physical Activity Behaviors in Arab Children Ages 6-10 Years Old Living in the US,2020,"The purpose of this  was to explore the effects of   and family contributors on physical activity behaviors in Arab  living in the US. This mixed-method  included the Caregiver's Feeding Style Questionnaire (CFSQ), Family Nutrition Physical Activity (FNPA) survey, and five focus group discussions (FGD), guided by the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). Twenty-three Arab mothers of 37  aged 6-10 years old participated in this . Seventeen mothers were overweight or obese, and six  were overweight or obese. Although all Arab mothers self-assessed that they were authoritative, only seven mothers were categorized as having an authoritative feeding  based on their CFSQ scores. The FNPA overall mean was 3.15, indicating less obesogenic family environments and behaviors. Across FGDs, common physical activity barriers included lack of time, the  being distracted by technology, and lack of a mother's interest in a 's physical activity due to culture and fear. Positive approaches included considering the 's interest in sports and involvement in physical activity with the . Negative attitudes included pushing the  to do sports and the mother's lack of interest in physical activity. In correlation analyses, the mother's BMI was significantly correlated with the 's BMI z-scores (r = 0.325, p = 0.005). No significant associations were found between reported feeding  (CFSQ), obesogenic family environments (FNPA), and 's BMI z-scores. This  can guide future efforts in developing effective education programs, including physical activity behaviors for Arab families."

In general, in education there is not a pure , but there are guidelines that define how to educate: the intensity and frequency with which we show our affection, the quality and quantity of communication, and how to set limits and standards. Using the Teaching Styles Questionnaire, we conducted a descriptive  of the relationship between s and , in order to explore  ; and provide guidance for family education that develops skills and abilities in the s, and facilitates 's educational processes. We found that democratic forms of education are characterised by displays of direct of love and affection of s towards their  and a high degree of autonomy, while the absence of signs of affection, poor communication, excessive control and punishment of unwanted behaviours in , may be related to more authoritarian  of education."

Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, frequency chi square tests, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA); while post hoc  were determined through Tukey's honestly significant difference. Results found that authoritative  provides a delay in the age of sexual debut for Jewish adolescents. All other   had mean ages less than the overall mean age of sexual debut, 17.10 years old, with indifferent  having the earliest debut. These findings suggest that   may affect the timing of Jewish adolescents' sexual debut.

Relationship of parenting style to behavioral adjustment in graduating high school seniors,1998,"Research on the four prototypic   has consistently demonstrated their relationship to psychosocial and behavioral adjustment in offspring ranging in age from preschool  to high school students. The   used self-report surveys administered only to graduating high school (HS) seniors (2250 participants). Students indicated their levels of participation in a variety of problem behaviors and conventional behaviors, as well as rating their perceptions of their s on three  dimensions: acceptance (responsiveness), behavioral control (demandingness), and democracy (psychological autonomy granting). Using these values, students could be assigned to 1 of 6 groups reing the   with which they perceived they had been reared: authoritative plus,  authoritative, authoritarian midrange,  indulgent, and neglectful.   was significantly related to older adolescent behavioral adjustment (p <.0001) in this HS Sr. sample even after statistically adjusting for the effects of gender, SES, and family structure. While   did not moderate socioeconomic status and family structure, it was found to be a powerful mediator of these two independent variables. The democracy dimension, although an important component of al attitude was found to be unnecessary in effectively defining authoritative  after the other two dimensions, acceptance and behavioral control, were considered. This  expands the   typology to include a fifth middle-range  , and it demonstrates the significant mediating power of   on SES and family structure. Previously established advantages and disadvantages of the four classic  , pins a middle-range , persist even when they are extended to a sample comprised strictly of older adolescents at the brink of high school graduation."

Also, 220 young offenders took part recruited from four Youth Detention Centres of Valencia, in which they were carrying out court sentences. The age of the subjects range from 15-18 years. The  indicate that the emotional variables act as mediators in general, in the non-offender adolescents, but it has been observed, in the offender adolescents, a direct effect of support on aggressive behavior in a negative way and on prosociality in a positive way; and of negligence on aggressive behavior and of permissiveness on prosociality in a negative way."
Genetic susceptibility to parenting style: DRD2 and COMT influence creativit,2020,"The   systematically investigated if genetic variations in the DRD2 and COMT interacted with   to predict individual differences in creativity. In a sample of young adults, we first examined the interaction of each individual polymorphism and   on creativity. Then, we aggregated the contribution of these susceptibility polymorphisms into a Cumulative Genetic Score (CGS) which combines the plasticity conferred by two or more single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of DRD2 and COMT into a single score. When polymorphisms were examined in isolation, the  indicated there were only two polymorphisms from COMT (rs5993882 and rs5993883), which were found to interact with mother authoritativeness to predict creativity. However, a CGS comprising of several potential susceptibility polymorphisms from DRD2 and COMT genes did indeed interact with   to explain a significant amount of variance in the creativity. Furthermore, the analysis of regions of significance (Ros) showed supporting evidences for differential susceptibility model, such that the individuals with high CGS were more likely to be affected by their both negative and positive  , demonstrating higher and lower creativity. These  further provide evidence for the involvement of dopaminergic genes in the relationship between   and creativity and suggest individuals with the greater susceptibility are the ones who are more susceptible to environmental influences."
Nine types of temperament model and its relation to parenting styles,2000,"Differentiating three areas within each of the two basic temperament dimensions make it possible to propose a model of nine temperament types. The model includes four traditional types and five mixed ones.

We found agreement as well as marked differences in the   in relationship to the individual temperament types of boys and girls. For both sexes, the dimensions anxious-stable and social extravert-introvert relate to the   in the family in a different way. The differences in the   of boys and girls and their relation to the temperament of these adolescents can be hypothetically interpreted in connection with differences in masculine and feminine roles. The  bring suggestions for further  on the relationship between temperament and   as well as implications for practical applications, primarily in the areas of education and counseling, concerning boys and girls belonging to different temperament types."
BEYOND PARENTAL CONTROL AND AUTHORITARIAN PARENTING STYLE - UNDERSTANDING CHINESE PARENTING THROUGH THE CULTURAL NOTION OF TRAINING,1994,"This  addresses a paradox in the literature involving the   of Asians: Chinese  has often been described as ''controlling'' or ''authoritarian.'' These  of  have been found to be predictive of poor school achievement among European-Americans, and yet the Chinese are performing quite well in school. This  suggests that the concepts of authoritative and authoritarian are somewhat ethnocentric and do not capture the important features of Chinese  rearing, especially for explaining their school success. Immigrant Chinese and European-American mothers of preschool-aged  were administered standard measures of al control and authoritative-authoritarian   as well as Chinese -rearing items involving the concept of ''training.'' After controlling for their education, and their scores on the standard measures, the Chinese mothers were found to score significantly higher on the ''training'' ideologies. This ''training'' concept has important features, beyond the authoritarian concept, that may explain Chinese school success."

A systematic review investigating associations between parenting style and  feeding behaviours,2014,"Background: A direct association between   and  feeding behaviours has not been established. This review explores whether an authoritative, authoritarian or permissive   is associated with al pressure to eat, responsibility, monitoring or restriction of  dietary intake. Methods: A search of eight electronic health databases was conducted. Inclusion criteria were  aged <12 years, published between 1975 and 2012, measured and reported associations between   and  feeding behaviours. Results: Seven studies (n = 1845) were identified in the review. An authoritarian   was associated with pressuring a  to eat and having restrictive al food behaviours. Authoritative  was associated with al monitoring of  food intake. A permissive   was inversely related to monitoring of  dietary intake. Conclusions:   showed only weak to moderate associations with individual domains of  feeding. The most consistent relationship found was a negative association between permissive  and monitoring for both mothers and fathers in two studies. Progress in this field could be achieved by conducting studies targeting fathers and culturally diverse populations, and development of a tool which could reflect overall  feeding behaviour rather than individual domains."
The Parenting Dimensions of British Pakistani and White Mothers of Primary School Children,2011,"There is increasing emphasis internationally on the use of  programmes to support the development of appropriate social behaviour in . However, in such programmes diversity is often ignored. Research into the   and practices (dimensions) of different ethnic groups is needed in order to investigate the applicability of universal programmes, to guide their design and implementation in the future. Thirty-four British Pakistani and 34 British White mothers of primary aged , comprising equal numbers of males and females, completed English or Urdu versions of the al Dimensions Inventory-Short Version (PDI-S), (Power, Int. J. Behav. Dev. 67: 302-313) and a  behavioural screening instrument, the SDQ (Goodman, J. Child Psychol. Psychiatry 38: 581-586). More similarities than differences between the  dimensions of Pakistani and White mothers were found overall. However, compared with White mothers, Pakistani mothers reported more 'following through on discipline' as well as 'reminding' as a disciplinary action. Further, Pakistani mothers reported following through on discipline more with boys than White mothers did and the more they reported inconsistent , the more their  reportedly had behaviour problems. It is concluded that while these findings provide some support for the cross-cultural applicability of generic  programmes, programme efficacy studies are  needed.

Methods: s of 55  with diabetes completed   and regimen adherence questionnaires. Glycosylated hemoglobin  were collected by chart review. Results: al warmth was associated with better adherence ratings. Regression analyses showed that al warmth explained 27% of the variance in adherence ratings. al restrictiveness was associated with worse glycemic control in univariate analyses. However, only Black ethnicity, not adherence or  variables, predicted glycemic control. Black ethnicity and lower socioeconomic status (SES) were associated with more al restrictiveness and worse glycemic control. Conclusions: These  suggest that authoritative , characterized by support and affection, may be advantageous for the regimen adherence and glycemic control of school-age and younger  with diabetes. Demographic characteristics are important and require further  in this context."
"The Structural Relationships of Parenting Style, Creative Personality, and Loneliness",2008,"The purpose of this  was to examine the nature of the relationships between 's reports of their mother's and father's   (leniency and acceptance), teacher's reports of 's creative personality, and teacher's reports of 's loneliness in school in a sample of South Korean sixth graders (N=421). Using structural equation modeling, the  showed that   that reflected higher levels of leniency were associated with higher levels of loneliness and no relationship with 's creative personality.   that reflected higher levels of acceptance were associated with higher levels of creativity in their , but did not have a direct effect on loneliness. However, there was an indirect effect; the relationship between acceptance and loneliness was mediated by creativity."
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PARENTING STYLES AND GENDER ROLE IDENTITY IN COLLEGE STUDENTS,2014,"The relationship between perceived   and gender role identity was examined in college students. 230 undergraduate students (48 men, 182 women; 18-23 years old) responded to the al Authority Questionnaire (PAQ) and the Bem Sex-Role Inventory (BSRI). The hypothesis was that   (authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive for both fathers and mothers) would be significantly associated with gender role identity (undifferentiated, feminine, masculine, and androgynous) of college students, specifically whether authoritative   associated with androgyny. To account for differences in sex on gender role identity or  , sex was included as a factor. The pattern of the difference in identity groups was similar for males and females. There were signifi cant differences in   between gender role groups. Maternal and paternal authoritativeness correlated with participants' femininity, and for both s, the relationship was observed to be stronger in males than females; paternal authoritativeness was significantly associated with androgyny. Future  based on these  should investigate how the findings relate to 's psychological well-being and behavioral outcomes."
The Importance of Personality and Parental Styles on Optimism in Adolescents,2014,"Some studies have suggested that personality factors are important to optimism development. Others have emphasized that family relations are relevant variables to optimism. This  aimed to evaluate the importance of   to optimism controlling for the variance accounted for by personality factors. Participants were 344 Brazilian high school students (44% male) with mean age of 16.2 years (SD = 1) who answered personality, optimism, responsiveness and demandingness scales. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted having personality factors (in the first step) and maternal and paternal  , and demandingness and responsiveness (in the second step) as predictive variables and optimism as the criterion. Personality factors, especially neuroticism (beta = -.34, p < .01), extraversion (beta = .26, p < .01) and agreeableness (beta = .16, p < .01), accounted for 34% of the optimism variance and insignificant variance was predicted exclusively by al  (1%). These findings suggest that personality is more important to optimism development than al ."
The Grandparents' Influence: Parenting Styles and Social Competence among Children of Joint Families,2017,"The  examined the moderating effect of emotional closeness to grands on the relationship between   of s and social competence of . A total of 297 individuals (99 mothers, 99 fathers and 99 adolescents) living in joint family system including three generations (grands, s, and grand), with at least one  aged 13-18 years, participated in the . Stepwise hierarchical regression analyses showed that -reported  predicted 's social competence even after controlling for demographic and -reported  and explained 7-18 % of the variance in social skills of . Emotional closeness to grands moderated the relationship between mother authoritativeness and overconfidence of  (beta = -.30, p < .05; Delta R (2) = .09), suggesting a positive relationship between mother authoritativeness and overconfidence of  when  are low on emotional closeness to grands and a negative relationship when  are high on emotional closeness to grands. Emotional closeness to grands  moderated the effect of father authoritativeness on inappropriate assertiveness (beta = -.37, p < .05; Delta RA(2) = .13) and withdrawal (beta = -.36, p < .05; Delta RA(2) = .08) of , suggesting that an increase in father authoritativeness is associated with a decrease in undesired traits, i.e., inappropriate assertiveness and withdrawal, under higher levels of emotional closeness to grands. It is concluded that in the course of psychosocial development, the emotional closeness of  to grands serves as safeguard against negative family conditions."
"Parental dysphoria and 's adjustment: Marital conflict styles, 's emotional security, and parenting as mediators of risk",2007,"Dimensions of martial conflict, 's emotional security regarding interal conflict, and   were examined as mediators between al dysphoria and  adjustment. A community sample of 262 , ages 8-16, participated with their s. Behavioral observations were made of s' interactions during marital conflict resolution tasks, which  later observed to assess their emotional security. Questionnaires assessed s' dysphoria, , and 's adjustment. Structural equation modeling indicated that al dysphoria was linked with  adjustment through specific and distinct mediating family processes, including marital conflict and . Children's emotional security in the context of particular marital conflict   mediated relations between al dysphoria and  adjustment problems, with similar pathways found for mothers and fathers. These pathways remained significant even after significant  contributions were considered."
"More Similar to My Father, Better Academic Performance I Will Have: The Role of Caring Parenting Style",2021,"Background: - facial resemblance, as an important cue of paternal uncertainty, may impact fathers'  behaviors and further affect 's academic performance. However, mothers are almost 100% confident of the blood relationship with their  and care less about the facial resemblance cues. Methods: To test these hypotheses, the   recruited 122 junior high school students and measured the perceived facial resemblance with their s, the s'  , academic performance, and demographic variables. Results: The  showed that the perceived father- facial resemblance rather than the mother- facial resemblance significantly influenced adolescents' academic performance. Further, fathers' caring   mediated the relationship between the perceived father- facial resemblance and academic performance. Conclusion: These findings not only supported the paternal uncertainty hypothesis but  extended the al investment theory."
Family Socialisation Styles and Hostility in the Adolescent Population,2018,"The affective involvement of s in the socialization of their  is fundamental for the proper psychological and emotional adjustment of adolescents, although we know that it is difficult to . In this , the relationship between   and hostility was analysed in Spanish adolescents. Five-hundred and thirty-six adolescents participated in this  (53.7% males and 46.3% females), between the ages of 12 and 18 (M = 15.76, SD = 1.43), enrolled in 4 compulsory Secondary Education centers of the Castellon province. Family socialization was evaluated through the al : authoritative, indulgent, authoritarian and negligent, and hostility, through the Cook-Medley Hostility Scale Criteria assessment. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was carried out with multiple regression analysis. The  showed that hostility and compound hostility are higher in adolescents from authoritarian and authoritative families than in adolescents from indulgent families. It was  observed that the Mother's Strictness/Imposition had the greatest effect on hostility, as well as a low acceptance/involvement of the father. Regarding al , it was observed that mother's deprivation, physical coercion, and mother's verbal coercion were the greatest predictors of hostility. No differences were observed depending on the gender."
Parenting styles and  behavior in African American families of preschool ,2002,"Examined the relations between   and  behavior problems in African American preschool . Participants were 108 African American female caregivers of 3- to 6-year-old . Correlational analysis showed that -reported  behavior problems were associated with maternal education, family income, and s' endorsement of authoritative , authoritarian , and permissive . Hierarchical regression analysis showed that the authoritative   was most predictive of fewer  behavior problems. These  are consistent with previous findings with European American families and provide strong support for the cross-cultural validity of the authoritative  ."
In search of the antecedents of adolescent authoritarianism: The relative contribution of parental goal promotion and parenting style dimensions,2007,"Although  drew attention to the importance of both al goal promotion and al rearing  in explaining adolescent authoritarian submission (Right-Wing Authoritarianism or RWA) and authoritarian dominance (Social Dominance Orientation or SDO),  failed to examine their combined effects. This  examines the relative contribution of  goals (i.e. extrinsic vs. intrinsic and conservation goals) and  (i.e. need support and regulation) and their interactions in the prediction of adolescent RWA and SDO. Cross-sectional analyses show that, whereas  goals and  and their interactions predict RWA, SDO is predicted by al goals only. However in a second, longitudinal , changes in RWA and SDO were predicted by  goals only. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
Parental support exceeds parenting style for promoting active play in preschool ,2012,"Emerging evidence suggests that   may directly or indirectly influence school-aged 's activity behaviour. Given that relatively fewer studies have been conducted among preschool-aged , this 's primary purpose was to examine the direct relationships between al support and   on preschool 's active play behaviour, and determine whether   acts as an effect modifier. One hundred and ninety-five s completed a questionnaire assessing their al support,  , and their 's active play behaviour. While controlling for  , al support was positively associated with active play behaviour (beta = 0.30, p < 0.001). However,   was not directly associated with active play nor did it moderate the relationship between al support and  active play (beta = 0.04, p = 0.90). Thus, to establish healthy active play behaviours in early  development, s are encouraged to provide sufficient levels of active play-related support."
The influence of parenting style on health related behavior of : findings from the ChiBS study,2014,"Objective: Exploring associations between  behavior and 's health related behavior including physical activity, sedentary behavior, diet and sleep. Methods: We recruited 288 s and their  (6-12y old). Children's weight and height were measured. Fat percentage was determined by air displacement plethysmography. s reported socio-demographic data, sleep information, physical activity and sedentary behavior of their  and completed the Comprehensive General  Questionnaire (CGPQ) and a Food Frequency Questionnaire. Children completed the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Associations between  behavior (CGPQ) and 's health related behavior were assessed with univariate and multiple regression analyses. Results: A small positive correlation was found between sweet food consumption frequency and coercive control (r = 0.139) and a small negative correlation between fruit and vegetables consumption frequency and overprotection (r = -0.151). Children consumed more frequently soft drinks when their s scored lower on structure (r = -0.124) and higher on overprotection (r = 0.123); for the light soft drinks separately, a small positive correlation with behavioral control was found (r = 0.172). A small negative correlation was found between emotional eating and structure (r = -0.172) as well as behavioral control (r = -0.166). Coercive control was negatively correlated with the 's sleep duration (r = -0.171). After correction for confounding factors, the following significant associations were found: (1) a small negative association between structure and soft drinks consumption (beta = -0.17 for all soft drinks and -0.22 for light soft drinks), (2) a small positive association between behavioral control and light soft drinks (beta = 0.34), (3) a small positive association of nurturance and coercive control with sedentary behavior (beta = 0.16 for both  constructs) and (4) a small negative association between the  construct coercive control and sleep duration (beta = -0.23). Conclusion: The significant but small associations between  constructs and the investigated variables suggest that different aspects of   play an important role in the genesis of the health related behavior of . Overall, our findings suggest that health professionals should encourage s to apply the more positive  constructs i.e., more structure and behavioral control, and less coercive control. They could, for instance, supervise and manage their 's activities and help their  to achieve certain goals."
"Parenting styles and emerging adult depressive symptoms in Cebu, the Philippines",2018,"Incidence of depressive disorders and symptoms increases during the transition to adulthood. The  relationship is a potential target for interventions to reduce risk for depression in offspring during this time period, and a four-category typology of   (authoritative, permissive, authoritarian, and neglectful) has been found to correlate with offspring psychological functioning. The majority of studies, however, have examined this four-category   typology in Western populations. We used the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS) from the Philippines to assess associations between   reported by offspring at age 18 and depressive symptoms reported by offspring at age 21 (N=1,723). Using adjusted linear regression models, we found that authoritarian and neglectful mothering  were positively associated with daughters' depressive symptoms, whereas authoritarian mothering was negatively associated with sons' depressive symptoms. Findings suggest both cross-cultural similarities and variability in positive . Results may have implications for family-based depression prevention interventions in the Philippines."
"Parenting Profiles, Intolerance of Uncertainty, and Worry among Chinese Primary School Children",2020,"This  identified the profiles of Chinese 's perceived   and examined profile differences in worry and intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and whether differences on worry were mediated by IU. A sample of 591 primary school  (aged 9-12 years) in China completed self-report questionnaires assessing perceived  , IU and worry. Latent profile analysis on six  dimensions (emotional warmth, rejection and overprotection for fathers and mothers) identified four  profiles: supportive, disengaged, harsh, and highly harsh. The supportive and disengaged  profiles showed lower levels of worry than the harsh and highly harsh  profiles, and the supportive  profile had the lowest level of IU. The  of multicategorical mediation analysis showed that difference in  worry between the supportive and harsh  profile was fully mediated by IU. The findings of this  revealed the internal mechanisms of  worry using a person-centered approach within the Chinese cultural background and provided initial evidence for  interventions to alleviate 's worry."
Permissive parenting and mental health in college students: Mediating effects of academic entitlement,2016,"Objective: Student mental health may suffer due to unreasonable expectations associated with academic entitlement; permissive  may be one source of these expectations. The authors examined the role of academic entitlement as a mediator of the relationship between permissive  and psychological functioning. Participants: Participants were 524 undergraduate students at a single institution (52% female; age range = 18-22). Data collection was completed in May 2011. Methods: Cross-sectional design. Participants completed online self-report measures of  , academic entitlement, stress, depressive symptoms, and well-being. Results: Permissive  was associated with greater academic entitlement and, in turn, to more perceived stress and poorer mental health. Mother/father differences were found in some cases. Conclusions: Academic entitlement may partially explain why permissive  is detrimentally related to mental health for college students. Implications for academic affairs and counseling include helping students develop an appreciation of the role of self-regulation in college success."
Victimization at school: relationship of parenting and functional-dysfunctional developmental variables,2015,"This  has the aim to analyze the different role of al  (affect and communication versus control), of functional developmental variables (empathy and adaptative coping ) and dysfunctional variables (emotional instability and inefficient coping ) in school victimization, or conversely with peer attachment. Participants were 418 Spanish adolescents, 224 girls and 194 boys, aged between 13 - 14 years old and attending year 7 and year 8 of secondary school. Structural equation modeling was carried out using the EQS program. Results shows that   of affect and communication versus negative control are both directly related to functional and dysfunctional developmental variables. Negative control is  directly related to the school victimization. Also, functional variables are directly related to the school victimization and peer attachment, while dysfunctional variables only are related to school victimization. Finally,  and their possible implications are discussed."
Managing young 's snack food intake. The role of parenting style and feeding strategies,2015,"One major contributor to the problem of hood overweight and obesity is the over-consumption of foods high in fat, salt and sugar, such as snack foods.

Participants were 611 mothers of  aged 2-7 years who completed an online questionnaire containing measures of general  domains and two particular feeding strategies, restriction and covert control. It was found that greater unhealthy snack intake was associated with higher restriction and lower covert control, while greater healthy snack intake was associated with lower restriction and higher covert control. Further, the feeding strategies mediated the association between al demandingness and responsiveness and  snack intake. These findings provide evidence for the differential impact of controlling and positive al feeding strategies on young 's snack intake in the context of general . (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Adolescents in Foster Care with Their Grandparents: Parenting Styles and Family Relationships,2008,"The aim of this  was to analyse the relationships between foster grands and their adolescent grand. The sample consisted of 54 grands from Malaga (Spain), with a mean age of 65.9 for grandfathers and 63.6 for grandmothers, who foster 70 adolescents, 31 boys and 39 girls, with ages ranging between 11 and 17. The majority of the grandfathers were retired, while the grandmothers worked at home. The grands ed a low level of education and scant economic resources. The  indicated that the relationship between the grands and grand was mainly perceived as good or very good. The grands perceived that grand maintained a better relationship with their grandmothers, whom they trusted more and to whom they disclosed more, than with their grandfathers. The grands recognised that their relationship with their grand was perceived more as - than grand-grand. The grands were more affectionate and communicative with their grand than critical or rejecting. They  used more inductive  than rigid or indulgent forms when applying rules.

Perfectionism and Perceptions of Parenting Styles in Male Youth Soccer,2011,"Although perfectionist orientations have been linked to a variety of cognitive, affective, and behavioral correlates in youth sport, little is known about antecedent factors that may influence adolescent athletes' perfectionist orientations. The purpose of this  was to determine whether perceptions of   differ as a function of adolescent athletes' perfectionist orientations. A total of 194 male youth soccer players (M age = 13.64 years; SD = 1.51; range, 10.67-16.25 years) completed measures of their perfectionist orientations in sport and of their perceptions of maternal and paternal  . Scores from the   measure were calculated such that higher scores were reflective of higher al authoritativeness (as perceived by the athletes). Cluster analyses conducted on perfectionism responses produced independent clusters of unhealthy perfectionists, healthy perfectionists, and nonperfectionists. MANOVA  revealed that both healthy-and nonperfectionists had significantly higher perceptions of maternal and paternal authoritativeness than unhealthy perfectionists (ps < .005). Results indicate that exposure to heightened authoritative  may play a role in developing healthy perfectionist orientations (or decrease the likelihood of developing unhealthy perfectionist orientations) in youth sport."
Parenting and Turkish 's behaviour problems: the moderating role of qualities of parent- relationship,2019,"The current  is an examination of contributions of   and qualities of - relationship (PCR) to Turkish 's externalizing and internalizing behaviours, with a specific focus on the moderating role of PCR (closeness and conflict) on   (authoritarian and democratic/authoritative) when predicting 's externalizing and internalizing behaviours. Participants were 94  (56 boys) with the mean age of 7.05 years (SD = 0.88) in a suburban district in Turkey. Mothers reported on their   and relationships with their  as well as 's externalizing and internalizing behaviours. Results from regression analyses showed that - closeness significantly moderated the association between authoritarian  and 's externalizing behaviours. - conflict significantly moderated the association between authoritarian  and 's internalizing behaviours. The - conflict was positively associated with 's externalizing behaviour and authoritarian  was positively associated with internalizing behaviour. Limitations and future directions of the current  are discussed."
Daily-Life Social Experiences as a Potential Mediator of the Relationship Between Parenting and Psychopathology in Adolescence,2021,"Adolescence is a vulnerable period for psychopathology development, and certain   are consistent and robust predictors of a broad range of mental health outcomes. The mechanisms through which maladaptive   affect the development of psychopathology are assumed to be largely social in nature. Yet, the social mechanisms linking  to psychopathology are unexplored at arguably the most important level of functioning: daily life. This  aims to identify the associations between three  , and the experience of daily-life social interactions. Furthermore, we aim to explore the extent to which these   and altered daily-life social experiences are associated with psychopathology. In this , we recruited a sample of N = 1,913 adolescents (63.3% girls; mean age = 13.7, age range = 11 to 20) as part of the first wave of the longitudinal cohort  SIGMA.   (psychological control, responsiveness, and autonomy support) and psychopathology symptoms were assessed using a retrospective questionnaire battery. The experienced quality of social interactions in different types of company was assessed using the experience sampling method, ten times per day for 6 days. Direct associations between   and general quality of daily-life social experiences were tested using a three-level linear model, revealing significant associations between social experiences and different  . When interaction effects were added to this model, we found that maternal responsiveness and paternal psychological control mainly related to altered qualities of social interactions with s, while paternal autonomy support was associated with better experiences of non-family social interactions. Finally, an exploratory path analysis highlighted how both paternal autonomy support and altered quality of non-family interactions are uniquely associated with psychopathology levels. These findings demonstrate the general and pervasive effects of maladaptive  , as  seems to broadly affect adolescents' interactions with different types of social partners in everyday life. Moreover, they illustrate a potential mediated relationship in which altered daily-life social interactions could drive the development of psychopathology. A stronger focus may be required on the role of altered day-to-day social experiences in the prevention and potentially, the treatment, of adolescent psychopathology."
Aspects of parenting and family functioning associated with obesity in adolescent refugees and migrants from African backgrounds living in Australia,2012,"Objective: To investigate the relationship between   and family functioning, and BMI, among adolescent migrants and refugees from African countries. Method: A total of 104 s and their adolescent offspring completed questionnaires assessing the variables of interest, and anthropometric data were collected from them. Results: s reported higher maternal involvement, lower levels of paternal involvement, higher levels of positive , greater use of other (non-corporal) discipline , greater satisfaction and better communication than did their offspring. s  reported greater family cohesion and flexibility than adolescents, and saw their families as more enmeshed and more rigid.   and family functioning were not strong predictors of BMI according to either report. For adolescents, inconsistent discipline and lack of al supervision accounted for significant variance in BMI. Conclusions: Inconsistent discipline and lack of al supervision may be related to adolescent BMI. Further studies with larger samples are required to confirm these relationships with the view to informing obesity prevention programs for this target population. Implications: Prevention or intervention programs aimed at reducing the prevalence of overweight and obesity need to consider   in their design."
Parenting style impacts on quality of life in  with cerebral palsy,2007,"Objective To assess the impact of   and disease severity on quality of life (QOL) in  with cerebral Palsy (CP). Study design Thirty-nine  with CP, their siblings, and their s participated in the . Probands and siblings, ages 6 to 18 years, completed questionnaires on   (accepting, rejecting, controlling, and autonomy allowing) using the Children's Report of al Behavior Inventory. s completed generic (Child Health Questionnaire [CHQ]) and disease-specific (Pediatric Outcomes Data Collecting Instrument [PODCI]) QOL questionnaires for both . A physician determined disease severity with the Gross Motor Function Classification System. Results In  with CP,   positively correlated with the CHQ scores: physical summary and psychosocial summary (r = 0.40, P = .01) and family activities scale (r = 0.34, P = .03). Autonomy allowing   impacted on psychosocial aspects of QOL, as reflected by CHQ scores, more than the degree of disability. In other domains of QOL, the effect of   was greater than IQ, anxiety, and socioeconomic status. Conclusions   is a significant factor in QOL in CP and the only known factor to impact on the psychosocial domains of the CHQ, exceeding the effect of disease severity. Because QOL is an important treatment goal in  with CP, early family interventions, particularly those focusing on  , should be considered."
Persistently Obese Youth: Interactions Between Parenting Styles and Feeding Practices With Child Temperament,2013,"Objective. To assess the interaction of  and  characteristics with feeding practices and mealtime functioning. Design. Longitudinal, predictive  comparing baseline characteristics with follow-up assessments. Participants. The caregivers of 52 persistently obese youth and 32 nonoverweight comparison youth completed measurements of  temperament, al feeding practices,  , and interactions during mealtimes. Results. Adolescents with persistent obesity were significantly more likely to be ed using problematic feeding practices when s  reported difficult  temperaments. Additionally, adolescents with persistent obesity and difficult temperaments were significantly more likely to have lower levels of positive mealtime interactions. Conclusion. Persistently obese youth are at increased risk for problematic al feeding practices and mealtime functioning, particularly when youth are described as having difficult temperaments. These  indicate that further investigations are needed to better understand the mechanisms linking  and  characteristics with health-related behaviors for adolescents with obesity."
"Parenting and preschool  behaviour among Turkish immigrant, migrant and non-migrant families",2011,"When families migrate the new culture and culture of origin may conflict, with possible consequences for  and 's development. Turks form one of the largest immigrant groups in Western Europe, and there is  much movement within Turkey. This  compares three groups; Turkish immigrants to the UK (N=142), migrants within Turkey (N=229), and Turkish non-migrants (locals, N=396). The  were 39-71 months old (M=58 months, SD=6.5), 392 were boys and 375 were girls. s supplied data on family characteristics and , and teachers supplied data on 's behaviour. Using Baumrind's  model and allowing for background effects, compared to non-migrants and migrants, the immigrant s were less permissive and more authoritarian. Children in immigrant families had more externalizing problems, internalizing problems and emotional dysregulation and less social competence than migrant and non-migrant . Multilevel models and structural equation models both found that these effects upon  behaviour were evident after taking into account demographic factors and were not eliminated by taking into account   differences, and thus suggest that immigration and migration are risk factors for  behaviour. Effects of immigrant and migrant status were partly direct and partly indirect via their effects on ."
Parenting Style and Parent-Adolescent Relationship Quality in African American Mother-Adolescent Dyads,2019,"Objective. This  examined the relations between   and perceived mother-adolescent relationship quality in a socioeconomically diverse sample of African American mothers and adolescents. Design. African American female caregivers (N =?109) completed measures of maternal warmth, maternal monitoring, and information on family demographics. Adolescents completed measures assessing their perceptions of specific aspects of mother-adolescent relationship quality and demographic information. Results. Authoritative mothers reported greater monitoring than mothers classified as having authoritarian, indulgent, and neglectful . Authoritative mothers  reported higher levels of warmth than mothers classified as authoritarian or neglectful . Authoritarian mothers reported significantly higher levels of monitoring when compared to indulgent mothers and neglectful mothers. Consistent with predictions, adolescents with authoritative mothers reported more positive mother-adolescent relationship quality in the form of greater communication, trust, and alienation when compared to adolescents with authoritarian and neglectful mothers. Against predictions, neither household income nor adolescent gender moderated the associations between   and mother-adolescent relationship quality. Results from several exploratory analyses are  reported. Conclusions. The mother-adolescent relationship benefits from authoritative  in socioeconomically diverse African American families."
"Transformational Parenting Style, Autonomy Support, and their Implications for Adolescent Athletes' Burnout",2019,"The aim of this  was to examine the relationships between transformational , autonomy support displayed by mothers and fathers, and sport burnout in 360 junior soccer players (324 males, range age = 12-18 years). To this end, four steps were followed. Steps 1 and 2 tested the psychometric properties (i.e., factorial structure, internal consistency, and evidence of discriminant validity) of the Spanish version of the Transformational  Questionnaire (TPQ), and steps 3 and 4 examined the proposed relationships. Overall, the Spanish TPQ demonstrated adequate factorial validity and satisfactory internal consistency, reing a valid and reliable adaptation of the instrument. The   suggested a positive association between transformational  and autonomy support by both s, and a negative association between transformational  and sport burnout, mediated by autonomy support by mothers but not by fathers. Additionally, players who perceived their families as employing highly transformational  displayed lower levels of sport burnout than players who perceived their families as displaying low levels of transformational  behaviours. Findings support the positive consequences of displaying transformational  and autonomy-supportive environments in preventing young soccer players' burnout."
Ecological Predictors of Disciplinary Style and Child Abuse Potential in a Hispanic and Anglo-American Sample,2008,"Recent attention to multicultural issues has sparked recognition that  is  a culturally construed phenomenon. The   involved a diverse sample of 90 Anglo-American and Hispanic s examining predictors based on distal/proximal levels as conceptualized in the ecological model. The  examined background characteristics (e.g., minority status, educational level, income), intrapersonal (anger,  competence,  satisfaction), and extrapersonal (social support) factors in the prediction of  abuse potential and dysfunctional disciplinary . s participated anonymously in an in-home assessment. Neither minority status nor income predicted abuse potential or   beyond what was accounted for by educational level. The pattern of findings for the sample suggests the relative importance of anger expression,  self-efficacy, and social support satisfaction in both abuse potential and disciplinary  for both Hispanic and Anglo-American s. Future  directions with diverse samples are considered, including the need for measures specifically designed to assess  issues in diverse cultural groups."
Parenting style during hood is associated with the development of chronic pain and a patient's need for psychosomatic treatment in adulthood A case-control study,2020,"The aim of this  is to investigate the relation between   and chronic pain and the patients' need for psychosomatic treatment in adulthood. We compared 4 combinations of 2   subscales, high and low care and overprotection, among the following 4 age- and sex-matched groups: community-dwelling subjects without chronic pain (n = 100), community-dwelling subjects with chronic pain (n = 100), outpatients with chronic pain (n = 50), and inpatients with chronic pain (n = 50).   was assessed for both the mother and father by use of the al Bonding Instrument questionnaire. The   associated with the worst outcome was defined as both low care and high overprotection, as reported in previous studies. The frequency of reported adverse   was significantly higher among chronic pain patients than community-dwelling subjects without chronic pain (allP < .05). The odds ratios for an adverse   significantly increased through the categories after adjusting for demographic factors and the pain visual analog scale (Pfor trend <.01). These findings suggest that al low care and high overprotection during hood contribute to the future risk of chronic pain and the patients' need for psychosomatic treatment in adulthood."
"'Tiger mom, panda dad': a study of contemporary Chinese parenting profiles",2019,"The goal of this  was to explore the inter-al differences and the major clusters of Chinese  profile in a sample of preschoolers' fathers and mothers in urban China. Eighty-six Chinese couples in Shenzhen completed a   questionnaire, and four couples were interviewed to provide additional illumination. A paired t-test was used to find inter-al differences and cluster analysis was used to find major clusters of  profiles. Mothers were more authoritarian than fathers. Three major clusters of  profiles were found: easy-going , followed by tiger  and supportive . Inter-al differences existed among these couples, and 'tiger moms' and 'panda dads' were common in these Chinese families."
Testing maternal depression and attachment style as moderators of early head start's effects on parenting,2011,"This  examined maternal depression, attachment avoidance, and attachment anxiety as moderators of Early Head Start's effects on four  outcomes assessed at age three. Participants (N=947) were drawn from six sites of the Early Head Start National Research and Evaluation Project, a multi-site randomized trial. Findings suggest more positive program effects for mothers with less initial attachment avoidance or attachment anxiety. First, baseline attachment avoidance moderated Early Head Start program effects on observed maternal supportiveness, such that program mothers with lower baseline attachment avoidance were rated as more supportive of their three-year-olds than program mothers with higher baseline attachment avoidance. Second, program effects on spanking varied depending on mothers' baseline attachment anxiety."
The effectiveness of parenting programmes facilitated by health visitors,2001,"Aim of the . This  was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of  programmes that are facilitated by health visitors and offer practical and emotional support to s in the Down Lisburn Trust, Northern Ireland. Methods. All s (n = 78) taking part were given a self-administered questionnaire both before and after attending a 'Positive ' programme. The questionnaire contained items gathering demographic information, standardized measures of clinical anxiety/depression, personality states and coping  and participants' experience of being a  and what they wanted from the  group. Two items adapted from the  Stress Index looked at participants' ratings of themselves as s, and if they enjoyed this role. Statistical analysis. All statistics were computed using the SPSS for Windows (version 7) statistical package. The parametric paired-samples t-test was used with the ratio data generated by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire. It is used to test the difference between the means of the pre and postsets of scores for significance. The nonparametric Wilcoxon test was used to find if there was a significant difference between the pre and postprogramme related samples hy ranking the means. The Wilcoxon was chosen firstly because the data were ordinal in nature, hence it cannot be assumed that the findings follow the normal curve of distribution and secondly because it cannot be assumed that the data have homogeneity of variance. Findings. At the end of the 8-week  programme, findings demonstrated significant statistically reduced levels of clinical anxiety and depression. s demonstrated an increase in more positive ratings of personality states such as not shouting at their  and being more calm and energetic at the end of the programme. Adaptive problem focused coping strategies were reported as being used more often subsequent to the programme, although some of the less adaptive emotion focused strategies had  increased in use. However, no change was evident in their ratings of how good a  they were or if they enjoyed being a . Conclusions. Health visitors have the skills and are in the position to be preventative agents of inadequate , and advocates of positive . Factors relevant to the realm of positive  are highlighted as possible avenues for future ."
"Traditional parenting practices, risky parenting styles in mothers towards adolescent ",2020,"The purpose of this  was to analyze the beliefs and attitudes of 15 mothers about traditional  practices in their primary family context associated with risky   that they exercise with their  between the ages of 12 and 16 years of age. Municipality of Pensilvania-Caldas. This  was oriented with a type of exploratory-descriptive , with the focus group interview guide being the information gathering instrument For the selection of the population sample, convenience sampling was implemented, and as a data analysis procedure, the qualitative data analysis method was used. The  showed that the aggressive behaviors at the psychophysical level exercised by mothers towards their  are a consolidated multigenerational construction from existing cultural traditions, negatively affecting the adolescent's perception of herself and her world. It is concluded that the traditional socio-family upbringing component does significantly influence the maternal beliefs and attitudes that they express and practice in raising their  when consolidating their roles at the socio-family level."
"Parenting Style, Religiosity, Peer Alcohol Use, and Adolescent Heavy Drinking",2014,"Objective: The purpose of this  was to examine the associations of  , religiosity, and peer alcohol use with alcohol use and heavy drinking. Method: Structural equation modeling was used to estimate direct and indirect associations among 5,419 adolescents ages 12-14 years from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997. Results: Adolescents whose s were authoritative were less likely to drink heavily than adolescents who experienced neglectful or indulgent  . Religiosity was negatively associated with heavy drinking after other relevant variables were controlled for. Conclusions: Authoritative  appears to have both direct and indirect negative associations with the risk of heavy drinking among adolescents. Authoritative , where monitoring and support are above average, and religiosity might help deter adolescents from heavy drinking, even when adolescents experience peer environments where alcohol use is common. Authoritarian , although it was not associated with heavy drinking, was positively associated with alcohol use and peer alcohol use, thus placing adolescents at some risk"
Parenting and Emerging Adult Internalizing Problems: Regional Differences Suggest Southern Parenting Factor,2017,"Although the effects of   have received much consideration in the  literature, less attention has been given to outcomes in emerging adults. Also, regional differences among areas of the United States may influence s to use varying degrees of  practices such as affection and discipline. The current  investigated the differences in  in two geographically close yet distinct regions of the United States and the associated psychological outcomes in emerging adults. The sample was derived from two datasets: one consisting of participants predominantly from Southern states and one predominantly from Florida. The participants reported on maternal and paternal perceived   and discipline tactics as well as their own internalizing problems. Most notably, authoritative  of both s shared a direct relationship with authoritarian  in the Southern sample, whereas this was an inverse relationship in the Florida sample. Maternal authoritarian  shared a negative relationship with internalizing symptoms in the Mississippi sample, whereas this relationship was positive in the Florida sample. Additionally, paternal permissive  shared a negative relationship with internalizing symptoms in the Florida sample, whereas no relationship was found in the Mississippi sample. For both samples, paternal, not maternal, corporal punishment and maternal, not paternal, psychological aggression were related positively to emerging adult internalizing problems. Overall, it was found that both  characteristics as well as associated outcomes differed by region, suggesting the need for increased awareness and sensitivity to these differences."
"Boyfriend, girlfriend in a traditional society: Parenting styles and development of intimate friendships among Arabs in school",2008,"The development of intimate same- and other-sex friendships in Arab  and adolescents in Israel was investigated in relation to their perceived  . It was hypothesized that girls would show higher levels of intimacy than boys, and that cross-sex intimacy in both groups would increase with age, whereas same- sex intimate friendship maintains rather stable over the school years. We hypothesized further that intimate friendship would be contingent more readily on perceived al authoritative  rather than on either permissive or authoritarian . Participants were 723 Arab students drawn from four schools, and from the 5th, 7th, 9th, and 11th grades. The al Authority Questionnaire and Intimate Friendship Scale were employed as measures. Findings indicated that girls were more intimate with their female friends than boys were with their male friends, especially in the higher grades, replicating previous studies. However, boys tended to score higher than girls on intimacy with the other gender. Girls equaled their level of intimacy only at the 11th grade. These findings suggest that traditional societies may foster specific characteristics of intimate friendship. A novel finding is the central role of the authoritative   in determining intimate friendships. Results are discussed in terms of universal aspects of friendship and of their expression in the investigated cultural setting."
Authoritative Parenting Among Immigrant Chinese Mothers of Preschoolers,2009,"The goals of this  were: (a) to examine authoritative   among Chinese immigrant mothers of young , (b) to test the mediational mechanism between authoritative   and 's outcomes; and (c) to evaluate 3 predictors of authoritative   (psychological well-being, perceived support in the  role,  stress). Participants included 85 Chinese immigrant mothers and their preschool . Mothers reported on their  , psychological well-being, perceived  support and stress, and 's hyperactivity/attention. Teacher ratings of  adjustment were  obtained. Results revealed that Chinese immigrant mothers of preschoolers strongly endorsed the authoritative  . Moreover, authoritative  predicted increased 's behavioral/attention regulation abilities (lower hyperactivity/inattention), which then predicted decreased teacher rated  difficulties. Finally, mothers with greater psychological well-being or  support engaged in more authoritative , but only under conditions of low  stress. Neither well-being nor  support predicted authoritative  when  hassles were high. Findings were discussed in light of cultural- and immigration-related issues facing immigrant Chinese mothers of young ."
Parenting Behavior and Cognitions in a Community Sample of Mothers with and without Symptoms of Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder,2008,"Although attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults has recently emerged as an important area of , little attention has been given to the family functioning of women with ADHD, particularly in their role as mothers. We examined  self-esteem, locus of control, and disciplinary  in a community sample of mothers with varying levels of ADHD symptoms. Women with high levels of ADHD symptoms reported more occupational and psychiatric problems than women with lower levels of ADHD symptoms. They  reported lower  self-esteem, a more external  locus of control, and less effective disciplinary . The findings suggest that women with ADHD symptoms may face a number of difficulties within the  domain."
"Parenting, Peer Relationships, Academic Self-efficacy, and Academic Achievement: Direct and Mediating Effects",2017,"The aim of the   is to analyze the relation between authoritative and permissive   with the kinds of adolescent peer relationships (attachment, victimization, or aggression), and of the latter ones, in turn, with academic self-efficacy, and academic performance, in three waves that range from the early-mid adolescence to late adolescence. Five hundred Spanish adolescents, of both sexes, participated in a three-wave longitudinal  in Valencia, Spain. In the first wave, adolescents were either in the third year of secondary school or the fourth year of secondary school. The mean age in the first wave was 14.70 (SD = 0.68; range = 13-16 years). Child Report of al Behavior Inventory (Schaefer, 1965; Samper et al., 2006), Peer Attachment (from the Inventory of  and Peer Attachment by Armsden and Greenberg, 1987), Victimization (from the Kit at School, Buhs et al., 2010), Physical and Verbal Aggression Scale (Caprara and Pastorelli, 1993; Del Barrio et al., 2001), items of academic self-efficacy, and items of academic performance were administered. Structural equations modeling-path analysis was employed to explore the proposed models. The  indicated that   relate to the way the adolescents develops attachments to their peers and to academic self-efficacy. The mother's permissive  is an important positive predictor of aggressive behavior and a negative predictor of attachment to their peers. At the end, peer relations and academic self-efficacy are mediator variables between   and academic performance."
"Cognitive ability, parenting and instruction in Vietnam and Germany",2013,"In a sample of N = 105 fifth graders from Vietnam and Germany, cognitive abilities (CogAT-Nonverbal, i.e. fluid figural, CogAT-Quantitative, i.e. crystallized mathematics), family attributes,  , leisure time activities, and attributes of school and instruction were compared. In spite of large cultural and economic differences, the general cognitive ability levels were similar (M-Vnm = 99.43 vs. M-Deu = 99.13 IQ points in current UK norms). This  is in contradiction to usual outcomes in developing countries. However, regarding family, , school and instruction, differences were observed: German families had more books. German s were less frequently married and German families less frequently consisted of both mother and father. Vietnamese s had more . Vietnamese s showed higher levels of authoritarian and neglecting . German  read more books. The Vietnamese did not attend kindergarten, had larger classes, more homework, and more private tuition.

Intergenerational Continuity of Risky Parenting: A Person-Oriented Approach to Assessing Parenting Behaviors,2014,"Limited  has investigated the long-term effects of hood emotional abuse on later forms of . This  utilized a person-centered approach to explore the relation between retrospectively-reported maternal hood emotional abuse and observed  behaviors during a conflict discussion. Data were collected from 53 caregiver- dyads with  ages 8-11. Results of a model-based clustering procedure (Mclust; Fraley and Raftery 2006) identified three   (negative, at-risk, positive) that were based on five observed  behaviors (emotion regulation, anger, hostility, psychological control, and psychological unavailability). Results indicated that higher levels of hood emotional abuse were reported by women in the at-risk and negative  subgroups. Mothers in the negative  and at-risk  clusters exhibited greater levels of emotional abuse when compared to the positive  cluster. Possible implications are discussed, and  underscore the importance of emotionally abusive developmental experiences in the understanding of risk for maladaptive  behaviors."
PARENTING STYLES AS MEDIATORS BETWEEN MATERNAL TRAIT ANXIETY AND PRESCHOOLERS' SOCIAL ANXIETY: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY,2021,"Maternal anxiety has been shown to be a risk factor for 's anxiety disorders. More evidence is needed on the mediating factors of this relationship. The role of   (assertive, punitive, overprotective, and inhibited) in the relationship between maternal trait anxiety and social anxiety in preschoolers was examined. Spanish mothers (N = 199) of 3- to 5-year-old  participated completing report measures. Punitive  was the only significant mediator of the relationship between maternal trait anxiety and 's social anxiety. More anxious mothers tended to use punitive and overprotective . Children exposed to punitive or inhibited  tended to  higher social anxiety. More evidence is needed on the role of   in other anxiety disorders in preschoolers."
Racial Differences in Parenting Style Typologies and Heavy Episodic Drinking Trajectories,2015,"Objective: This  examines racial differences between Whites and Blacks in the association of   typologies with changes in heavy episodic drinking from adolescence to young adulthood. Method: The analytic sample consists of 9,942 adolescents drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, which followed respondents from ages 12 to 31 years. Confirmatory factor analysis and factor mixture modeling are used to classify   typologies based on measures of al acceptance and control. Heavy Episodic Drinking (HED) trajectories are evaluated using a zero-inflated Poisson multigroup latent growth curve modeling approach. Results: The mixture model identified 4 heterogeneous groups that differed based on the 2 latent variables (al acceptance and control): balanced (65.8% of the sample), authoritarian (12.2%), permissive (19.4%), and uninvolved or neglectful (2.7%). Regardless of race, we found that at age 12 years,  of authoritarian s have a higher probability of not engaging in HED than  of s with balanced, permissive, or neglectful  . However, among Black youth who reported HED at age 12, authoritarian  was associated with greater level of HED at age 12 but a less steep increase in level of HED as age increased yearly as compared with balanced . For White adolescents, uninvolved, permissive, and authoritarian  were not associated with a greater level of HED as age increased yearly as compared with adolescents exposed to balanced . Conclusion: The influence of   on HED during adolescence persists into young adulthood and differs by race for youth engaging in HED."
Triple P-Positive Parenting Program for Mothers of ADHD Children,2014,"Objective: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic, highly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder which affects 9% of school-age . Triple P-Positive  Program is an evidence-based  program reported to be useful in the management of this disorder.

"Parenting styles moderate how parent and adolescent beliefs shape each other's eating and physical activity: Dyadic evidence from a cross-sectional, US National Survey",2019,"Psychological theories of health behavior focus on intrapersonal influences on behavior. Greater attention to interpersonal effects and the relational contexts that regulate them has the potential to improve theory, and offer innovative strategies for intervention. This  takes a dyadic approach to understanding how  and adolescent beliefs influence each other's health behaviors, and how the relationship context of -adolescent dyads moderates these effects. Using the Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating  (FLASHE), we analyze responses from 1717 -adolescent dyads from across the U.S., and explore a dyadic extension to the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). We evaluate how   that characterize each -adolescent dyad moderate the degree to which s' and adolescents' own attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are associated with the other person's behaviors across four domains: fruit and vegetable consumption, junk food and sugary drinks consumption, engagement in physical activity, and engagement in screen time sedentary behaviors.

However, we  find that the association between adolescents' attitudes, social norms, and perceived behavioral control and their s eating behavior tends to be stronger when s have an authoritative  . These findings show the importance of context in evaluating interpersonal influence, and hold implications for health-relevant interventions."
Functional somatic symptoms in a Spanish sample: Psychopathology and educational styles,2013,"Introduction: Although there are many studies on functional somatic symptoms (FSS), there are few conducted with Spanish samples. The aim of this  was to assess the prevalence of frequent functional somatic symptoms in a Spanish sample, and to look for relationships with psychopathology and  . Patients and methods: The sample consisted of 672 participants from 6 to 8 years-old attending primary school in the region of Osona (Catalonia, Spain). The s reported on the presence of FSS in , school absence, paediatric visits; psychiatric symptoms, and  . Children who complained of frequent somatic symptoms (four or more in the previous fortnight) were compared with  who did not complain. Results: A total of 429 of the 672 (63.8%)  had at least one physical complaint during the two weeks prior to the . Almost one quarter (162, 24.1%) of the participants had frequent FSS. Significant relationships were found with, separation anxiety, social phobia, and visits to the paediatrician. A small effect of overprotection/control   on FSS was observed. Conclusions: Functional somatic symptoms are common in a Spanish sample of  between 6 to 8 years-old. These  may be considered a risk group for future emotional distress. It is  important for future  to clarify the nature of the relationship between overprotection and FSS. (C) 2012 Asociacion Espanola de Pediatria. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.

Family Social Environment and Parenting Predictors of Alcohol Use among Adolescents in Lithuania,2017,"The role of the family as the social environment in shaping adolescent life has recently received substantial attention. This  was focused on investigating the association between familial and  predictors and alcohol use in school-aged . Adolescents aged 13-and 15-year from a reative sample (N = 3715) of schools in Lithuania were surveyed during the spring of 2014. The methodology of the cross-national Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC)  was applied. HBSC international questionnaires were completed in the classroom anonymously for obtaining information about drinking of alcoholic beverages and family characteristics-family's affluence and structure,  of communication in the family,  , al monitoring, family time together, etc. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied for assessment of the association between familial variables and weekly alcohol use. Analysis has demonstrated that adolescents from non-intact families tended to show significantly higher risk of being weekly drinkers (OR = 1.69; 95% CI: 1.30-2.19). The following  factors were associated with weekly use of alcohol: father's and mother's low monitoring, father's authoritarian-repressive and mother's permissive-neglectful  . Frequent family time together and frequent electronic media communication with s showed an inverse negative effect than was predicted. The  suggests that alcohol misuse among adolescents could be associated with a non-intact family structure as well as with complex family and  determinants which should be investigated more thoroughly by further studies."
Perceived Parenting Style and the Eating Practices of College Freshmen,2012,"Background: Unhealthy eating contributes to morbidity in adolescents and college students and is an antecedent of premature mortality in adulthood. It has been suggested that the increase in independence (i.e., living away from s) of adolescents contributes to their poor eating behaviors. Some literature reports that specific   may reduce the probability of engaging in poor eating practices. Purpose: We investigated the association between college freshmen's eating practices and their perceptions of  . Methods: An Internet-based survey was used to sample 264 college freshmen between the ages of 18 and 20 years from a large southeastern university. Data analysis used univariate and bivariate statistics along with multiple regression analysis. Results: Student eating practices fell short of optimal dietary recommendations. Whereas the literature suggests that   predicts healthy eating during early adolescence, it did not predict healthy eating in this sample of college freshmen, accounting for less than 1% of the variance in eating practices. Nevertheless, responses to an open-ended question suggested that some students believed that s had influenced their current eating behaviors. Discussion: We found little evidence of any latent effects of   on eating behaviors among college freshmen. Translation to Health Education Practice: Despite positive al influences, as it relates to health eating, continued reinforcement at the individual (e.g., skill enhancement with regard to meal preparation), interpersonal (e.g., role modeling healthy eating practices among peers), community (e.g., establishing famers' markets) and organizational (e.g., increased access to healthy food options in cafeterias) levels is needed."
"Perceptions of Father Parenting Style, Empathy, and Self-Esteem Among Greek Preadolescents",2012,"This  examines the relationship between early adolescents' perceptions of their father's   and two outcomes, global self-esteem and empathy. One hundred ninety primary school pupils (mean age = 11.26 years, standard deviation = 0.73) completed the  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire, the Index of Empathy for Children and Adolescents, and the Self-Perception Profile for Children. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlations, and regression analyses. Findings suggested a significant link between paternal   as perceived by preadolescents and preadolescents' empathy and global self-esteem. The participating pupils tended to perceive their fathers as predominantly supportive, whereas perceptions of self and empathy were quite high. Finally, preadolescents' perception of their father's   was a significant factor in predicting preadolescents' global self-esteem and empathic behavior. The  findings support previous evidence attesting to a link between , father- communication, and aspects of  psychosocial development."

The teenagers' s were classified into one of four groups (authoritative, authoritarian, indulgent, or neglectful). The adolescents were then contrasted on two different outcomes: (1) priority given to Schwartz's self-transcendence (universalism and benevolence) and conservation (security, conformity, and tradition) values and (2) level of self-esteem (appraised in five domains: academic, social, emotional, family and physical). The  show that Spanish adolescents from indulgent households have the same or better outcomes than adolescents from authoritative homes.  is related with two self-esteem dimensions-academic and family-and with all the self-transcendence and conservation values.

African American Adolescent Engagement in the Classroom and Beyond: The Roles of Mother's Racial Socialization and Democratic-Involved Parenting,2009,"Previous  has explored how differential youth outcomes are associated with racial socialization and   individually, but very little work has examined whether democratic-involved   bolsters the positive link between racial messages and adolescent outcomes. The purpose of this  was to examine mothers' use of democratic-involved  as a moderator of the association between racial socialization (e.g., racial pride, racial barrier, and self-worth messages) and youth engagement. The types of engagement explored were attitudes toward class work and persistence on task. Ninety-four African American youth (ages 11-14) reported on maternal  and socialization. As predicted, racial barrier socialization was positively associated with engagement among adolescents who perceived their mothers to provide more involvement coupled with opportunities for their teens to make decisions. In contrast, barrier socialization and engagement were negatively associated among adolescents who viewed their mothers as low in democratic-involved . Implications for adolescent engagement and for  on racial socialization and democratic-involved   are discussed."

Behavior problems and dysfunctional parenting: Cross-sectional study in Japan,2019,"Background The Japanese government has established a law encouraging early detection and treatment of developmental disorders in . Child behavior problems (CBP) tend to be recognized at school as a  of developmental disorders. The aim of this  was to identify factors associated with CBP in Japan. We hypothesized that factors other than developmental disorders are important in explaining CBP. Methods The  was conducted between February and March 2015. s of 3,515  aged 2-5 years attending one of 34 public nursery schools in Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan received self-administered questionnaires addressing al socioeconomic factors, mental health,   (i.e. hostile, overreactive, or lax), developmental disorders in , and CBP. A multiple regression analysis was applied to explore associations between CBP and possible factors. Results Overall, 1,410 mothers were eligible to participate in the . Children diagnosed with developmental disorders accounted for 7.8% of the sample, while on the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory 17% of  had behavior problems needing clinical intervention. After adjustment for confounding factors, as well as for the diagnosis of developmental disorders, poor mental status and all three dysfunctional   had strong associations with CBP, and hostile, overreactive, and lax  had standardized beta-values (beta) of 0.29, 0.28, and 0.15, respectively (P < 0.01). A problematic relationship between the s was  significantly associated with CBP (beta = -0.29, P < 0.01). Conclusion When CBP are identified,  skills, mental health status and al relationships should be considered along with the possibility of developmental disorders in the development of interventions."
Mother-Daughter Communication About Sex: The Influence of Authoritative Parenting Style,2012,"- communication about sex has been shown to delay sexual activity and increase contraceptive and condom use. The influence of authoritative   and mothers' perception of daughters' risk on communication about sex was examined in this . Mothers in a random sample (n = 283) with daughters aged 9-15 years were mailed surveys asking about communication with their daughters regarding 11 sex-related topics. Multivariate linear regression was used to assess the influence of authoritative   and mothers' perceptions of risk on the number of topics communicated about and age of the daughter at time of communication for a variety of sexual health communication topics. Authoritative   was related to the number of topics communicated about and was a predictor of age of daughter at the time of communication about sexual intercourse, menstruation, dating/relationships, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), HIV/AIDS, alcohol, contraceptives, and abstinence, while perceptions of risk were not significant influencers of age at the time of communication for any topics. This  points to the importance of   in determining the timing of - communication about sexual and other risk behaviors."

In the working class, full-time homemakers obtained higher depressive mood scores than employed mothers, and depressive mood mediated their higher scores on permissive  and partially mediated their higher scores on authoritarian . The employment/depression relationship was not moderated by marital status, fathers' help, number of , or presence of a preschooler. It was mediated by locus of control but not by financial concerns or loneliness. In the middle class, employment was not related to mood, authoritative or permissive , but homemakers indicated more authoritarian  orientations. The middle-class employment/depression relationship was moderated by number and age of : fewer  and no preschooler were associated with higher depression for homemakers and lower depression for employed mothers. The effect of depressed mood on  orientations was moderated by education and al commitment, but only in the middle class."
Parenting satisfaction and self-efficacy: A longitudinal study of mothers of  with Down syndrome,2012,"Continuities and changes in  sense of competence were examined for mothers of  with Down syndrome from early hood to adolescence. The sample comprised 25 mothers whose  with Down syndrome was aged 4-6 years in the first phase of the , and 11-15 years at the second time point. Maternal satisfaction with  increased over time, but there were no changes in  self-efficacy. Scores on these measures were no different from those reported in a normative sample of mothers of typically developing , suggesting that the challenges of  a  with Down syndrome do not impact significantly on  sense of competence during the early hood and adolescent periods. There were some significant relationships of maternal sense of competence with  characteristics and self-reported  , mostly in the expected direction."
Single Custodial Fathers' Involvement and Parenting: Implications for Outcomes in Emerging Adulthood,2010,"Using a sample of 3,977 youths from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97), this  examines the unique characteristics of single-custodial-father families with adolescents and the effects of single fathers' involvement and  on outcomes in emerging adulthood. Findings suggest that single-custodial-father families are distinct from single-mother and 2-biological- families in terms of sociodemographic characteristics,  , and involvement.   and involvement mediate the differences between single-father families and 2- families in terms of high school completion and disconnectedness and partially mediate differences for single-custodial-father families with a partner. Family and sociodemographic characteristics are  associated with being disconnected for adolescents residing with a cohabiting custodial father."
Parenting style in hood and mortality risk at older ages: a longitudinal cohort study,2016,"Background   is associated with offspring health, but whether it is associated with offspring mortality at older ages remains unknown. Aims We examined whether hood experiences of suboptimal   are associated with increased risk of death at older ages. Method Longitudinal cohort  of 1964 community-dwelling adults aged 65-79 years. Results The association between   and mortality was inverse and graded. Participants in the poorest   score quartile had increased risk of death (hazard ratio (HR)= 1.72, 95% CI 1.20-2.48) compared with those in the optimal   score quartile after adjustment for age and gender. Full adjustment for covariates partially explained this association (HR=1.49, 95% CI 1.02-2.18).   was inversely associated with cancer and other mortality, but not cardiovascular mortality. Maternal and paternal   were individually associated with mortality. Conclusions Experiences of suboptimal  in hood are associated with increased risk of death at older ages."

Maternal Positive Parenting Style is Associated with Better Functioning in Hyperactive/Inattentive Preschool Children,2011,"Many preschoolers are highly inattentive, impulsive, and hyperactive; but only some are impaired in their functioning. Yet factors leading to functional impairment, above and beyond the severity of inattentive and hyperactive symptoms, have not been systematically examined. This  examined a model suggesting that after controlling for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptom severity,  temperament is uniquely associated with  stress; that  stress affects  , above and beyond  characteristics; that   is related to the level of  impairment, above and beyond the effects of  symptoms, temperament, and  stress; and finally that   moderates the relationship between ADHD symptom severity and  functioning. Child measures included -and teacher-rated ADHD symptom severity, teacher-rated temperament, and clinician-rated functioning in a sample of 138 inattentive/hyperactive preschoolers. Maternal self-ratings of   and  stress were obtained. Analyses indicated that, after controlling for symptom severity,  temperament was related to maternal  stress, which was additionally related to both maternal   and  functioning. Maternal positive   moderated the relationship between ADHD symptom severity and  impairment, indicating that a positive   plays a protective role in the functioning of hyperactive/inattentive preschoolers.

Parental Styles and Parental Emotional Intelligence as Predictors of Challenging Behavior Problems Among Children in Israel,2022,"We examined whether two facets of preschool 's home environment,   and al emotional intelligence, may be risk factors for challenging behaviors among kindergarten  in Arab society in Israel. We sampled 524 s for  aged 4 to 5 years who completed questionnaires about their  , emotional intelligence, and their 's behavior. Teachers  reported on the 's challenging behaviors to increase reliability. The findings revealed that authoritarian (high demandingness, low warmth) and uninvolved (low demandingness, low warmth)   and low al emotional intelligence were associated with greater challenging behaviors in  (both  and teacher reports). Notably, authoritative (high demandingness, high warmth)   was related to fewer challenging behaviors in , suggesting that this may be a protective factor for .

"Cyber-aggression in adolescence and internet parenting styles: A study with victims, perpetrators and victim-perpetrators",2018,"Cyber-aggression is the new form of interpersonal violence among adolescents. This  examines the prevalence of cyber-aggression and its differentiation in terms of adolescents' sociodemographic characteristics and digital practices, as well as   experienced by four groups: non-violent, victim, perpetrator and victim-perpetrator Finally, we add an in-depth view of the predictors of becoming double involved. A sample of 627 adolescents (12- to 16-years-old) from schools in northern Portugal and the Azores answered two questionnaires. The  show that 63.1% reported being involved in cyber-aggression, with 31.1% admitting to being victim-perpetrators. Adolescent girls and younger adolescents, both girls and boys, characterized the nonviolent and victims' groups, whereas the perpetrators and victim-perpetrators groups were characterized by adolescent boys and older adolescents, both boys and girls. A higher frequency of information and communication technology use and cyber-practices/risks were associated with victim-perpetrators. Further, individuals in the non-violent group were more likely to perceive their s'   as authoritative and authoritarian and victim-perpetrators as permissive and laissez-faire. Additionally, laissez-faire  affects adolescents' cyber-involvement. This relationship is, however, mediated by the frequency of adolescents' cyber-practices/risks. Calling without justification, sending exaggerated messages of affection, sending insulting messages and sending pornographic images or messages were the most prevalent behaviours among the victim-perpetrators. Victimization-perpetration increased when adolescents published personal information, consulted erotic websites or arranged offline meetings with someone whom they had met online only. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."
Parenting styles and academic achievement of early adolescent girls in Iran: mediating roles of parent involvement and self-regulated learning,2020,"Early adolescent girls' (6th grade) academic achievement was examined using   as predictors and  involvement and early adolescents' self-regulated learning (SRL) as mediators. Participants were 341 early adolescents, 341 mothers, and 20 teachers (N = 702) among all middle schools of Bojnord, Iran?recruited using cluster, multistage sampling. Early adolescents completed the Self-Regulation Questionnaire for School Activities (SRQ), mothers completed the al Authority Questionnaire (PAQ) and  Involvement in School Activities Questionnaire (PISAQ), and teachers reported early adolescents' academic achievement. Authoritative ,  involvement, and SRL altogether explained 36% of the variance in early adolescents' academic achievement. Authoritative  and  involvement explained 26% of the variance in early adolescents' SRL. Authoritative  was positively related to academic achievement, whereas authoritarian and permissive  were not. Authoritative  related positively and significantly to early adolescents' academic achievement through increased SRL and al involvement in early adolescents' academic life. Although al involvement was better than noninvolvement, the positive link between al involvement and early adolescents' academic achievement depended on the quality of  . Authoritative s' involvement was positively and significantly related to early adolescents' academic achievement, whereas authoritarian and permissive s' involvement were nonsignificant. These findings were contrary to arguments regarding the positive relations between authoritarian  and academic achievement in collectivist cultures. Autonomous self-regulatory learning capacities were central to academic achievement for early adolescents in Iran?lending support to the proposition that independence, self-reliance, and individual initiative are necessary for developmental progress in cultures assumed to be collectivistic."
Front-line social work jobs and secondary trauma: Impact on parenting,2020,"This nonrandom pre-experimental posttest only group design  sought to examine levels of secondary trauma in social work professionals and the impact of this trauma on  behavior. Participants (n = 421) completed measures focused on demographic data and normed scales in the areas of primary trauma, secondary trauma, and  . Results noted moderate levels of primary trauma and low moderate levels of secondary trauma. A negative correlation was noted between years of service and overall secondary trauma. Child Protective Services Workers (CPS) were noted to report an increased likelihood of primary and secondary trauma compared to the rest of the sample. Overall, a positive correlation was noted between secondary trauma and authoritarian , and, conversely, a negative correlation was noted between secondary trauma and authoritative . A smaller but significant finding was noted in high secondary trauma and permissive . This information is important for teaching and training opportunities to educate social workers and other paraprofessionals on the impact of secondary trauma on  behaviors. Awareness can lead to personal changes, as well as changes in curriculum to support prevention efforts."
Maternal psychosocial predictors of controlling parental feeding styles and practices,2009,"The aim of the current  was to explore the relative contribution of al depression, anxiety and stress and  satisfaction and efficacy to the explanation of variance in controlling al feeding  and practices.

The relationship between perceived parenting styles and resilience during adolescence,2005,"Objective - The aim of this  was to investigate the relationship between perceived   and resilience in adolescence. Method - The respondents were a sample of 360 English speaking subjects, with a mean age of 17.6 years. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to investigate this relationship. The criterion variables included sense of coherence and problem-focused, emotion-focused and dysfunctional coping strategies. The predictor variables included six scales. Results - Authoritative  provided the most significant contribution to the explanation of the variance in resilience for black and white adolescents, and both genders. Surprisingly, the findings suggest that there is a positive relationship between fathers' authoritarian  and emotion-focused coping strategies in white adolescent learners. In contrast, other ers found that authoritarian and harsh al  are closely related to psychological disturbance. Conclusions - The identified relationships between the criterion and predictor variables found in this  for both black and white adolescents of both genders have distinct and far-reaching implications for envisaged interventions. A future  might  investigate the   qualitatively. Further  will be necessary to enhance and develop appropriate   that facilitate resilience in adolescent .

Participants were 840 Secondary School students, aged 12 to 16. A cluster analysis was performed in order to obtain the   of both mothers and fathers. Results showed that  reported lower levels of stress when assigning an authoritative  to both s. Consistency in the  of both s reduces stress over inconsistent settings. The presence of an authoritative father in the family was associated with lower perceived stress. However, the fact that one  develops an authoritative  did not seem to be enough, but this  depended on the  developed by the other partner."
Democratic Parenting Beliefs and Observed Parental Sensitivity: Reciprocal Influences Between Coparents,2016,"Three hundred sixty-five 2- families from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development were rated by trained observers on their  behavior at 6 assessments ranging from 6 months after the 's birth to when the  was in fifth grade (M = 10.4 years old at fifth grade). Across assessments, s reported on their  beliefs and mothers reported on the 's externalizing behavior problems.  beliefs predicted change in  behavior, and to a lesser degree  behavior predicted change in  beliefs.  behavior and  beliefs both showed reciprocal effects between cos, after controlling for  externalizing behavior and  education."

For the developmental milestone expectations, similar age expectations for self-care, emotional control and environmental independence were shared. Indian s had relatively delayed age expectations for compliance, peer interaction and communication and a later age expectation than the Malay caregivers for education. These later age expectations reflect the relaxed, indulgent view of rearing held by caregivers from an Indian background.

The influence of maternal psychosocial characteristics on infant feeding styles,2016,"Maternal feeding  in infancy and early hood are associated with 's later risk for overweight and obesity. Maternal psychosocial factors that influence feeding  during the complementary feeding period, the time during which infants transition from a milk-based diet to one that includes solid foods and other non-milk products, have received less attention. The   explores how maternal psychosocial factors specifically self-esteem,  self-efficacy,  satisfaction, and depression symptoms influence mothers' infant feeding  at nine months of age, a time during which solid foods eating habits are being established. Participants included 160 low-income, African-American mother-infant pairs in central North Carolina who were enrolled in the Infant Care and Risk of Obesity Study. Regression models tested for associations between maternal psychosocial characteristics and pressuring and restrictive feeding . Models were first adjusted for maternal age, education, marital status and obesity status. To account for infant characteristics, models were then adjusted for infant weight-for-length, distress to limitations and activity level scores. Maternal self-esteem was negatively associated with pressuring to soothe. Maternal  self-efficacy was positively associated with restriction-diet quality. Maternal  satisfaction and depression symptoms were not associated with feeding  in the final models. Focusing on strengthening maternal self-esteem and  self-efficacy may help to prevent the development of less desirable infant feeding . (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Parenting styles and mental health of Arab gifted adolescents,2004,"This  examined the al  and psychosocial adjustment of adolescents and the relationship between them in gifted as compared to non-gifted Arab adolescents. Five scales-The al Authority Questionnaire. Child Attitude Toward s, Lipsitt's Self-Concept Scale for Children, Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, and the Psychological State Scale-were administered to 118 gifted and 115 nongifted Arab adolescents in Isreal. Results indicate that s of gifted adolescents tend to be more authoritarive and less authoritarian then s of nongifted adolescents. The attitudes of the gifted adolescents their s were more positive than those of the nongifted adolescents. The gifted displayed higher self-esteem and fewer identity disorders, phobias, and conduct disorders than the nongifted adolescents. The authoritative al  correlates positively with the mental health of both gifted and nongifted adolescents, while the authoritarian  impacts negatively on the mental health of the gifted, but not of the nongifted adolescents. The   indicate that the authoritarian   is a crucial factor that influences the well-being of gifted  and may affect their psychological adjustment. More studies are needed among gifted underachievers and among eminent Arab writers and artists."
Extending transformational leadership theory to parenting and adolescent health behaviours: an integrative and theoretical review,2010," is a critical social determinant of the health-related behaviours of adolescents. In this article, we argue that extending transformational leadership theory to  s an opportunity for developing a useful conceptual model for (a) understanding the relationships between  and adolescents' health behaviours and (b) supporting the development of  interventions. First, we provide a brief review of the extant literature on   and practices as it relates to adolescent health. Second, after drawing parallels between s and leaders, we provide a synopsis of transformational leadership theory, and explain the conceptual utility of this framework for understanding and evaluating  behaviours. Third, we draw from the leadership and behavioural medicine literatures to outline potential psychological mechanisms through which transformational  might predict adolescent health-related behaviours. We conclude by discussing opportunities for the implementation of evidence-based transformational  intervention  designed to support  behaviours."
The relationship between parenting factors and trait anxiety: Mediating role of cognitive errors and metacognition,2008,"Research examining  factors in the development of anxiety has focused largely on the concepts of al warmth and overcontrolling or intrusive , This  investigated the relationship between these factors, and  al discipline  and anxiety using self-report methodology with a sample of 16-18 year olds. In order to try to explain the relationship between  and anxiety, measures of cognition were  included. A multiple regression was conducted including all  factors as predictors of trait anxiety. The regression was a modest fit (R-2 = 22%) and the model was significant (F(4, 141) = 9.90, p < 0.0001). Only the effect of Over-reactivity was significant, (t = 3.72, p < 0.0001). Furthermore, Over-reactive discipline was significantly associated with increased cognitive distortions (r = 0.361 p < 0.0001) and metacognition (r = 0.396p < 0.0001). Both cognitive distortions and metacognition were found to partially mediate the relationship between discipline  and trait anxiety.

Parenting style and aggression in Chinese undergraduates with left-behind experience: The mediating role of inferiority,2021,"Many Chinese college students have left-behind experience, as they stayed in hometown during hood while their s migrated to other regions for work. Previous studies have found that college students with leftbehind experience usually  high-level aggression. In order to examine the relationship between   and aggression in college students with left-behind experience, and to explore the mediating role of inferiority, two hundred and ninety-six Chinese college students with left-behind experience were recruited and completed survey questionnaires at two time points. Specifically,   and aggression were assessed at the first time point. After 6 months, inferiority and aggression were assessed again. Results showed that feeling of inferiority meditated the contributions of paternal care and maternal control at T1 to the aggression behaviour at T2 of college students with left-behind experience, after controlling for prior aggression at T1. These findings indicate that among college students with left-behind experience, maternal control is a risk factor of aggression, and paternal care is a protective factor of aggression. In addition, high level of maternal control and low level of paternal care may increase aggression behaviour by increasing the level of feeling of inferiority among this population."
The influence of parenting style and mother's mental health from mental health in  who have siblings with autism,2021,"Background: Mental health is a good emotional and psychological state.

Differential Susceptibility or Diathesis-Stress: Testing the Moderating Role of Temperament and Cortisol Levels between Fathers' Parenting and Children's Aggressive Behavior,2021,"Aggression is a multidimensional behavior that could be caused by different biopsychosocial variables. The aim of this  was to explore whether temperament, cortisol and sex moderate the relation between fathers'   and aggressive behavior in school-aged , and whether this corresponds to differential susceptibility or diathesis-stress. Participants were 158  (88 boys and 70 girls) aged 8 years. Aggressive behavior was measured using the Direct and Indirect Aggression Scale and fathers informed about their 's temperament and their own   through the Children's Behavior Questionnaire and the  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire (respectively). Children's' baseline saliva cortisol levels were analyzed through an enzyme immunoassay technique. The  revealed that high cortisol levels moderated the relation between fathers' low levels of authoritative  and boys' aggression. Moreover, high negative emotionality moderated the relation between permissive paternal  and girls' aggressive behavior, with both these relations being consistent with the diathesis-stress theory."
"Attachment, parental styles and empathy in adolescent",2019,"The aim of this investigation was to  the relationship among the perception of attachment,  relationships, and emotional and cognitive aspects of empathy in a group of adolescents. In order to measure adolescents' perception of the relationship with their s we used the formats for mother and father of the Argentinean adaptations: (1) Kerns' safety scale, and (2) the abbreviated version of the Children's Report on  Behavior (CRPBI); subscales: acceptance, pathological control and extreme autonomy. The Argentine validation of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (cognitive component: Taking Perspective and Fantasy, emotional component: Empathic Concern and Personal Distress) was used as the empathy measure. Considering the total score obtained on the Kerns safety scale, respect to the maternal and paternal figures, high attachment perception groups (mean >= + 1 SD) and low attachment perception groups (mean <= - 1 SD) were formed. Correlations between al  and empathy with the Spearman test were evaluated. Mean comparisons were made with the Mann Whitney U test: on the one hand, between gender and empathy; on the other, among adolescents who perceived a low and high attachment with both s in relation with empathy and al . Males reported lower total IRI scores in the subscales: fantasy, empathic concern and personal distress (respectively: p <= .001; p <= .001; p <= .001; p <= .001) as compared to adolescent women. The females that experienced a high attachment towards their s perceived higher acceptance rate in the relationship with them (p <= .001; p <= .001). They  showed higher empathy (p = .018; p =.016) and obtained higher scores in the dimensions of the IRI: perspective taking (p <= .001; p = .006) and empathic concern (p = .024; p = .022). The adolescents who perceived a more tolerant   showed themselves more empathic (p = .008; p = .001). In addition, the al  of extreme autonomy with their mother and their father was negatively associated with the total scores of the IRI (p = .006, p <= .001), fantasy (p = .011; p = .017) and empathic concern (p <= .001; p <= .001). s with less years of schooling use  practices based on punitive and coercive control. The female gender was characterized by an empathic emotional response, although both genders have a similar cognitive ability to understand or take the perspective of the other. However, women react more affectively. These differences can be attributed to socialization stereotyped patterns of male and female  that assign to women greater emotional sensitivity. Experiencing a secure attachment in adolescence may depend on perceiving an interpersonal relationship with s based on the acceptance of their individuality and positive involvement. These  match with several investigations, which show that s perceived as available and with democratic  , based on the acceptance of adolescents, establish with their  a secure attachment bond, which is associated with a greater psychosocial adjustment. Experiencing a relationship based on acceptance, on affective and committed reciprocity with significant adults that show first empathy and emotional attunement with their , is a requisite for adolescents to understand the perspective of others and identify with experience, to feel compassion and concern the discomfort of others. Establishing a secure attachment bond and perceiving acceptance as a al practice allows the development of empathy, protective factor of aggression and promoter of adolescent prosocial behavior."
Development and Validation of the Knowledge of Parenting Strategies Scale: Measuring Effective Parenting Strategies,2018,"The current  aimed to develop and evaluate a measure of  knowledge, the Knowledge of  Strategies Scale (KOPSS); specifically, to establish the scales internal reliability, ensure a clinically appropriate length, provide a community sample for future comparison, demonstrate adequate test-retest reliability and convergent validity, and to compare the scale to dysfunctional discipline . A total of n = 865 s were involved in the development and evaluation of the scale. In Study 1, data was collected from n = 229 s and Rasch analyses revealed seven items did not fit the measurement model. Study 2 involved a further sample of community families (n = 346) and revealed the scale could be further shortened to 16 items. Study 3 revealed the scale has good test-retest reliability over a one-week period (r = .88, p < .001). Study 4 demonstrated convergent validity through a comparison to the Knowledge of Effective  Scale (r = .583, p = .009). Study 5 utilised a sample of community families (n = 190), revealing the scale was negatively correlated with hostile and lax discipline (r = -.29, p < .001; r = -.15, p < .05). Lastly, Study 6 showed scores on the KOPSS significantly improved following clinic-based and Internet-based Behavioural  Training. The KOPSS was found to be a valid and reliable measure of  knowledge of effective  strategies, which can be used to evaluate knowledge acquisition in  programs, and test the role of knowledge in behaviour change."
Parental styles and indicators of physical activity in  and adolescents,2014,"This  analyzed the relationship between   and different variables associated to physical activity.

Children's perceptions related to physical activity were found to differ depending on the type of perceived  . Those  raised in permissive and authoritative homes were found to be more intrinsically motivated towards physical education than  raised in authoritarian and negligent homes. They  found the contents of the course more useful and reported to feel more supported by their s with regards to physical activity. Moreover, scores in task motivation approach, perceived physical competence, performance expectations, intrinsic motivation and utility of physical education, self-efficacy and al support were higher in elementary school students than in middle school students. No differences based on gender were found. It can be concluded that a more relaxed atmosphere in permissive and authoritative households may encourage a greater tendency to and deeper social values about physical activity."
A Longitudinal Study of Parenting Style and Child Weight with Moderation by American Indian Ethnicity,2019,"SYNOPSIS Objective: Early hood weight predicts later weight, so there is need for longitudinal  to identify key factors in the development of hood obesity, especially among vulnerable populations. Design: This  examines the links between   and  obesity across three waves (Mages?=?6.90, 7.34, and 8.28?years) and the moderating factor of mother ethnicity in a sample of 356  and their mothers (78.5% European American; 14.8% American Indian). Results: Growth curve SEM showed that high-permissive  predicted higher initial weight than the average permissive reference group and low permissive  group. Children of high authoritarian mothers began at a non-significantly different weight relative to the average authoritarian and low authoritarian reference groups, but later increased their weight, primarily from wave 1 to 2. An interaction between mother ethnicity and authoritative  was found for the autonomy granting subscale. Children of American Indian mothers with low levels of autonomy granting had the highest initial levels of weight compared to  of s in the average and high autonomy granting reference groups and by wave 3 had an average increase close to the cutoff for being overweight. Conclusions:   appears to play a role in predicting  weight longitudinally, and this relation is moderated by the ethnicity of the ?s mother. This  is  the first to show measurement invariance in the  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire among American Indian mothers."
Aggression and conduct disorder in former Soviet Union immigrant adolescents: The role of parenting style and ego identity,2011,"The  examined aggression, guilt feelings and conduct disorder (CD) in adolescent immigrants from the Former Soviet Union. One hundred and nineteen adolescents, including sixty six immigrants and fifty native Israelis from four residential schools, completed questionnaires assessing level of aggression, sense of guilt, ego identity, and  . Objective assessments of CD were obtained from instructors at the residential schools, using the CBCL. Results indicate that diffused ego identity is the strongest predictor of aggression, guilt, and CD. A lack of positive  moderates the link between diffused ego identity and aggression and CD, while positive  promotes a sense of guilt, especially in the immigrant group. These  warrant cultural identity-sensitive interventions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"ADOLESCENT PARENTING, IDENTIFICATION, AND MALADAPTIVE NARCISSISM",2015,"The presence of 2 types of maladaptive narcissism-grandiose and vulnerable-was studied in a group of 23-year-olds and was related to the   of their mothers and their fathers when the 23-year-olds were 18. The role of the defense mechanism of identification was  studied. The findings showed that father's   was related to the presence of grandiose narcissism at age 23, whereas mother's   was related to vulnerable narcissism. In both cases,  involving responsiveness and permissiveness was related to lower narcissism scores, whereas authoritarian  was related to higher levels of narcissism, as was indifferent  on the part of the father. In addition, participant sex interacted with the defense of identification in predicting narcissism."
"Parenting Style, Familism, and Youth Adjustment in Mexican American and European American Families",2019,"Authoritative  is typically considered the gold-standard  approach based on studies with largely European American (EA) samples. The current  evaluated a novel, no-nonsense   in Mexican American (MA) and EA families, not captured by traditional classifications.   of mothers and fathers, cultural values, and youth internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed in 179 MA (n = 84) and EA (n = 95) s and adolescents across 2 years (seventh to ninth grade). MA families showed a higher proportion of no-nonsense , characterized by high levels of acceptance as well as harsh discipline and rejection, compared with EA families. Cultural values influenced the link between   and youth outcomes across ethnicity such that when s endorsed low adherence to familismo values, authoritative  predicted lower youth internalizing and externalizing problems compared with the no-nonsense . Yet when s endorsed strong adherence to familismo values, the authoritative and no-nonsense  functioned similarly. Findings have implications for the development of culturally competent  interventions that may lead to positive outcomes in youth from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds."
Theory of mind at home: linking authoritative and authoritarian parenting styles to 's social understanding,2014,"Building on Vinden's pioneering  [(2001).  attitudes and 's understanding of mind: A comparison of Korean American and Anglo-American families. Cognitive Development, 16, 793-809], we examined how s' use of authoritative versus authoritarian  of discipline related to their 's development of theory of mind (ToM). ToM was assessed using standard false belief tests and a developmental ToM Scale [Wellman, H. M., & Liu, D. (2004). Scaling of theory-of-mind tasks. Child Development, 75(2), 523-541] comprising five reliably sequential steps of ToM understanding from awareness of others' desires through false belief to the recognition of hidden emotion that even 8year-olds often have difficulty with. In contrast to previous largely null , our  from a sample of 30 Anglo-Australian  aged 5-12 years and their 30 s showed, for the first time, that there are significant negative links of  ToM with al authoritarianism and significant positive links, independent of  age and language skill, between ToM understanding and authoritative . These  contribute to a growing body of  on how family processes interconnect with 's social understanding and social adjustment."
Parental Expressivity and Parenting Styles in Chinese Families: Prospective and Unique Relations to Children's Psychological Adjustment,2011,"Objectives. s from different cultures differ in how frequently they express emotions. However, the generalizability of the relations between al expressivity and  adjustment in non-Western cultures has not been extensively studied. The authors investigated prospective relations between al expressivity within the family (positive, negative dominant, and negative submissive expressivity) and Chinese 's psychological adjustment, above and beyond  . Design. The  used 2 waves (3.8 years apart) of longitudinal data from a sample (n = 425) of  in Beijing (mean ages = 7.7 years at T1 and 11.6 years at T2). al expressivity and   were self-reported. To reduce the potential measurement overlap, items that tap al expression of emotions toward the  were removed from the   measure. The authors measured 's adjustment with s', teachers', and peers' or 's reports. Results. Consistent with findings with European American samples, al negative dominant expressivity uniquely and positively predicted Chinese 's externalizing problems controlling for prior externalizing problems,  , and family socioeconomic status. Neither al expressivity nor   uniquely predicted social competence. Conclusions. Despite previously reported cultural differences in the mean levels of al expressivity, some of the socialization functions of al expressivity found in Western countries can be generalized to Chinese families. Although al expressivity and   are related constructs, their unique relations to 's adjustment suggest that they should be examined as distinct processes."

Parenting and behaviour problem among preschoolers,1998,"The  aimed at examining  and behavioural problems, among preschoolers. A sample of 26 boys and 24 girls in the age group of 4-6 years, who had 6 months of schooling and were staging with their s was taken. Mother's report was obtained on (1) General Information Schedule (2) Preschool behaviour Checklist (PBCL) (3) Disciplining Style Interview (4)  Practices Questionnaire - Mother's from (5) Brigance Basic Skill Inventory, Results revealed that  pattern was that of high authoritativeness, and low permissiveness. Disciplining  was power assertive. Prevalence rate of behavioural problems was 12%. s power assertiveness was associated with greater behavioural problems. There was no significant relationship between dimensions of  (Authoritative authoritarian and permissive) and behavioural problems."
The role of perceived parenting in familial aggregation of anxiety disorders in ,2009,"This  was designed to explore the role of perceived   in the familial aggregation of anxiety disorders. We examined the association between al and  anxiety diagnoses, and tested whether this association was partly due to a perceived  . The  was conducted in a clinical sample as well as in a control sample. al lifetime and Current anxiety diagnoses were significantly associated with  anxiety diagnoses. When maternal and paternal lifetime and Current anxiety diagnoses were entered as separate predictors, only maternal current anxiety diagnoses appeared to be significant. Perceived   was assessed with the dimensions overprotection emotional warmth, rejection, and anxious rearing. Results indicated that only maternal and paternal 'overprotection' was significantly but negatively associated with  anxiety. However, further analyses showed that 'overprotection' did not have a significant mediating role in the familial aggregation of anxiety disorders. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Daycare Center Attendance Buffers the Effects of Maternal Authoritarian Parenting Style on Physical Aggression in Children,2017,"A maternal authoritarian  has been related to the development of physical aggression during hood and later future social problems; however, not too many studies have detected other than individual or family factors that may buffer this maternal effect. This work examines whether daycare center attendance may moderate the relationships between a mother authoritarian  and physical aggression. The  sample was 72 (40 girls) kindergarten  from Spain. s were asked to complete two questionnaires focused on individual family characteristics and  . At age 5,  physical aggression was assessed by direct observation at playtime; aggression scores at 6 was obtained by a peer-rated questionnaire. A least squared multiple regression was performed after controlling for 's level of physical aggression at 5,  sex and siblings. A positive contribution of maternal authoritarian  on physical aggression was detected. Daycare center attendance appears to attenuate the effect of the mother's authoritarian  on physical aggression, only in boys."
Maternal parenting styles and mother- relationship among adolescents with and without persistent attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,2013,"We investigated mothering and mother- interactions in adolescents with and without persistent attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a sample of 190 adolescents with persistent DSM-IV ADHD, 147 without persistent ADHD, and 223 without ADHD. Both participants and their mothers received psychiatric interviews for diagnosis of ADHD and other mental disorders; and reported on the al Bonding Instrument about mother's  , the Social Adjustment Inventory for Children and Adolescents for interactions with mothers and home behavioral problems. The mothers  reported on their ADHD and neurotic/depressive symptoms. Our  based on both informants showed that both ADHD groups obtained less affection/care and more overprotection and control from the mothers, and perceived less family support than those without ADHD. Child's inattention and comorbidity, and maternal depression were significantly correlated with decreased maternal affection/care and increased maternal controls; 's hyperactivity-impulsivity and maternal neurotic trait were significantly correlated with maternal overprotection; and 's inattention and comorbidity, and maternal neurotic/depressive symptoms were significantly correlated with impaired mother- interactions and less family support. Our findings suggested that, regardless of persistence, hood ADHD diagnosis, particularly inattention symptoms and comorbidity, combining with maternal neurotic/depressive symptoms was associated with impaired maternal process.

Parenting styles as a tobacco-use protective factor among Brazilian adolescents,2015,"The objective was to evaluate the relationship between tobacco use (previous month and frequent use),   and al smoking behavior in a sample of high school students. Participants were recruited from public and private high schools from 27 Brazilian state capitals (N=17,246). The overall prevalence of tobacco use in life was 25.2%; 15.3% in the previous year; 8.6% in the previous month; and 3.2% for frequent use. Tobacco use by the s was reported by 28.6% of the students. Regarding  , 39.2% were classified as negligent, 33.3% authoritative, 15.6% as indulgent and 11.9% authoritarian. Compared to adolescents with authoritative s, those with negligent or indulgent s were more prone to report tobacco use during the last month or frequent use. This  showed an association between   and tobacco use by high school students. Authoritative s were associated with protection from frequent and previous month tobacco use among adolescents."
Difference in parenting style between African American alcoholic and nonalcoholic parents,2002,"This  set out to investigate differences in   to which  of alcoholics (COAs) were subjected as opposed to the  of nonalcoholics (non-COAs) in a sample of 1,000 African American adolescent males aged 13 to 17 living in a Midwestern city. Data were gathered using the Children of Alcoholics Screening Test (CAST) and the Children's Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism (C-SAGA) specifically in its subsections which deal with 's time spent with the , discipline in the home, adults as role models, and family rules. Following the Baumrind categorization, of   as authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive, a composite index was constructed which discriminated the  between those who were subjected to a more authoritative (strict but warm discipline)   and those who were not. Results showed that the COAs were associated with less favorable outcomes than the non-COAs in every aspect of the comparison. Implications for social service are suggested."
Parent-Child Interaction Styles Between Gay and Lesbian Parents and Their Adopted Children,2007,"While myths exist that call into question the  ability of gay and lesbian s as well as the impact of such  on  in their care, there is an ever increasing body of literature that clearly demonstrates the capabilities of these s with their birth . However, there continues to be a dearth of  on gay and lesbian adoptive s and their . To address this deficiency in the literature, this article explores the   of gay and lesbian adoptive s and strengths of their  between the ages of 5-9 years (N = 94), using scores from the -as-a-Teacher Inventory and the Behavioral and Emotional Rating Scale. Results illustrate that the gay and lesbian adoptive s in this sample fell into the desirable range of the  scale and their  have strength levels equal to or exceeding the scale norms. Finally, various aspects of   significantly predicted the adoptive s' view of their 's level of care difficulty which subsequently predicted the type and level of strengths assessed within their adopted .

Differential parenting between mothers and fathers - Implications for late adolescents,2008,"Although the relationship between  and outcomes for  and adolescents has been examined, differences between maternal and paternal   have received less attention, particularly in the case of late adolescents. As a , this article examines the relationship between late adolescents' perceptions of their mothers' and fathers'   and their own emotional adjustment. Findings of this  suggest that mothers and fathers use different   for their sons and daughters. It  suggests that different combinations of maternal and paternal  (e.g., a permissive father  with an authoritarian mother) are related to late adolescents' emotional adjustment, with late adolescents who have at least one authoritative  showing better adjustment than those who do not have such a . Overall, this  emphasizes the importance of examining dyadic -adolescent relationships, and it suggests that having one authoritative  may be a protective factor for late adolescents."
"Family Systems Thinking as a Guide for Theory Integration: Conceptual Overlaps of Differentiation, Attachment, Parenting Style, and Identity Development in Families With Adolescents",2019,"There is both the necessity and the capacity for unification across the discipline of family science. This article offers another step toward a comprehensive, integrated body of theory and  shared across our discipline. Specifically, we address how family systems thinking has been reflected in attachment, , and adolescent identity literature, and we  bidimensional models and integrated spectrums emphasizing how levels of differentiation, adolescent internal working models of attachment,  , and adolescent identity statuses are conceptually intertwined as systemic intrapsychic and interpersonal processes. These theories and concepts, when considered as an integrated whole, invite theoretical complexity that advances the understanding of family processes and guides new  questions. We propose that family systems theory is a holistic framework that is ideal for integrating these concepts in a way that goes beyond highlighting their common factors. We conclude with the benefits and barriers to comprehensive integration across family science."
"PERCEIVED NEIGHBORHOOD VIOLENCE, PARENTING STYLES, AND DEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOMES AMONG SPANISH ADOLESCENTS",2012,"This article analyzed perceptions of neighborhood violence of Spanish adolescents (N = 1,015) from authoritative, authoritarian, indulgent, and neglectful families, and its association with three sets of developmental outcomes (psychological, behavioral, and academic). Tests of main and interactive effects were conducted to answer  questions regarding the potential moderating role of perceived neighborhood violence on the relationship between   and developmental outcomes. Results yielded only main effects of   and perceived neighborhood violence on developmental outcomes, as well as an interaction between gender and perceived neighborhood violence.   and perceived neighborhood violence made an independent contribution to adolescent outcomes. Adolescents from authoritative and indulgent families were those who performed better in all developmental domains examined, and adolescents who perceived their neighborhoods as violent performed worse in all outcomes. Results suggested, however, that irrespective of al behavior, perceived neighborhood violence was a developmental risk in adolescence."
Differential parenting styles for fathers and mothers: Differential treatment for sons and daughters,2001,"University students (N = 617; 242 male, 375 female) completed a questionnaire designed to tap attitudes toward paternal and maternal . Significant gender-based differences were found for the authoritative anal permissive  of . Mothers, rather than fathers, were perceived to be more likely to use these . When considering the extent to which s differentiated between their suns and daughters, significant differences were found for each of the three  . Fathers were perceived by male respondents to be more likely to use an authoritarian . Mothers were perceived to be more likely to use an authoritative  by female respondents, and a permissive  by male respondents. Some of the socialisation implications stemming from these gender-based differences are discussed, particularly with regard to aggressiveness."

The aim of the paper is threefold: understand (1) how are social legitimations for or against 's use of smartphones constructed; (2) how do s make sense of their mediation of 's mobile internet use drawing on different interpretative repertoires; and (3) how  negotiate, resist or evade al justifications by producing alternative narratives."
Psychometric Properties of Parenting Measures in Indonesia,2018,"We examined the psychometric properties of two  measures, the  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ) and the -Child Relationships Questionnaire (PCRQ) which were translated into Indonesian for use in Indonesia. The Indonesian versions of these questionnaires were completed by 514 s and 459 s, respectively. Participants were s (mostly mothers) of typically developing , who completed the measures through an online or paper-based survey. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), parallel analyses, internal and external construct validity, and internal reliability were performed on both measures. Results revealed that the translated version of the PSDQ consisted of three factors. Two of these factors reflected the Authoritative and Authoritarian subscales of the original measure; however, the Permissive subscale was not obtained. A third factor, labelled Reasoning, was extracted. The translated PCRQ was found to have the same structure as the original version of the measure. Some modifications were required for both instruments, and the modified versions of the instruments had acceptable internal consistency. Development of these translated and modified instruments will support   within Indonesia."
Role of parenting styles in adolescent substance use:  from a Swedish longitudinal cohort study,2016,"Objective: Adolescent substance use is an area of concern because early substance use is associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes.  , defined as the general  of , as well as substance-specific  practices may influence 's substance use behaviour. The   aims to probe the impact of   on adolescent substance use. Method: A cohort of 1268 adolescents (48% girls), aged 12-13 years at baseline, from 21 junior high schools was assessed in the first semester of junior high school, and then again in the last semester of the 9th grade, 32 months later.  , operationalised as a fourfold classification of  , including established risk factors for adolescent substance use, were measured at baseline. Results: Neglectful   was associated with worse substance use outcomes across all substances. After adjusting for other proximal risk factors in multivariate analyses,   was found to be unrelated to substance use outcomes with one exception: authoritative   was associated with less frequent drinking. Association with deviant peers, delinquent behaviour, provision of alcohol by s, and previous use of other substances were associated with substance use outcomes at follow-up. Conclusions: The  of the   indicate that   may be less important for adolescent substance use outcomes than what has previously been assumed, and that association with deviant peers and delinquent behaviour may be more important for adolescent substance use outcomes than general  ."
Parenting: Psychometric analysis of two studies in Spanish population,2015,"  set the pace and quality of - relationships and  practices.

The analysis checks the typology and  of , bearing in mind both s in a differentiated way. The first  involved 762 adolescents of 12-17 years (mean age=13.69 y SD=1.40; 52.7% boys). A total of 824  of 8-11 years participated in the second  (mean age=9.28 y SD=1.34; 47.8% boys). The  of the exploratory and confirmatory factorial analyses show a four-factor model: Support and communications, Negative psychological control, Permissiveness, and Negligence, for both the mother and the father, which determine  from the 's perception. The fit indexes are within the established limits to consider this an appropriate questionnaire to assess   in hood and adolescence in Spanish populations."
The psychology of Vietnamese tiger mothers: Qualitative insights into the parenting beliefs and practices of Vietnamese-Australian mothers,2014,"To remedy the obscurity in perceptions linked with the Tiger mother phenomenon, and the dearth of  within immigrant-Asian subgroups, we attempted to provide an exploratory analysis on the  beliefs and practices of Vietnamese mothers. The voices of seven immigrant Vietnamese-Australian mothers from Western Australia were ed through Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis. The emergent themes revealed the development of a bi-cultural identity, education, respect, and al control. Moreover, we found that many beliefs and practices hinge upon the cultural concepts of filial piety and Confucianism. Our findings  support the growing concern which suggest that   under Baumrinde (1971) typology are inaccurate for cross-cultural populations. Implications pertaining to culturally competent practice and directions for future  are discussed."
The role of parenting styles in 's problem behavior,2005,"This  investigated the combination of mothers' and fathers'   (affection, behavioral control, and psychological control) that would be most influential in predicting their 's internal and external problem behaviors. A total of 196  (aged 5-6 years) were followed up six times from kindergarten to the second grade to measure their problem behaviors. Mothers and fathers filled in a questionnaire measuring their   once every year. The  showed that a high level of psychological control exercised by mothers combined with high affection predicted increases in the levels of both internal and external problem behaviors among . Behavioral control exercised by mothers decreased 's external problem behavior but only when combined with a low level of psychological control."
Children's responses to low parental mood. II: Associations with family perceptions of parenting styles and  distress,2002,"Objective: In an earlier article (part I) the authors identified four patterns of 's responses to al low mood: Active Empathy, Emotional Overinvolvement, Indifference, and Avoidance. They then hypothesized that these response patterns were related to   and to discrepancies in family members' perceptions of  and  mental distress. Method: A normal population sample of 990 twelve-year-old Finnish  and their mothers (843) and fathers (573) was used. Within-family multivariate analyses conducted in mother-father- triads (470) were used to examine whether quality of  varied according to 's responses and whether s' and 's perceptions of  and  distress were different. Results: Children in the Active Empathy and Indifference groups experienced more positive  than those in the other two groups. Discrepancies in family members' perceptions of  distress and mothering and fathering were especially characteristic of the Emotional Overinvolvement group. Typical for the Avoidance group was a within-family agreement on poor  and severe  distress. Conclusions: Children's response patterns as regards al low mood are related to family dynamics. The  suggests that discrepancies in s' and 's perceptions of  and  distress can be meaningful in understanding family interactions and  development and well-being."
How Do Sport Parents Engage in Autonomy-Supportive Parenting in the Family Home Setting? A Theoretically Informed Qualitative Analysis,2021,"The purpose of this  was to identify and examine how sport s engage in autonomy-supportive  in the family home setting. A total of 44 s and  from 19 families were initially interviewed. Data from these families were profiled to identify seven families that adopted a highly autonomy-supportive  . The seven families' data were then examined using a theoretically focused qualitative analysis using the three dimensions of autonomy-supportive . Sport s engaged in autonomy support (vs. control) through flexible conversations and supporting decision making. The themes of boundary setting and establishing expectations based on values were indicative of structure. The authors found high levels of involvement across contexts. These findings depict the nature and types of social interactions in the family home that created an autonomy-supportive emotional climate, which often extended to sport, providing a foundation for future theoretical development and applied  in sport."
The impact of parenting style on fear of crime among adolescent girls and boys,2018,"Research on adolescent fear of crime is still relatively limited and often simply applies theoretical explanations proposed for adults. This  strives to extend current knowledge in this field by analyzing the impact of   on fear of crime, namely al attachment, al supervision, and al support of adolescent autonomy, while  considering possible gender differences. Using data from a self-report survey of approximately 1500 Czech adolescents, a hierarchical regression analysis is employed to examine these relationships while controlling for socio-demographic variables, environmental disorder, leisure time indicators, as well as victimization experience. The  suggest that higher al supervision and lower al support of adolescent autonomy are associated with increased fear of crime among adolescents. In addition, a gender-specific effect is found for al attachment which somewhat decreases fear of crime for boys and increases it for girls. Nevertheless, the overall impact of al indicators on fear of crime is relatively low. The implications and limitations of these findings are discussed."
The Role of Food Parenting Skills and the Home Food Environment in Children's Weight Gain and Obesity,2015,"This paper s an overview to provide readers with an update on the literature about the relation between al influences (general  and food  practices) and 's weight-related outcomes. It first summarizes the evidence regarding the role of food  practices in shaping and maintaining 's nutritional and weight status. It then describes empirical evidence on the relation between general  and 's weight status. This evidence is less convincing, possibly because general  has a different, more distal role in influencing  behavior than  practices. General  may moderate the impact of food  practices on 's nutrition behaviors. Finally, we discuss studies on interventions targeting hood overweight and obesity. There is no consensus on the optimal intervention targets (i.e., general  and/or food  practices). Based on the overview, we offer suggestions for future ."
"The relationship between the adolescents' exposure to peer victimization and their age, parental style and self-image",2006,"The objective of this  is to determine whether the age, the perceived   and the self-image of the individual contribute to his/her exposure peer victimization as well as to the prediction of the different types of peer victimization for both girls and boys. The sample of the  consists of 805 students: 381 girls and 484 boys, all of whom  at the second level of private primary education schools and high school's 6th, 7th, 9th and 10th grades in Istanbul. However, as some of the scales were not filled out properly, hence the sample size decreased to 314 and to 308 for boys and girls respectively. In the , 'The Peer Victimization Scale' to determine the level of their exposure to peer victimization, 'The  Style Scale' to identify, the perceived   of the subjects and 'The Offer Self-Image Scale' to reveal the self-images of the participants, were used as instruments for data assessing. Results show that the peer victimization both girls and boys encounter at school is significantly influenced by the age, the perceived   and the self-image of the individual. Findings are discussed within the framework of the related literature."
"Alcohol and Drug Use among Youth - The Interplay of Future Orientation, Parenting, and Housing Conditions",2019,"Background: Past  indicated that future orientation might protect against substance use; however, this potential had not yet been examined in the context of a multiple risk factor model that would include different   and indicators of the material situation. Additionally, past  draws primarily from a limited set of geographical regions, often using convenience samples of  and adolescents. Objectives: The current  addresses these issues by examining (in)direct relationships between substance use (alcohol, marijuana, hard drugs), future orientation, different   (authoritarian, authoritative, permissive), and family housing conditions, using a reative sample of Slovenian youth. Methods: Correlational and path analyses were used to test the proposed hypotheses. Additionally, possible mediating pathways were examined and evaluated. Results: Findings indicated a negative relation between future orientation and use of all substances. Next, future orientation fully mediated the effect of authoritative  on substance use. Finally, housing conditions had a direct and positive effect on authoritative , a direct and an indirect effect on future orientation and only an indirect (through authoritative  and future orientation) effect on substance use. Conclusions: Results, besides indicating the relevance of future orientation in understanding substance use among youth, highlight the importance of authoritative  (that spans beyond hood and adolescence) and housing conditions on the development of future orientation. In addition, findings highlight the importance of the material situation when examining antecedents of substance use among youth that might be missed if only direct effects are observed. Results are discussed in the context of the risk factor paradigm."
Contemporary Parenting and Its Association With Parents' Well-Being in the Face of COVID-19: The Mediating Role of Guilt,2022,"This  examines the association between the contemporary role of  and the well-being of its agent-the . In particular, I focus on al feelings of guilt as a mechanism underlying the association between   and difficulties to adjust to changing circumstances, in the face of COVID-19. The sample was recruited through social networks and included 382 Israeli s, mostly educated mothers (ages 23-57, average education 16.4 years) who reported being the primary caregiver in a committed relationship. All participants filled out online self-report questionnaires that addressed their  , al guilt feelings, and difficulties to adjust in the face of COVID-19. The analysis of these questionnaires indicated a significant direct association between hostile/coercive  and adjustment difficulties, and an indirect significant association between engaged/supportive  and adjustment difficulties through al guilt feelings. These findings are discussed in light of the Conservation of Resources Theory and in light of al contemporary social imperatives. Public Policy Relevance Statement Social imperatives that shape contemporary  force s to attempt to be the perfect s by intensively meeting their 's needs. This  emphasizes the toll that such  takes on its agents-the s-as it can provoke feelings of guilt that are associated with poor well-being."
Associations between Parenting Style and Mental Health in Children and Adolescents Aged 11-17 Years: Results of the KiGGS Cohort Study (Second Follow-Up),2021,"Few studies from Germany have investigated the associations between   and 's and adolescents' health. Little attention has been directed to whether these associations vary with familial socioeconomic or migration status. The aim of this analysis was to investigate the association between   and the mental health of  and adolescents aged 11-17 years using data from the KiGGS cohort  (second follow-up). We calculated mean Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) total difficulties scores stratified by   (authoritative, permissive, demanding-controlling, emotional distancing). Linear regression analyses adjusted for age, gender, socioeconomic status, migration status, and family status were performed. We  analyzed moderating effects of socioeconomic and migrations status on associations between   and SDQ scores. There were only small differences between the permissive and the authoritative  . Significantly higher mean scores were observed for the demanding-controlling and emotional distancing  for both the mother and father. These associations persisted after full adjustment and did not vary by socioeconomic or migration status.  behavior is an important predictor of 's and adolescents' mental health. The promotion of good relationships within families and improving  skills offer promising approaches for health promotion in young people."
"Domestic Violence, Parenting Styles and Well-being of German and Turkish Juveniles",2009,"This intercultural comparative  tries to identify the influences of domestic violence and   on juvenile violence and the well-being of juveniles. To this end, 304 German and 214 Turkish pupils in Berlin at the age of 13 to 16 completed a standardised questionnaire in their schools. The  show that Turkish juveniles report more barsh   than their German age-mates, but by controlling statistically the educational background of the s, these differences disappear. Nevertheless, as a stable finding, we can hold that Turkish s demand from their  a more cultural appropriate and disciplined behaviour. Furthermore, regarding the rates of juvenile violence, the main differences are seen in violence-legitimating attitudes and witnessing al violence in the Turkish group. Lastly, in the relations between   and violence, there seems to be no culturally different patterns, but more differences in the intensity of disadvantaging consequences of punishing and barsh  on the well-being of juveniles."
"The relationships between perceived parenting style, learning motivation, friendship satisfaction, and the addictive use of smartphones with elementary school students of South Korea: Using multivariate latent growth modeling",2015,"We examined how perceived  , friendship satisfaction, and academic motivation influence the addictive use of smartphones longitudinally. We utilized the panel data (from 2010-2012) of Korean  and youth panel survey of the National Youth Policy Institute. Data were collected from 2,376 individuals in the first year (boys: 1,241, girls: 1,135), 2264 individuals in the second year (boys: 1,180, girls: 1,084), and 2,218 individuals in the third year (boys: 1,167, girls: 1,051). Results of the multivariate latent growth modeling indicated that higher democratic  (warmth, supervisory, and rational explanation) was related to lower addictive use of smartphones. And, the more perceived democratic  was high, the more academic motivation and friendship satisfaction were high. Also, friendship satisfaction and academic motivation negatively influenced the addictive use of smartphones; the more friendship satisfaction and academic motivation increased rapidly over time, the more the addictive use of smartphones decreased over time. These  imply that affective and supervisory  can positively impact peer relationship and learning motivation, and the satisfaction of peer relationship and academic motivation can be protective factors for the addictive use of smartphones."
Continuity in Parenting Strategies: A Cross-Cultural Comparison,2010,"This prospective longitudinal  is aimed at contributing to the understanding of cultural diversity concerning maternal  behaviors and conversational  on one hand and continuity in  strategies on the other hand. It could be demonstrated that German middle-class families from Berlin and Indian Hindu middle-class families from Delhi re two different cultural environments embodying different  strategies. The Berlin mothers focus on the cultural model of independence, whereas the Delhi mothers focus on the cultural model of autonomous relatedness. These different orientations are expressed in nonverbal and conversational behaviors with 3-month-old babies as well as in the play  with 19-month-old toddlers. It could  be demonstrated that the   form continuous socialization environments. Especially the conversation  that mothers use while talking to their 3-month-old babies were good predictors for the play  with their 19-month-old toddlers. The  are discussed with an emphasis on  strategies as continuous and consistent cultural projects."
Examining the Internet Use Aim and Internet Parental Style of Primary School Students in Terms of Various Variables,2014,"The aim of the current  was to determine the Internet   within the families of primary school students and to find out whether their Internet use aims differed or not according to these . In addition, it was to determine whether the students' Internet use aims and their s' Internet  differed or not according to gender, grade, educational background of s, Internet connection at home, person from whom the students got help in case of a problem and person who warned the students in case of the Internet overuse. Cross-sectional survey model was used in the , conducted with 498 students in the second term of 2011-2012 school year, in a school in the centre of Sakarya. At the end of the , 65 families were found as laissez-faire, 144 families were considered as permissive, 255 families were recognised as authoritative, and 25 families revealed their authoritarian  . Results  indicated that the authoritative Internet   had an important role in different aims of the Internet use. A significant relationship between the Internet  , gender and grade was  discovered."
"Effects of a parenting education program on parenting skills, parenting stress, and mindfulness skills",2020,"Objective: To analyze the impact of the Adults and Children Together Raising Safe Kids (ACT-RSK) Program in  skills,  stress, and mindfulness skills in a group of s and . Methods: This investigative intervention was based on the application of a pre-test and a post-test before and after the implementation of the ACT-RSK Program. The program consisted of eight weekly 90-minute sessions conducted with a sample of 22 s from Central Portugal. The ACT-RSK Program questionnaires,  Stress Index (PSI), Interpersonal Mindfulness in  (IM-P) scale, and a socio-demographic questionnaire were used. A descriptive and inferential analysis (IMIcoxon) was conducted using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBM SPSS, v. 24) with a 95% confidence interval. Results: Participants showed improvement from pre-test to post-test in all four program dimensions:  Style (M=36.32 +/- 6.61 vs. M=48.50 +/- 4.31; p<0.01); Electronic Media (M=24.73 +/- 3.90 vs. M=30.73 +/- 2.90; p <= 0.01); Child Development (M=55.18 +/- 11.82 vs. M=73.55 +/- 4.04; p <= 0.01); and al Behavior (M=34.23 +/- 7.83 vs. M=43.05 +/- 2.81; p <= 0.01). Likewise, significant improvement was seen in the Interpersonal Mindfulness in  (IM-P) scale's  (Z=-3.929, p=0.000) and in  stress, which decreased from a very high (91.59) to a medium level (74.45). Conclusion: Data show the ACT-RSK had a positive effect and improved  variables."
Predicting parenting stress in caregivers of  with brain tumours,2013,"Objective: The purpose of the  was to identify factors that contribute to  stress in caregivers of  diagnosed with brain tumours. Methods: The  was cross-sectional and recruited 37 participants from a clinical database at a specialist 's hospital. s were sent questionnaires, which were used to measure factors related to stress in caregivers of  diagnosed with a brain tumour. Stress levels were measured using the  Stress Index-Short Form (PSI/SF). Correlation analysis and multiple linear regression were used to examine the associations between  stress and coping , locus of control, -perceived  disability and time since diagnosis. Results: Results revealed that 51% of s were experiencing clinically significant levels of stress. The mean stress level of s in the  was significantly higher than the PSI/SF norms (t = 4.7, p < .001). Regression analysis revealed that external locus of control and coping by accepting responsibility accounted for 67% of the variance in  stress. Other  of coping,  behaviour problems and the amount of time since diagnosis were not found to be predictive of levels of  stress. Conclusions: There was a high prevalence of  stress in caregivers of  with a brain tumour. An external locus of control and coping by accepting responsibility increased the likelihood of elevated levels of stress. Results emphasised the importance of ongoing support for s of  with brain tumours. Intervention might helpfully be centred on strategies to increase s' internal locus of control.

Evaluation of a Brief Format of the Triple P-Positive Parenting Program: A Pilot Study With Indonesian Parents Residing in Australia,2014,"Dissemination of evidence-based  programs in developing countries is warranted, but prior to dissemination, the cultural appropriateness of programs needs to be assessed. This  provides an evaluation of the level of acceptability among Indonesian s and the efficacy of a brief  program, the Triple P-Positive  seminar. Thirty Indonesian s of  aged 2-12 years old residing in Australia participated in the . A 90-minute Triple P seminar with minimal changes in the format was delivered to s in Indonesian. s reported a high level of acceptability and satisfaction with the program content. The efficacy of the program was  explored. s reported less frequent use of dysfunctional  practices, particularly permissive  , and reduction in the intensity of  emotional and behavioural problems 3 weeks after the seminar. The effect was maintained at 3-month follow up. The  suggest that the Triple P seminar is acceptable and useful for Indonesian s. Substantial changes in the content of the  program may not be necessary. Translated materials, culturally relevant examples and opportunity for questions appeared sufficient for s. Future studies are required, including randomised controlled trials and larger sample sizes."
Parenting Styles and Parents' Perspectives on How Their Own Emotions Affect the Functioning of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders,2014,"The grounded theory method was used to analyze the   used by caregivers to rear  with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and to investigate s' experiences regarding how to help their  overcome the symptoms. Thirty-two s from 28 families of  with ASD in mainland China were interviewed. Analysis of interview transcripts revealed four patterns of   which varied in affiliation to the roles of caretaker and coach. Based on their experience, a sizable group of s perceived that their own emotions influence the 's emotions and his/her symptoms.

"Exposure to  care, parenting style and attachment security",2004,"The   addressed whether security of attachment is differentiated by quality of  and quantity of exposure to  care. Sixty mothers participated with their 14-month-old infants, who by the age of 12-months had received either exclusive maternal care, or varying degrees of exposure to  care. Levels of attachment security were assessed through maternal completion of the Attachment Q-Set(AQS);  quality was assessed through observations of mother-infant interactions during structured tasks. The scores that less sensitive mothers assign their toddlers is higher when their  are in  care for more hours per week; whereas the scores that more sensitive mothers assign their toddlers is lower when their  are in  care for more hours per week. These contrasting patterns suggest that the effects of   on attachment security are moderated by quantity of exposure to  care. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd."
"Out of India: Towards a conceptual framework on internationalization motives, parenting styles and human resource management practices among Indian MNE subsidiaries in Ireland",2020,"The significant growth of Asian multinational enterprises (MNEs) in western economies in recent years, in particular in smaller advanced economies such as Ireland, has led to calls for a deeper understanding of the drivers of location choice among these MNEs and for more compelling accounts of the  and management of the subsidiaries being established. In this conceptual contribution, we focus on the specific case of Indian MNEs with subsidiaries in Ireland. Assembling theoretical insights from the literature on   and headquarter-subsidiary interactions, coupled with practice-led observations garnered from Indian MNEs, we develop a conceptual framework elucidating key variations in headquarter-subsidiary relationships and the HR policy and practice mix. We reason that the preferred approach to corporate , vested in adding value to the subsidiary, extracting value from it, or seeking a balance in the overall exchange,  in a range of interactions between headquarters and subsidiaries, encompassing integration, collaboration or local responsiveness. Furthermore, we postulate that the preferred headquarter-subsidiary interactions influence the subsequent HR recipes adopted in the subsidiary setting as it seeks to build its strategic position within the broader MNE network. In order to deepen lines of inquiry around these different interactions, we advance a series of propositions for testing."

Parent- and -reported parenting. Associations with  weight-related outcomes,2011,"The   aimed to investigate associations of both -reported and -perceived   and -reported  practices with  weight and weight-related behaviours. Participants were 175  (56% female) aged between 7 and 11, and their primary caregivers (91% female), recruited through South Australian primary schools. Children completed measures of  , attitude toward fruit, vegetables, and non-core food, and attraction to physical activity. s completed measures of   and domain-specific  practices (feeding and activity-related practices) and reported on  dietary intake, physical activity, and sedentary behaviour. Objective height and weight measurements were taken from , from which body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Child-reported   and -reported  practices were uniquely associated with  weight-related outcomes, but  and practices did not interact in their association with  outcomes. Child-reported   was associated with  food and activity attitudes, whereas -reported   was not associated with  outcomes. The findings of the   generally support the recommendation of a   high in demandingness and responsiveness for supporting healthy  weight-related behaviours, along with appropriate domain-specific practices.

"Parenting styles, coping strategies, and the expression of homesickness",2007,"The   examined the role of   in the experience and expression of homesickness, and the way of coping with the feelings involved. Using a sample of 670 first year college and university students, aged 16 to 25, we tested three hypotheses: (1) authoritarian, permissive as well as uninvolved  are associated with the experience of homesickness, contrary to students with authoritative s who are less likely to have feelings of homesickness; (2) students with authoritarian, permissive or uninvolved s show their homesickness by internalizing and externalizing problems; and (3) students raised by authoritative or permissive s use more effective coping strategies to deal with homesickness. Results indicated that students raised by authoritative and permissive s experienced more homesickness with stronger feelings of homesickness than students raised by authoritarian or uninvolved s. However, they hardly express homesickness by internalizing or externalizing problems when they use effective ways of coping, namely support-seeking and/or problem-solving. Students with s endorsing an authoritarian or uninvolved  , on the other hand, showed more internalizing and externalizing problems in reaction to feelings of homesickness. They  use less effective coping strategies. The  revealed the importance of a loving and accepting home environment for the development and expression of homesickness, as well as the importance of the way in which students learn to cope with their problems.

The Relation Between Emotional Availability and Parenting Style: Cultural and Economic Factors in a Diverse Sample of Young Mothers,2009,"Objective. The goals of this  were to examine emotional availability,  attitudes, and  behaviors in relation to   and cultural context in a diverse group of young mothers. Design. Participants were 313 first-time adolescent mothers of toddler-aged  from European American, Latin American, and African American backgrounds. Emotional availability was assessed using the Emotional Availability Scales, and cluster analysis was used to examine relations with mothers' reports of  attitudes and behaviors. Results. Three   emerged from the data: democratic, strict loving, and directive. The democratic and directive   were related to maternal ethnicity; European American mothers were more highly reed in the democratic  group, and Latin American mothers were more highly reed in the directive  group. In multivariate regression analysis, maternal Sensitivity was predicted by socioeconomic indicators but not ethnicity. Cultural background predicted  of ; socioeconomic markers predicted Sensitivity. Conclusions. Results are situated within current  about adolescent , cultural context, and the strong confound between ethnicity and income within the United States."
Parenting Style and Family Meals: Cross-Sectional and 5-Year Longitudinal Associations,2010,"Background Research on family meals in the past decade has shown a positive association between family meal frequency and adolescent healthy dietary intake. However, less is known about factors within the home environment, such as  , that may be associated with family meal patterns. Objective The purpose of this  is to test cross-sectional and 5-year longitudinal associations between   (authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and neglectful) and the frequency of family meals among adolescents. Study design Data were from Project Eating Among Teens, a population-based  comprised of youth from diverse ethnic/racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. Two cohorts of adolescents (middle school and high school) completed in-class surveys in 1999 (Time 1) and mailed surveys in 2004 (Time 2). Multiple linear regression models were used to predict mean frequency of family meals at Time 1 and Time 2 from adolescent report of   (both mother and father) at Time 1. Cross-sectional analyses included both adolescent cohorts (n=4,746) and longitudinal analyses included only the younger cohort (n=806) because family meal frequency was not assessed in the older cohort at Time 2. Results Cross-sectional  for adolescent girls indicated a positive association between maternal and paternal authoritative   and frequency of family meals. For adolescent boys, maternal authoritative   was associated with more frequent family meals. Longitudinal  indicated that authoritative   predicted higher frequency of family meals 5 years later, but only between opposite sex /adolescent dyads. Conclusions Future  should identify additional factors within the home environment that are associated with family meal frequency to develop effective interventions that  in increased family meals for youth. Also, future  should investigate the mealtime behaviors of authoritative s and identify specific behaviors that dietetics practitioners and other health care providers could share with s of adolescents to help them increase family meal frequency.

"Learning and Parenting in Spanish Environments: Prosocial Behavior, Aggression, and Self-Concept",2019,"The psychology of sustainability and sustainable development is related to improvements in people's quality of life in different environments, including the family. Based on this theoretical approach, this  explores the relationships between   (maternal and paternal support, control, and neglect) and prosocial behavior, aggression, and self-concept of  from Spain aged 4-7 years (M = 5.81; DS = 1.05). Participants were 635 boys and girls (53.7% boys; 46.3% girls) from Valencia and Castellon (Spain). Most s had low educational levels and low-qualified, temporary jobs. Over 82% of participants were from Spain. The other participants were from Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa, and Southeast Asia. The  indicate that maternal support and control have the strongest relationships with 's prosocial behavior, aggression, and self-concept, fundamentally as predictors of self-concept and aggression. According to 's perceptions, maternal  plays a more prominent role than paternal . Authoritarian and neglectful  at these ages seems to be perceived less negatively than at other ages, and the effects of such  may arise at a later age. Furthermore, prosocial behavior and self-concept curb aggression. These  can support the design of interventions in hood."
"Antecedents of maternal parenting stress: the role of attachment style, prenatal attachment, and dyadic adjustment in first-time mothers",2015,"The transition to hood is widely considered a period of increased vulnerability often accompanied by stress. Abidin conceived  stress as referring to specific difficulties in adjusting to the  role. Most studies of psychological distress arising from the demands of  have investigated the impact of stress on the development of dysfunctional   relationships and on adult and  psychopathology. Studies have largely focused on mothers' postnatal experience; less attention has been devoted to maternal prenatal characteristics associated with subsequent al stress and studies of maternal prenatal predictors are few. Furthermore, no studies have examined that association exclusively with samples of first-time mothers. With an observational prospective  design with two time periods, the aim of this  was to investigate the role of mothers' attachment , maternal prenatal attachment to the fetus and dyadic adjustment during pregnancy (7th months of gestation) and their potential unique contribution to  stress 3 months after birth in a sample of nulliparous women. Results showed significant correlations between antenatal measures. Maternal attachment  (especially relationship anxiety) was negatively correlated with prenatal attachment and with dyadic adjustment; positive correlations ed between prenatal attachment and dyadic adjustment. Each of the investigated variables was  good predictor of  stress 3 months after birth. Findings suggested how these dimensions could be considered as risk factors in the transition to motherhood and in the very beginning of the emergence of the caregiving system, especially with first-time mothers."
Reaction to diagnosis and parenting styles among mothers of young  with ASDs,2008,"When a  is diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) s often experience a range of difficult feelings, which typically are not addressed in -focused interventions. This  examined the relationship between a mother's acceptance of and sense of resolution regarding her 's diagnosis of an ASD and maternal interaction , controlling for  competence, autism symptoms and maternal depression. Participants included 63  with an ASD between 20 and 50 months of age and their mothers. Mothers who were more emotionally resolved were rated as higher in Cognitive Engagement and Supportive Engagement in play interactions, reflecting greater verbal and nonverbal scaffolding to enhance the 's play and attention to activities and greater reciprocity and mutual enjoyment. This  highlights the importance of considering a mother's resolution about her 's diagnosis, suggesting that maternal emotions and cognitions associated with the diagnosis may be potential targets for intervention."
Perceived Parenting Styles of Individuals With Gender Dysphoria,2021,"Objective: To map patterns of behavior of s and/or caregivers as perceived by their adult , transgender patients seen through the Programa Transdisciplinar de Identidade de Genero, and to determine if one   was more prevalent.Design: 82 patients were interviewed by the  Style Inventory.Results: The 82 patients (32 transgender men and 50 transgender women) completed a total of 145 protocols, being 65 concerning their fathers, and 80 concerning their mothers. The transgender women's perceptions of their mothers were significantly different from those concerning their fathers. The transgender men and women had a positive mean perception of their relationship with their mothers and a negative mean perception of their fathers. The transgender women had on average a positive perception of their relationship with their mothers and a negative perception of their relationship with their fathers. This difference in perception was primarily in positive practices; the women felt that their mothers exhibited more positive practices of Positive Monitoring (A) and Moral Behavior (B) than their fathers. When we compared negative practices, negligence alone was considered the worst al pattern by both transgender men and women.Conclusion: Our  shows that fathers, more so than mothers, need to be encouraged to participate in the process of understanding the transgender condition and that in general, families need to be supported by mental health professionals to provide a more welcoming environment for individuals with Gender Dysphoria."
Bidirectional Associations Between Self-Regulation and Parenting Styles in Early Adolescence,2015,"The goal of this  was to explore bidirectional associations between teens' self-regulation and maternal and paternal   (i.e., authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive-indulgent) over one year. As part of an ongoing longitudinal , 489 teens ages 11-16 (51% female, 70% European American, 69% in two- households) and their s completed questionnaires on two occasions. Analyses revealed high temporal stability of  and self-regulation over time. No cross-lagged effects emerged in either authoritative  model. Bidirectional effects were observed in the maternal authoritarian  model only. Child effects on  were revealed in both permissive-indulgent  models. The interpretation of these findings and their implications for future  are delineated in the discussion."
Parental fatigue and parenting practices during early hood: an Australian community survey,2012,"Background  behaviours are influenced by a range of factors, including al functioning. Although common, the influence of al fatigue on  practices is not known. The first aim of this  was to investigate the relationship between fatigue and  practices. The second aim was to identify al psychosocial factors significantly associated with fatigue. Methods A sample of 1276 Australian s, of at least one  aged 05 years, completed a survey. Demographic, psychosocial (social support, coping responses) and al sleep and self-care information was collected. Hierarchical regression was performed to assess the contribution of fatigue (modified Fatigue Assessment Scale) to al practices (warmth, irritability and involvement), and  experiences ( Stress Index,  Sense of Competence Scale). Hierarchical multiple regression assessed the contribution of a range of al sleep, psychosocial (social support, coping responses) and self-care variables to fatigue when demographic characteristics were held constant. Results Higher fatigue was significantly associated with lower al competence (beta=-0.17, P < 0.005), greater  stress (beta= 0.21, P < 0.005) and more irritability in  interactions (beta= 0.11, P < 0.005). Several psychosocial characteristics were associated with higher al fatigue, including inadequate social support, poorer diet, poorer sleep quality and ineffective coping  including self-blame and behaviour disengagement. Conclusions Fatigue is common, and  suggest that fatigue contributes to adverse al practices and experiences. However, possible risk factors for higher fatigue were identified in this , indicating opportunities for intervention, management and support for s."
African American adolescent girls in impoverished communities: Parenting style and adolescent outcomes,2001,"The relationship between   and adolescent functioning was examined in a sample of 302 African American adolescent girls and their mothers who lived in impoverished neighborhoods. Although previous  has found that authoritative , as compared with authoritarian, permissive, and disengaged , is associated with positive adolescent outcomes in both European American, middle-class and large multiethnic school-based samples, these  categories have not been fully explored in African American families living at or near poverty level. Data were collected from adolescent girls and their self-identified mothers or mother figures using in-home interviews and self-administered questionnaires.   was found to be significantly related to adolescent outcome in multiple domains including externalizing and internalizing behaviors, academic achievement, work orientation, sexual experience, and pregnancy history. Specifically, teens whose mothers were disengaged (low on both al warmth and supervision/monitoring) were found to have the most negative outcomes."
"Indulgent Parenting, Helicopter Parenting, and Well-being of Parents and Emerging Adults",2019,"ObjectivesResearch on indulgent  in hood and adolescence and its association with helicopter  in emerging adulthood and the well-being of s and emerging adult  is limited. In this , we examined (1) the association between indulgent  in hood and adolescence and helicopter  in emerging adulthood, (2) the association between indulgent  and s'  stress and negative well-being, and (3) whether helicopter  mediated the association between indulgent  and emerging adults' psychological problems.MethodsThe sample was composed of 449 college students with a subsample of 142 -student dyads.ResultsResults from analyses on s (Part I, N=142) and emerging adults (Part II, N=449) suggested that (1) indulgent  in hood and adolescence was associated with helicopter  in emerging adulthood (b=.69, p<.01 in Part I; b=.58, p<.01 in Part II), (2) there was a positive association between indulgent  and s' negative well-being (b=.26, p<.01 in Part I) and  stress (b=.29, p<.01 in Part I), and (3) helicopter  mediated the association between indulgent  and emerging adults' depressive and anxiety symptoms and emotional dysregulation (.15, 95% CI .03 to .43 in Part II).ConclusionsImplications for  and emerging adult health programs were discussed."
Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between parenting style and adolescent girls' physical activity,2012,"Background: Understanding the influences on physical activity is crucial, particularly among important target groups such as adolescent girls. This  describes cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between   and girls' participation in organized sport, walking/cycling trips and objectively assessed moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Methods: Data were collected from adolescent girls (n=222) and their s in 2004 and again in 2006. s self-reported their demographic characteristics and  . Girls self-reported their organized sport participation and weekly walking/cycling trips, while MVPA was assessed using accelerometers. Linear regression and interaction analyses were performed. Interactions between socio-demographic factors and   with organized sport, walking/cycling trips and MVPA are ed. Results: There were cross-sectional associations between authoritative (B=-0.45, p=0.042) and indulgent (B=-0.56, p=0.002)  and the number of walking/cycling trips, and authoritarian (B=0.27, p=0.033)  and frequency of organized sport. Significant interactions included those between: family status, authoritative  and daily (p=0.048) and week day (p=0.013) MVPA; education, indulgent  and MVPA on weekend days (p=0.006); and, employment, authoritarian  and duration and frequency of organized sport (p=0.004), highlighting the complexity of these relationships. Longitudinal analyses revealed significant decreases in organized sport and MVPA, significant increases in walking/cycling trips and no significant associations between  and physical activity. Conclusion:   appear to influence walking and cycling trips among adolescent girls, though not physical activity within other domains. Socio-demographic characteristics interact with the relationships between  and physical activity. While these findings can inform the development of family-based interventions to improve  and adolescent health, the direction of the observed associations and the number of associations approaching significance suggest the need to further explore this area."
Parenting styles and adolescents' self-esteem in Brazil,2007,"This  explored the relationship between   and self-esteem among 1,239 11- to 15-yr.-old Brazilian adolescents (54% girls; M aged 13.4 yr., SD = 1.4). Teenagers' families were classified into I of 4 groups (Authoritative, Authoritarian, Indulgent, or Neglectful) based on adolescents' answers to the ESPA29 al Socialization Scale. Participants completed the AF5 Multidimensional Self-Esteem Scale which appraises five dimensions: Academic, Social, Emotional, Family, and Physical. Analyses showed that Brazilian adolescents from Indulgent families scored equal (Academic and Social) or higher (Family) in Self-esteem than adolescents from Authoritative families. Adolescents from Indulgent families scored higher than adolescents from Authoritarian and Neglectful families in four Self-esteem dimensions, Academic, Social, Family, and Physical. Adolescents from Authoritative families scored higher than adolescents from Authoritarian and Neglectful families in three Self-esteem dimensions, Academic, Social, and Family. These  suggest that Authoritative  is not associated with optimum self-esteem in Brazil."
Role of Parenting Style in Achieving Metabolic Control in Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes,2011,"OBJECTIVE-To examine the role of   in achieving metabolic control and treatment adherence in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-s of 100 adolescents with type 1 diabetes completed assessments of their   and sense of helplessness. s and patients rated patient adherence to the treatment regimen. Glycemic control was evaluated by HbA(1c) values. RESULTS-An authoritative paternal   predicted better glycemic control and adherence in the ; a permissive maternal   predicted poor adherence. A higher sense of helplessness in both s predicted worse glycemic control and lesser adherence to treatment. al sense of helplessness was a significant predictor of diabetes control after correcting for other confounders (patient age, sex, and treatment method). CONCLUSIONS-An authoritative nonhelpless   is associated with better diabetes control in adolescents. Paternal involvement is important in adolescent diabetes management. These  have implications for psychological interventions."
Parenting Styles of Mothers With Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing Children and Hearing Siblings,2012,"The   aims to determine whether rearing a deaf or hard-of-hearing (d/hh)  would differentiate the  and disciplinary preference of s between the d/hh and the hearing .

In a linear regression  Stress was most closely related to Relationship-related Anxiety (b = 0.20, t = 39.0), weaker associations were found with the attachment dimensions capturing avoidance: Importance of Independence (b = 0.07, t = 13.40) and Discomfort with Closeness (b = 0.07, t = 12.04). The SPSQ subscales Incompetence (R-2 = 17%) and Social Isolation (R-2 = 22%) showed stronger association with adult attachment than the remaining three. Conclusion: The agreement with previous findings in other  populations indicates that substantial and meaningful dimensions of attachment have been captured. Attachment anxiety and discomfort with closeness seem to have an important relationship with the perception of  stress, especially concerning feelings of incompetence and social isolation."
"Interactive Relations Among Maternal Depressive Symptomatology, Nutrition, and Parenting",2012,"Theoretical models linking maternal nutrition, depressive symptomatology, and  are underdeveloped. However, existing literature suggests that iron status and depressive symptomatology interact in relation to problematic   (authoritarian, permissive). Therefore, in the current  the authors investigate these interactive relations in a sample of breastfeeding mothers (n = 105) interviewed at three months postpartum. Participants completed questionnaires (from December 2008 to January 2011) regarding their depressive symptomatology and  . Iron status (i.e., hemoglobin, soluble transferrin receptors, and serum ferritin concentrations) was assessed from blood samples. Significant interactions were found between iron status and depressive symptomatology in relation to authoritarian   (low warmth, high punishment and directiveness). For those women with hemoglobin below 14.00 g/dL, depressive symptomatology was positively related to authoritarian   (p < 0.001). Thus, screening for poor iron status and depressive sympatomology in postpartum women may help to identify those at risk for problematic . Dietary interventions may help to eliminate relations between depressive symptoms and problematic ."
Is parenting style related to 's healthy eating and physical activity in Latino families?,2006,"  influence a 's risk for obesity. The goals of this  are to evaluate the influence of (i)   on 's health behaviors (physical activity and dietary intake), (ii) 's sociodemographic characteristics on   and on 's health behaviors and (iii) s' sociodemographic characteristics on their use of controlling  to promote a healthy home environment. Survey and anthropometric data were collected from a community sample of Latino s (n = 812) and their  in kindergarten through second grade. al use of positive reinforcement and monitoring was associated with 's healthy eating and exercise. Also, s' use of appropriate disciplining  was associated with healthier eating, while al use of control  was associated with unhealthy eating. The daughters of s who used controlling  ate more unhealthy foods than did the sons. Older, employed and more acculturated s used less controlling  than their counterparts.  interventions targeting 's dietary intake and physical activity should encourage s to use more positive reinforcement and monitor their 's health behaviors as these   are associated with healthier behaviors. Moreover, intervention ers may want to encourage Latino s to use less controlling  with girls as this   increased girls' risk for unhealthy eating."
"Parenting styles, adolescents' attributions, and educational outcomes in nine heterogeneous high schools",1997,"This article examined the contemporaneous and predictive relations between  , adolescents' attributions, and 4 educational outcomes. Data were collected from adolescents attending 6 high schools in California and 3 high schools in Wisconsin during the 1987-1988 and 1988-1989 school years. The  of path analyses partially confirmed the central hypotheses. Adolescents who perceived their s as being nonauthoritative were more likely than their peers to attribute achievement outcomes to external causes or to low ability. Furthermore, the higher the proportion of dysfunctional attributions made for academic successes and failures, the lower the levels of classroom engagement and homework 1 year later. Although adolescents' attributional  provided a bridge between   and 2 educational outcomes, it did not fully explain the impact of  on those outcomes. Additional analyses within gender and ethnic subgroups reinforced the overall pattern of findings observed within the entire sample."
Parenting in youth tennis: Understanding and enhancing 's experiences,2014,"Objective: The overall purpose of this  was to develop a grounded theory of optimal al involvement in youth tennis. Design: A Straussian grounded theory methodology (Corbin 82 Strauss, 2008; Strauss 82 Corbin, 1998) was used. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with 90 youth tennis players, ex-youth players, s, and coaches from the United Kingdom. Data were analyzed through a process of open and axial coding, and theoretical integration. Through this process data were broken down into smaller units (concepts), relationships between concepts were identified, and a substantive grounded theory was developed. Results: The grounded theory of optimal al involvement in tennis was built around the core category of 'understanding and enhancing your 's tennis journey.' The core category was underpinned by three categories: (a) Share and communicate goals, which referred to the need for s and  to have the same aims for the 's tennis involvement; (b) develop an understanding emotional climate, which accounted for the need for s to continually seek to foster an environment in which  perceived s understand their experience, and; (c) engage in enhancing  practices at competitions, which denoted the specific behaviors s should display in relation to competitive tennis. Conclusion: The theory predicts that consistency between goals, emotional climate, and  practices will optimize  in youth tennis. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Teaching a novel word: Parenting styles and toddlers' word learning,2019,"We examined the  that s adopted while teaching a novel word to their toddlers and whether those  related to 's word learning and engagement during the task. Participants were 36 s and their toddlers (M-age = 20 months). s were videotaped while teaching their  a name for a novel object. al utterances were transcribed verbatim and coded for cognitive and autonomy support. Children's utterances were coded for elicited and spontaneous contributions. Children's ability to recognize and process the novel word was assessed using the Looking-While-Listening task. Two al cognitive support  were identified via cluster analysis: Cognitive Scaffolders, who combined a diversity of teaching moves, and Labelers, who focused on labeling the novel object for the . Similarly, two al autonomy support  were identified: Followers, who focused on following the 's lead and providing positive feedback, and Non-followers, who used diverse communicative ways to engage the . Compared with s who were Labelers, s who were Cognitive Scaffolders were not more or less likely to be Followers. Children of Cognitive Scaffolders were better at recognizing the novel word, and  of Followers were more engaged (provided more elicited and spontaneous contributions) in the word-teaching task. Children's ability to recognize the novel word was not related to their engagement. Findings highlight the unique contributions of al cognitive and autonomy support to 's word learning and engagement. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Parenting style and the development of moral reasoning,1999,"This paper addresses the polarisation among theoretical perspectives in moral psychology regarding the relative significance of s and peers in 's moral development and, in particular, the short shrift given the family context by cognitive-developmental theory. We contend that s do play a significant role in this area of their 's development. Research findings from two studies are ed which indicate that s' interaction , ego functioning and level of moral reasoning used in discussion are predictive of 's subsequent moral reasoning development. The findings  illustrate the role of affective factors, in contrast to the contemporary emphasis on moral rationality, and the relevance of real-life dilemmas, in contrast to the paradigmatic reliance on hypothetical dilemmas. Implications of these findings for our understanding of the role of   in 's moral development and for further  are discussed."
The 1-2-3 Magic parenting program and its effect on  problem behaviors and dysfunctional parenting: A randomized controlled trial,2014,"This  investigated the effectiveness of the 1-2-3 Magic  program, a brief cognitive-behavioral program, when delivered to large groups of caregivers. The effectiveness of two versions of the programs in reducing  problem behaviors and dysfunctional , and the effect on emotion-related  , were examined. Ninety-two participants with 2-12-year-old  were randomly assigned to one of three groups: DVD (n = 31); Emotion-coaching (EC) (n = 31); or Waitlist-control (n = 30). Both intervention groups reported significantly decreased  problem behaviors, dysfunctional , al depression and al stress at post-intervention as compared to the control group. Additionally, the DVD group reported decreased al anxiety, and the EC group reported a decrease in emotion-dismissing  . Emotion-coaching   remained unchanged for all groups at post-intervention. The  were maintained after three months. After two years, all intervention effects were maintained for the DVD group. For the EC group, effects were maintained on the main outcome variables. The  suggest that both 1-2-3 Magic programs are effective at reducing  problem behavior and dysfunctional  when delivered to large groups of caregivers, and that both programs are suitable for a broad delivery approach.

The Models of Early Childhood Parenting In Families Whose Mothers are Factory Workers in Indonesia,2021,"This  aimed to describe and formulate the models of early hood  in families whose mothers were factory workers. In this case  an explorative descriptive qualitative  method was used. The participants of the , who were selected using random sampling and snowball methods, were composed of 1230 families having 0- 4 years old , and 123 chidren whose mothers were workers in wig and fake eyelashes factory in Padamara, Purbalingga District. The data were collected via interview, observation, and documentation techniques, and were analyzed through content analysis and comparative analysis techniques. The resuls showed that there were two types of early hood  models, first, familybased  model, and second,  model by alternative caregivers. The family-based  model consisted of two subtypes of  models, namely (1)  by the nuclear family; in this model, the  was raised by the father; (2)  by extended family; in this model, there were two models of  being the model of  by the grandmother, and that by the relatives (aunt). As for the model of  by alternative caregivers,  were taken care of by babysitters who were living around the 's residence. Each  model reed different  . The model of  by the grandmother reed permissive  ; the model of  by babysitters res semi permissive-semi authoritative  ; the model of  by the relatives (aunt) reed semi authoritative  ; the model of  by fathers reed authoritative with tendencies semi-authoritarian  ."
Effectiveness of an indigenous parent training program on change in parenting styles and delinquent tendencies (challenging behaviors) in Pakistan: A randomized controlled trial,2019,"The effectiveness of an indigenous  training program was examined within selected Pakistani families. For this purpose, 110 s of adolescents with above-average levels of delinquent tendencies (challenging behaviors), who were screened and chosen from five randomly selected schools in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan, participated in the . The adolescents' s were randomly placed into either an intervention group or a control group. Members of the intervention group participated in seven sessions of  training, which aimed to increase behaviors associated with an authoritative  . Findings show that participants in the  training program displayed an increase in authoritative  behaviors and a decrease in authoritarian and neglectful  behaviors at both posttest and follow-up. In addition, their  showed reductions in -reported challenging behaviors. Declines in challenging behaviors were explained by increases in authoritative  behaviors, although not all intervention effects could be explained by such increases. We conclude that, similar to Western countries, the authoritative   is the most effective   for managing adolescents' challenging behaviors in Pakistan. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Differential impacts of the Brazilian Strengthening Families Program (SFP 10-14): A study into changes in the parenting styles of vulnerable families,2021,"Adolescents living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are not only exposed to underprivileged conditions - they are  at greater risk of being raised with negative  practices that may have detrimental effects on their psychosocial development and health. Thus, the implementation and evaluation of family-based interventions that foster positive  practices among vulnerable populations are necessary. The aim of this  is to examine if the Brazilian Strengthening Families Program (SFP) has a differential impact on   in the short, medium, and long terms. This was achieved through a single-group longitudinal design with four data collection moments.   were assessed using the al Practices Scale at baseline and then after delivering the program, with follow-ups after 6/8 and 10/12 months. The sample comprised 361 adolescents aged 10-14 years from low-income families in northeastern Brazil. A combination of hierarchical and non-hierarchical cluster-analysis methods offered a four-cluster solution reing the four  : authoritative, authoritarian, indulgent, and negligent. Mixed ANOVAs revealed a main effect of time on both responsiveness and demandingness, indicating that overall levels were higher post-test than pretest. There were improvements in the responsiveness levels among authoritarian s, as well as improvements in the demandingness levels among indulgent s. The Brazilian SFP (10-14) appears promising for improving  , which it does by strengthening the weakest al aspect to enhance positive  in families living in underprivileged conditions."
Perceived parenting style and practices and the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages by adolescents,2007,"The purpose of this  was to investigate whether perceived  practices and   dimensions (strictness and involvement) are associated with adolescents' consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. In this cross-sectional , secondary school students (n = 383, mean age 13.5 years) completed a self-administered questionnaire on their consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, attitude, social influences, self-efficacy, habit strength, food-related  practices and the general   dimensions of 'strictness' and 'involvement'. Data were analyzed using multiple linear regression analyses. More restrictive  practices were associated with lower consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (beta = -38.0 ml; 95% CI = -48.1, -28.0). This association was highly mediated (similar to 55%) by attitude, self-efficacy and modeling from s. Nevertheless, a significant direct effect remained (beta = -17.1 ml; 95% CI = -27.2, -6.90). Interactions between perceived   and  practices showed that the association between  practices and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption was stronger among adolescents who perceived their s as being moderately strict and highly involved. s influence their 's sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and should therefore be involved in interventions aimed at changing dietary behaviors. Interventions aimed at the promotion of healthy  practices will improve when they are tailored to the general   of the participants."
Perceived Mother-Father Dyad Parenting Typologies Across Four Regions in the United States,,"Although much  has investigated  , few studies have examined  across regions of the United States. The current  used a nationwide sample to examine perceived maternal and paternal  in four regions of the United States: Northeast, South, Midwest, and West. Participants included 1080 emerging adults who answered questionnaires regarding their perceptions of maternal and paternal   using an online survey. In all regions, the largest profile indicated a   of High Authoritative/Authoritarian and Moderate Permissive mothers and fathers. Similarly, all regions indicated profiles that were High or Very High Authoritarian mothers and fathers. All regions except the West had a profile with High Authoritative mothers and High or Very High Authoritarian fathers. The Northeast, South, and West  had unique profiles found only in those regions. Thus,  indicate similarities as well as distinct differences in   across regions of the United States."
Parenting style and cultural influences on overweight 's attraction to physical activity,2007,"Objective: To investigate the associations among  , gender, Chinese culture, and overweight 's attraction to physical activity. Research Methods and Procedures: A total of 104 s with overweight  were recruited from six primary schools in Hong Kong, China. Only overweight  in grades 3 through 6 (8 to 12 years of age) were invited to participate. Overweight  were defined and identified using the international cut-off points stratified by sex and age. Questionnaires were used to assess Children's Attraction to Physical Activity (CAPA), perceived competence, and al socialization influences. Results: al influence, especially father's role modeling, was significantly related to attraction to physical activity in overweight Chinese . Perceived physical competence was  an important correlate of an overweight 's attraction to physical activity. Gender differences in CAPA were not significant among the Chinese overweight . However, gender differences were observed in the relationship between  physical activity orientation and CAPA. Discussion: In addition to a 's perceived competence, father's role modeling can provide additional and significant influence with regard to overweight 's attraction to physical activity. Differences in cultural orientation toward body weight should be considered when explaining overweight 's physical activity."
Gender and Birth Order as Parenting Moderators,2010,"This  aimed at assessing gender and birth order influence on  and perceived al favoritism from the  perspective.

Avoidant attachment and the experience of parenting,2006,"Guided by attachment theory, this  investigated connections between avoidant attachment  and the experience of  after the birth of a couple's first . One hundred and six couples completed a battery of measures approximately 6 weeks before and 6 months after the birth of their first . As anticipated, s with more avoidant attachment  experienced greater stress after the birth of their  and perceived  as less satisfying and personally meaningful. Attachment theory maintains that adult attachment  should affect relationships with adults and with ones . The  findings provide some of the first evidence that self-reported adult romantic attachment , which have been the focus of attachment  by social and personality psychologists, are systematically associated with - relationships. They  provide insight into the processes through which secure and insecure attachment  might be transmitted from one generation to the next."
The Relationship Between Parenting Styles and Academic and Behavioral Adjustment Among Urban Chinese Adolescents,2014,"This article examines the relationship between   and adolescents' academic and behavioral outcomes. Based on data collected from eighth-graders in two cities in China, we find that the majority of Chinese s adopt optimal  , such as democratic or authoritative  . Democratic  is the optimal   among urban Chinese boys because sons of democratic mothers have better academic achievement and engage in fewer delinquent activities than sons raised by other types of mothers, including authoritative mothers. Sons of democratic fathers have better academic achievements than sons of other types of fathers, including authoritative fathers. Conversely, maternal warmth is essential to cultivating academic and behavioral competence among urban Chinese girls, and paternal warmth is crucial to reducing delinquency among girls. Girls of authoritarian or neglectful s have lower grades and engage in more delinquent activities than girls of authoritative or democratic s."
"Adolescent self-handicapping, depressive affect, and maternal parenting styles",2000,"Most  on self-handicapping has focused on adults. Only a few studies have examined self-handicapping in adolescents or the particular characteristics of the family environment that are associated with self-handicapping. Adolescents (N = 141) and their mothers completed a series of questionnaires assessing adolescent self-handicapping adolescent dysphoria, and  variables in mothers, including   (care and overprotection) and  stress due To situational variables, - dysfunctional interactions, and behavioral characteristics of the . Results showed (a) that self-handicapping was positively related to age in girls, but not in boys, (b) that there was a strong relation between self-handicapping and dysphoria in both boys and girls, (c) that mother-rated cave negatively predicted self-handicapping in girls beyond the effects due to girls' dysphoria, and (d) that maternal care moderated the relationship between self-handicapping and dysphoria in boys. Maternal cave and depressive affect in young persons are independently related to self-handicapping behaviors in adolescents. Results are discussed in terms of implications for the hypothesized etiology of self-handicapping."
"Relationship between parenting, alexithymia and adult attachment styles: a cross-national study in Sicilian and Andalusian young adults",2017,"Literature underline that attachment  can be considered as an important factor that facilitates exploration of the self and environment, and influences individual's thoughts, feelings and behavior, above all during adolescence. The purposes of the   were the following: to investigate the relationship between , alexithymia and adult attachment ; to measure the predictive variables of the adult attachment-related anxiety and avoidance and the predictors of the level of alexithymia. The participants were 217 students, of which: a group of 97 Andalusian academic students (44.7%), aged between 18 and 29 (M = 19.47; SD = 2.23); a group of 120 students from Sicilian academic students (55.3%), aged between 18 and 23 (M = 18.85; SD = 1.11). The participants were assigned to complete the following questionnaires: the al Bonding Instrument, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale, and the Experience in Close Relationships. Findings suggest that there are differences between Italy and Spain in adult attachment : in particular, Italian students appeared to manifest a higher tendency to use the avoidance  than Spanish ones, which manifested a higher level of anxiety. Furthermore, belonging to the Andalusian culture, and above all, having an elevated perception of the paternal and maternal overprotection could re possible predictive variables to the general level of alexithymia. The  of this  support the  hypothesis that alexithymia is associated with the perceived al bonding and attachment ."
Influence of parenting style on the offspring's behaviour and CSF monoamine metabolite levels in crossfostered and noncrossfostered female rhesus macaques,2006,"We investigated the association between variation in   and the offspring's behaviour and CSF monoantine metabolite (5-HIAA, HVA, and MHPG) levels in rhesus monkeys. Study subjects were 25 two-year-old females reared by their biological mothers and 15 same-aged females that were crossfostered at birth and reared by unrelated mothers. Subjects that were rejected more by their mothers in the first 6 months of life engaged in more solitary play and had lower CSF concentrations of 5-HIAA than subjects that were rejected less. The relation between these variables was generally similar in crossfostered and noncrossfostered females. CSF levels of 5-HIAA were negatively correlated with rates of scratching, a behavioural indicator of anxiety. These  suggest that that early exposure to high rates of maternal rejection can  in higher anxiety later in life, and that this effect may be mediated by serotonergic mechanisms. Variation in maternal protectiveness did not affect offspring behaviour and neither protectiveness nor rejection affected CSF levels of HVA and MHPG. CSF levels of MHPG, however, were negatively correlated with solitary play behaviour and avoidance of other individuals, suggesting that individuals with lower CSF MHPG were more fearful and socially phobic than those with higher CSF MHPG. Taken together, these findings suggest that individual differences in anxiety and fearfulness in young rhesus monkeys are accounted for, at least in part, by variation in CSF levels of monoamine metabolites, and that the development of brain monoamine systems, particularly serotonin, can be affected by early exposure to variable maternal behaviour.

Influence of parental tobacco dependence and parenting styles on adolescents' tobacco use,2007,"Objective > To  the influence of   and of porental smoking and nicotine dependence on their adolescent 's tobacco use. Methods > This  conducted in 2005, included 542 students from a French high school and 312 of their s. The student sample hod a mean age of 17 and 66% girls (n = 360). Tobacco consumption and dependence were assessed for s and students by the Fogerstrom test for nicotine dependence (FTND) and for the students only by the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist (HONC). Students were  asked about use of other psychooctive substances and completed the Authoritative  index (API).   were classified as authoritative, authoritarian, indulgent, or neglectful. Results > Although 70% of the girls and 72% of the boys hod tried smoking, only 12.5% were doily smokers. The mean FTND score was 1.3 (n = 156 respondents), and the mean HONC score 3.9 (n = 160). Fathers smoked more than mothers and hod a higher mean FTND score: 2.8 (n = 35) versus 1.7 m = 32) for mothers. Tobacco use by each  was correlated with that of the other (r = 0.49, p < 0.001). Adolescents' tobacco consumption was correlated with that of their s, especially their father and especially for boys (r = 0.86, p < 0.07). Age at starting smoking was associated with a young mother (r = 0.60, p < 0.001), while dependence (FTND) was associated with a young father. More broadly tobacco dependence was associated with both s' consumption and dependence, especially among girls. The use of other psychoactive substances was  associated with al tobacco dependence, especially that of fathers and especially for boys. Inebriation and marijuana use in girls were  associated with maternal tobacco dependence, but less significantly. An authoritative   tended to be associated with their 's less frequent tobacco consumption and less severe dependence, whereas neglectful and indulgent  were associated with more frequent consumption and greater dependence, the age at which boys begun smoking doily was linked to a maternal neglectful , and a paternal authoritarian  was associated with paternal tobacco dependence in boys and maternal dependence in girls. We  found this type of correlation for other psychoactive substances, in particular for inebriation and cannabis use, which decreased in families with on authoritative  . This  appears protective."
Parenting in youth sport: A position paper on parenting expertise,2015,"Objectives: In line with the aims of this special issue, the purpose of this paper is to forward a position on the concept of sport  expertise through the ation of six key postulates. Design: Literature review and position statement. Method: By adopting methods associated with an academic position paper, a statement is ed that we believe encapsulates sport  expertise. Six key postulates of  expertise, formulated from critically reviewing and interpreting relevant literature, are then ed. Results: We propose that sport  expertise is dependent on the degree to which s demonstrate a range of competencies; namely that s, (a) select appropriate sporting opportunities and provide necessary types of support, (b) understand and apply appropriate  , (c) manage the emotional demands of competitions, (d) foster healthy relationships with significant others, (e) manage organizational and developmental demands associated with sport participation, and, (f) adapt their involvement to different stages of their 's athletic career. Conclusion: Expertise in sport  requires s to develop knowledge and utilize a range of intrapersonal, interpersonal, and organizational skills in order to support their , manage themselves, and operate effectively in the wider youth sport environment. Recommendations for applied ers to further investigate these postulates and substantiate the components of sport  expertise are offered. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Mothers and fathers responded to questionnaires pertaining to their attributions concerning  behavior, their -rearing  and practices, and their daughters' problems. Results showed that adoptive s made as many positive attributions about 's behavior and reported fewer  problems than did biological s. They agreed about -rearing  and practices and al responsibility for 's negative behavior. Most s endorsed authoritative . Few differences between the two groups emerged. The higher incidence of psychological problems found among older adoptees does not appear to have roots in the No stage. (C) 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved."

The al management  of monitoring, guiding, prohibiting, and supporting all had significant paths in the model, whereas neutrality was not significant. Multiple group comparisons were used to examine whether   moderates the relation between al management of peers and the drug use outcomes.   functioned as a moderator for 7 of the paths in the model."
Chinese Parental Involvement and Children's School Readiness: The Moderating Role of Parenting Style,2020,"Research Findings: This  examined the moderating role of   in the relations between different dimensions of al involvement and their 's school readiness. A total of 311 Chinese s (Mean age = 35.74, SD = 4.61) and their kindergarten  (Mean age = 5.53, SD = .50) participated in this . s completed questionnaires about their demographic information,   and al involvement practices and teachers rated 's school readiness levels. Results indicated that s' home-based, school-based and home-school conferencing involvement were all positively related to 's school readiness. Home-based involvement showed stronger relationship to 's school readiness than the other two types of al involvement. In addition, authoritative  moderated the effects of both school-based involvement and home-school conferencing on 's school readiness. The effect of school-based involvement was enhanced in the context of high authoritative  . In contrast, the effect of home-school conferencing was decreased in the context of low authoritative  . Practice or Policy. The  suggest that programs designed for enhancing s' involvement in 's school readiness need to consider the emotional context that s create through their  . Implications for practice and suggestions for further  are offered."
"Exploring the associations between maternal personality,  temperament, and parenting: A focus on emotions",2009,"The goal of this  was to explore associations between maternal personality traits,  temperament characteristics, and   linked to the display and regulation of emotions. Specifically, we explored the moderating role of  temperament (shyness, emotional-dysregulation) in the relations between maternal personality (neuroticism, agreeableness) and  Style (authoritative, authoritarian, overprotective). Participants were n = 285 mothers of elementary  ( 145 boys, 140 girls, M-age = 75.61 months, SD = 10.85). Mothers provided ratings of their personality traits and  , and their 's temperament. Among the , the relation between maternal neuroticism and overprotective   increased among s of shyer . As well, maternal agreeableness was more strongly (negatively) associated with the use of a harsh/coercive   among s of more emotionally-dysregulated . (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PARENTING STYLE, PHYSICAL DISCIPLINE, AND ADJUSTMENT IN ADOLESCENTS' REPORTS",2013,"Recollections of physical discipline as absent, age-delimited (ages 2-11), or  into adolescence were associated with youths' evaluations of their mothers' and fathers'   and their own adjustment. Data were from the Portraits of American Life Study-Youth (PALS-Y) a diverse, national sample of 13- to 18-year-olds (N = 158). The modal experience of youth with authoritative s was age-delimited spanking; the modal experience of youth with permissive s was no spanking; the modal experience of youth with authoritarian or disengaged s was physical discipline into adolescence. The age-delimited group reported the best adjustment (less maladjustment than the adolescent group; greater competence than both other groups). The positive association between fathers' age-delimited spanking and youths' academic rank persisted even after accounting for  . The eschewing of spanking should not be listed as a distinguishing characteristic of authoritative , which was more often associated with age-delimited spanking than with zero-usage."
"Parenting, achievement strategies and satisfaction in ice hockey",2005,"The aim of this  is to understand adolescent players' satisfaction as a function of  , players' achievement strategies, and their norm breaking behavior. Finnish 14- and 16-year-old ice-hockey players (n= 1018) completed a questionnaire measuring their achievement strategies (SAQ; Nurmi, Salmela-Aro & Haavisto, 1995b), as well as scales of norm breaking and satisfaction, prepared for the  . The s (n= 979) filled in scales measuring their   (CRPR; Pulkkinen, 1996) and attitudes towards norm breaking. Results revealed that players from authoritative families who showed a high level of mastery-orientation expressed high satisfaction in playing ice hockey. Results  showed negative associations between authoritative  and both task irrelevant and norm breaking behavior. s with al stress and those with authoritarian   showed positive attitudes to norm breaking behavior, and players from authoritarian and al stress homes showed norm breaking behavior in ice hockey. There was no association between norm breaking behavior and player satisfaction. Our  contribute to the planning of a coaching system that serves more educational and developmental purposes, and that encourages the desire to play ice hockey as a hobby."
Parenting style moderates the effects of exposure to natural disaster-related stress on the neural development of reactivity to threat and reward in ,2019,"Little is known about the effect of natural disasters on 's neural development. Additionally, despite evidence that stress and  may both influence the development of neural systems underlying reward and threat processing, few studies have brought together these areas of . The current investigation examined the effect of   and hurricane-related stress on the development of neural reactivity to reward and threat in . Approximately 8 months before and 9 months after Hurricane Sandy, 74  experiencing high and low levels of hurricane-related stress completed tasks that elicited the reward positivity and error-related negativity, event-related potentials indexing sensitivity to reward and threat, respectively. At the post-Hurricane assessment,  completed a self-report questionnaire to measure promotion- and prevention-focused  . Among  exposed to high levels of hurricane-related stress, lower levels of promotion-focused, but not prevention-focused,  were associated with a reduced post-Sandy reward positivity. In addition, in  with high stress exposure, greater prevention-focused, but not promotion-focused,  was associated with a larger error-related negativity after Hurricane Sandy. These findings highlight the need to consider contextual variables such as  when examining how exposure to stress alters the development of neural reactivity to reward and threat in ."

Method Cross-sectional data from the population-based 'Water Campaign'  were used. s (n=644) of primary school  (6-13 years) completed a questionnaire covering sociodemographic characteristics, feeding  dimensions ('control over eating', 'emotional feeding', 'encouragement to eat' and 'instrumental feeding'),   dimensions ('involvement' and 'strictness') and 's unhealthy snacking behaviour. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine whether feeding  and   were associated with 's unhealthy snacking behaviour. Result Overall,  whose s had a higher extent of 'control over eating' had a lower odds of eating unhealthy snacks more than once per day (OR, 0.57; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.76). Further stratified analysis showed that 'control over eating' was associated with less unhealthy snacking behaviour only in  with a Dutch (OR, 0.37; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.68) or a Moroccan/Turkish (OR, 0.44; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.77) ethnic background. 'Encouragement to eat' was associated with a lower odds of eating unhealthy snacks every day in  with a Dutch ethnic background only (OR, 0.48; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.90). 'Instrumental feeding' was associated with a higher odds of eating unhealthy snacks more than once a day in  with a Moroccan/Turkish ethnic background only (OR, 1.43; 95% CI 1.01 to 2.04). Conclusion Our  suggest that 'control over eating' may be associated with less unhealthy snack consumption in . The associations of feeding  and   with 's unhealthy snacking behaviour differed between  with different ethnic backgrounds."
"The relationship between perceived parenting, adult attachment style and alexithymia in alcoholic inpatients",2006,"In this paper we examine the understudied relationship between alexithymia on the one hand, and adult attachment and perceived  on the other hand, in a clinical sample of alcoholic inpatients (N = 101). We test whether differences between a high and a low scoring group on trait alexithymia can be predicted on the basis of attachment  and perceived . We observed that the avoidant attachment  is a strong predictor. Subsequently we test whether three dimensions of alexithymia - affective, cognitive and social - are meaningfully linked to adult attachment and perceived . We noticed that cognitive alexithymia especially was predicted by the avoidant attachment  and a lack of warmth perceived in the relationship to the father. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

"Parenting styles, perceived social support and emotion regulation in adolescents with internet addiction",2019,"Aim: The aim of this  is to investigate al attitudes, perceived social support, emotion regulation and the accompanying psychiatric disorders seen in adolescents who, having been diagnosed with Internet Addiction (IA), were referred to an outpatient  and adolescent psychiatric clinic. Methods: Of 176 adolescents aged 12-17, 40 were included in the  group. These scored 80 or higher on Youngs Internet Addiction Test (LAT) and met Youngs diagnostic criteria for IA based on psychiatric interviews. Forty adolescents who matched them in terms of age, gender and socio-economic level were included in the control group. The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children (K-SADS-PL), the  Style Scale (PSS), the Lum Emotional Availabilty of s (LEAP), the Social Support Appraisals Scale for Children (SSAS-C), the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20) were applied. Results: The  showed that the s of adolescents with IA were more frequently inadequate in acceptance/involvement, supervision/monitoring and they had less emotional availability. The adolescents with IA had less perceived social support, greater difficulty in the identification and verbal expression of their feelings and emotion regulation. Lower al strictness/supervision, higher alexithymia and the existence of an anxiety disorder were found to be significant predictors of IA. Internet addicted adolescents with comorbid major depressive disorder had higher levels of alexithymia and lower levels of emotional availability in their s. Conclusion: It can be concluded that strategies for the prevention and treatment of IA in adolescents should focus on improving the quality of  -adolescent relationships, enhancing perceived social support and emotion regulation while reducing the associated psychiatric symptoms in adolescents.

The relationship between maternal self-efficacy and parenting practices: implications for parent training,2005,"The   examined the relationship between maternal self-efficacy, dysfunctional discipline practices and  conduct problems. Specifically, three levels of self-efficacy, global, domain and task-specific self-efficacy, were assessed in mothers of 2- to 8-year-old  with conduct problems (clinic group, n = 45) and non-clinic mothers from the community (non-clinic group, n = 79). Measures of global, domain and task-specific self-efficacy were completed by mothers. Clinic mothers reported significantly lower self-efficacy than non-clinic mothers for all but one of the  tasks assessed. Both groups of mothers reported lowest self-efficacy for similar  tasks. In the sample as a whole self-efficacy measures were significant predictors of maternal discipline  after controlling for other ,  and risk factors. Of the self-efficacy variables behavioural self-efficacy was the best predictor of mothers discipline . The findings support the importance of developing  strategies that enable s to generalize their  skills to a diverse range of diverse  contexts both in the home and in the community."
Family socialization of adolescent's self-reported cigarette use: The role of parents' history of regular smoking and parenting style,2007,"Objective To examine the main and interactive effects of al history of regular cigarette smoking and   on adolescent self-reported cigarette use. Methods Predictors of adolescent self-reported cigarette use, including s' history of regular cigarette smoking and two dimensions of  behavior, were analyzed in a sample of 934 predominately Caucasian (96.3%) -adolescent dyads. Families were drawn from the control group of a randomized control trial aimed at preventing adolescent substance use. Results In addition to the main effects of s' history of regular smoking and al warmth, logistic regression analysis revealed that the interaction of these two variables was associated with adolescent self-reported cigarette use. al warmth was associated with a decreased likelihood of the adolescent ever having smoked a cigarette; however, this was true only if neither  had a history of regular cigarette smoking. Conclusions Findings suggest that adolescent smoking prevention programs may be more efficacious if they address both al history of regular smoking and  behavior."
Does Tiger Parenting Exist? Parenting Profiles of Chinese Americans and Adolescent Developmental Outcomes,2013,"Tiger , as described by Chua (2011, Battle hymn of the tiger mother. New York, NY: Penguin Press), has put  in Asian American families in the spotlight. The current  identified  profiles in Chinese American families and explored their effects on adolescent adjustment. In a three-wave longitudinal design spanning 8 years, from early adolescence to emerging adulthood, adolescents (54% female), fathers, and mothers from 444 Chinese American families reported on eight  dimensions (e. g., warmth and shaming) and six developmental outcomes (e. g., GPA and academic pressure). Latent profile analyses on the eight  dimensions demonstrated four  profiles: supportive, tiger, easygoing, and harsh . Over time, the percentage of s classified as tiger s decreased among mothers but increased among fathers. Path analyses showed that the supportive  profile, which was the most common, was associated with the best developmental outcomes, followed by easygoing , tiger , and harsh . Compared with the supportive  profile, a tiger  profile was associated with lower GPA and educational attainment, as well as less of a sense of family obligation; it was  associated with more academic pressure, more depressive symptoms, and a greater sense of alienation. The current  suggests that, contrary to the common perception, tiger  is not the most typical  profile in Chinese American families, nor does it lead to optimal adjustment among Chinese American adolescents."
Parenting and Late Adolescent Emotional Adjustment: Mediating Effects of Discipline and Gender,2011,"Research suggests that   are related to the types of discipline s utilize and that the coupling of   and discipline techniques are related to  outcomes. Although extant  examines the effects of   and discipline on  and early adolescent adjustment, less is known about adjustment in late adolescents,  described as emerging adults. Thus, the current  investigated the relationships among   (e.g., authoritative, authoritarian, permissive), discipline strategies (e.g., non-violent discipline, psychological aggression, physical assault), and emerging adult emotional adjustment (e.g., self-esteem, depression, and anxiety). The sample consisted of 526 participants ranging in age from 18 to 22 years. Results were analyzed with structural equation modeling and suggest that, although perceived   and discipline are both correlated with emerging adult emotional adjustment, perceived  is associated with emerging adult emotional adjustment for females but not males when examined simultaneously with perceived discipline. This finding demonstrates the importance of examining the direct and indirect relationships in the context of gender dyads."
"Cultural Values, U.S. Neighborhood Danger, and Mexican American Parents' Parenting",2013,"To begin accounting for cultural and contextual factors related to  rearing among Mexican American s we examined whether s' Mexican American cultural values and perceptions of neighborhood danger influenced patterns of  behavior in two- Mexican-origin families living in the U. S. To avoid forcing Mexican American s into a predefined model of  , we used latent profile analysis to identify unique patterns of responsiveness and demandingness among mothers and fathers. Analyses were conducted using  self-reports on  and replicated with youth reports on mothers' and fathers' . Across reporters, most mothers and fathers exhibited a pattern of responsiveness and demandingness consistent with authoritative . A small portion of s exhibited a pattern of less-involved . None of the patterns were indicative of authoritarianism. There was a modicum of evidence for no nonsense  among fathers. Both neighborhood danger and s' cultural values were associated with the likelihood of employing one  of  over another. The value of using person-centered analytical techniques to examine  among Mexican Americans is discussed."
Promoting Optimal Parenting and Children's Mental Health: A Preliminary Evaluation of the How-to Parenting Program,2014," quality is widely accepted as a primary predictor of 's mental health. The   examined the effectiveness of a  program in fostering optimal  and  mental health. The selected program was How to talk so kids will listen & listen so kids will talk (How-to  Program). This program was selected because its content corresponds closely to what the   literature suggests is optimal  (i.e., includes structure, affiliation and autonomy support). Eleven groups of six to twelve s were conducted in 7 local grade schools. The program, offered by two trained leaders, consisted of eight weekly sessions and taught a total of 30 skills. A total of 82 s completed questionnaires both prior to and after the program. Participants'  between eight and 12 years old (N = 44) completed questionnaires at school, at both assessment points. Repeated measures ANOVAs using  reports indicated that structure, affiliation and autonomy support were increased after the program, compared to baseline. The level of  internalizing and externalizing problems  decreased significantly. Importantly,  reports confirmed that al autonomy support increased from pre to post-test and -reported well-being improved as well. The preliminary evidence from this pre-test versus post-test repeated measures design suggests that the How-to  Program is effective in improving   and in promoting 's mental health and that future evaluation  examining the potential of this program is warranted."
"Parental characteristics, parenting style, and behavioral problems among Chinese  with Down syndrome, their siblings and controls in Taiwan",2008,"Background/Purpose: The literature has documented maternal distress and behavioral problems among  with Down syndrome (DS), however, little is known about paternal adjustment and behavioral problems among the siblings of  with DS. Here, we examined al psychopathology,   and emotional/behavioral problems among  with DS, their siblings, and controls in Taiwan. Methods: We recruited 45 families of  with DS (age, 2-14 years) and 50 families of normally developing  (age, 3-15 years). If there were more than two  in the case family, the sibling whose age was closest to the  with DS was recruited (age, 3-18 years). Both s completed self-administered measures of their personality characteristics, psychopathology, family functioning,  , and  behavioral problems, using the Chinese versions of the Maudsley Personality Inventory, Brief Symptom Rating Scale, Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale, al Bonding Instrument, and Child Behavioral Checklist, respectively. Results: Children with DS demonstrated significantly more severe symptoms than normal  of a wide range of behavioral problems such as attention problems, delinquency, social problems, somatic complaints, thought problems, and withdrawal compared with the other two groups, and obtained similar al treatment, except for paternal overprotection. Their s suffered from more psychopathology and their mothers were less often employed than their counterparts. The siblings of  with DS obtained less overprotection from their mothers than  with DS and less maternal care and control than normal . There was no difference in emotional/behavioral problems between the siblings and normal controls. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that in addition to the physical, educational and psychological needs of  with DS, the psychological care of their mothers, fathers and siblings  needs to be evaluated. Moreover,  counseling should focus not only on  with DS, but their siblings as well."
Do Parents Benefit From Help When Completing a Self-Guided Parenting Program Online? A Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Triple P Online With and Without Telephone Support,2018,"In response to recent increases in the dissemination of Web based  supports, an important consideration is whether the core benefits of self-directed participation in online  interventions are counterbalanced by issues such as high dropout and noncompletion rates commonly reported within the Internet intervention literature. This  outlines a randomized controlled trial of Triple P Online, a Web-based variant of the Triple P Positive  Program, delivered with varied levels of support scaffolding. Participants were 183 s of  between 1 and 8 years of age with concerns about their 's behavior and at least one area of disadvantage or family difficulty. Participants were randomized to self directed Triple P Online, telephone-supported Triple P Online, or a wait-list control. Primary outcomes measured at baseline, postintervention, and 5-month follow-up were negative   and  behavior problems. Secondary outcomes included  confidence, anger, and adjustment; relationship quality; program engagement; and  satisfaction. Self-directed participants showed short-term treatment effects, including reductions in overall negative  and frequency of  behavior problems, while practitioner support led to greater improvements in negative  and intensity of difficult  behaviors. Participants in the supported condition were  more likely to complete modules and reported greater program satisfaction. At follow-up, 50% of outcomes for the self-directed condition were significantly better than the control, while 94% of outcomes were significantly better than the control in the practitioner-supported condition. Although self-directed online approaches to  intervention are promising, this  highlights how minimal support can improve effective engagement and enhance outcomes for families."
GENDER DIFFERENCES IN FACTORS RELATED TO PARENTING STYLE - A STUDY OF HIGH PERFORMING SCIENCE STUDENTS,1994,"This  examined   within the families of high performing science students and explored gender differences in the factors associated with an authoritative  . Participants in the  were 363 students who competed in the Canada-Wide Science Fair, 1992. Results showed that the authoritative   was predominant among participants and that few students were from families with permissive, authoritarian, or inconsistent  . Discriminant analysis indicated that the factors associated with authoritative  differed for male and female participants. A greater number of family-related variables emerged for females, whereas more motivational and science outcome variables emerged for males. Results  showed the positive effects of authoritative  because adolescents from this type of family showed higher levels of family cohesion, interaction, and encouragement as well as higher levels of achievement motivation and higher scores on a science outcome measure."
Associations between parenting style and attachment to mother in middle hood and adolescence,2003,"Associations between   and quality of -mother attachment in middle hood (n=202; grades 4-6) and adolescence (n=212; grades 7-11) were investigated. Participants rated warm involvement, psychological autonomy granting, and behavioural monitoring (Lamborn et al., 1991). Attachment orientation was assessed using the Network of Relationships Questionnaire (Furman & Buhrmester, 1985), Coping Styles Questionnaire (Finnegan et al., 1996), and Relationship Questionnaire (Bartholomew & Horowitz, 1991). Overall, a positive association was found between authoritative  (higher scores on all three dimensions) and secure attachment, whereas negligent  (lower scores on all three dimensions) predicted avoidant attachment. Moreover, a unique pattern of associations emerged between particular dimensions of  and each attachment . Findings suggests that psychological autonomy may have important implications for 's views of self whereas warm al involvement may play a unique role in their views of the attachment figure. Associations were largely consistent across both age groups."
CHINESE ADOLESCENTS PERCEPTIONS OF PARENTING STYLES OF FATHERS AND MOTHERS,1995,"Father Treated and Mother Treated subscales of the  Image Differential were used to assess recalled al treatment  of 2,150 Chinese secondary school students. Results from reliability and factor analyses showed that both scales were internally consistent, and two factors (Concern and Restrictiveness) were abstracted from each of these scales. The data on gender differences in  revealed significant differences, across socioeconomic classes, between paternal and maternal treatment , with the fathers perceived to be relatively more restrictive and showing less concern than the mothers. The data suggest that differences between paternal and maternal treatment  exist in the Chinese context but that signs of gradual change in the differences are appearing."
Substance Use in Early and Middle Adolescence. The Role of Academic Efficacy and Parenting,2019,"This  examines (i) the relationships between substance use and   and between substance use and perceived academic self-efficacy in early and middle adolescence, (ii) the importance of these factors in predicting adolescent substance use, and (iii) the role of academic self-efficacy in the relationship between   and adolescent substance use. The sample comprised 762 adolescents (53% boys) aged 12 to 16 years (M = 13.66, SD = 1.34). The sample was selected using probabilistic cluster sampling according to type of school (secondary, public vs. semiprivate) and school location in different areas of the city of Valencia (Spain). This approach accounted for different social strata of families. The  show that substance use and s' neglect are greater in middle adolescence than in early adolescence. Support and family communication and perceived academic self-efficacy are lower. Substance use is positively related to s' neglect, psychological control, and rejection. The relationships between neglect and psychological control and substance use are moderated by academic self-efficacy, and the relationship between psychological control and substance use is mediated by academic self-efficacy."
"Effects of gender difference and birth order on perceived parenting styles, measured by the EMBU scale, in Japanese two-sibling subjects",2000,"The relationship between Egna Minnen av Barndoms Uppforstran (EMBU) scaling and gender, birth order and s' gender was previously investigated in a large volunteer sample; significant interactions among the variables were found. In the  , 730 Japanese volunteers with one sibling were used as subjects in order to control the number of siblings: the effect of gender of subjects and siblings and birth order on the perceived   was examined. Based on gender and birth orders, 730 subjects were grouped into the following categories: (i) male with a younger brother; (ii) male with a younger sister; (iii) male with an older brother; (iv) male with an older sister; (v) female with a younger brother; (vi) female with a younger sister; (vii) female with an older brother; and (viii) female with an older sister. One-way ANOVA was performed with each EMBU subscale used as a dependent variable and these eight groups as independent variables. The scores for rejection and emotional warmth of father were influenced significantly by the pattern of siblings (P < 0.006 and P < 0.0012, respectively), and scores for emotional warmth of mother were influenced significantly by the pattern of siblings (P < 0.0012). The elder male  strongly experienced   as more rejecting than others, and female  (elder sisters with brother, or younger sisters with sister) recognized   as more caring and demonstrated more warmth than others. The  confirmed a significant interaction of gender of subjects and siblings and birth order of perceived al rearing behavior."
Racial-Ethnic Disparities in Maternal Parenting Stress The Role of Structural Disadvantages and Parenting Values,2013,"Although ers contend that racial-ethnic minorities experience more stress than whites, knowledge of racial-ethnic disparities in  stress is limited. Using a pooled time-series analysis of data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (n = 11,324), we examine racial-ethnic differences in maternal  stress, with a focus on structural and cultural explanations and variations by nativity and  age. In kindergarten, black mothers, albeit U.S.-born only, report more  stress than white mothers due to structural disadvantages and authoritarian  values. The black-white gap increases from kindergarten to third grade, and in third grade, U.S.-born black mothers' higher stress than white mothers' persists after controlling for structural and  factors. Hispanic and Asian mothers, albeit foreign-born only, report more stress than white mothers at both ages due to structural disadvantages and authoritarian values. Despite structural disadvantages, American Indian mothers report less stress."
High school students' goal orientations and their relationship to perceived parenting styles,2002,"The purpose of this  was to examine relationships among Baumrind's three  ,  involvement (both  variables as perceived by student), and mastery and performance goal orientations of high school students. The sample consisted of 196 students enrolled in two Florida high schools. Many expected relationships appeared in line with the  and goal theory literature. Maternal authoritativeness was related to a mastery orientation. Maternal authoritarianism and permissiveness were related to a performance orientation. Differential findings were evident with regard to student ethnicity. Appearance of stronger relationships among maternal   and student goal orientation may be due to the nontraditional living arrangements reported; a number of students reported not living with their fathers.  involvement was positively related to a mastery orientation for all students. Student gender and al education were not significant factors in this . Conclusions are tempered by limitations of a relatively small sample. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA)."
Parenting adolescents with cystic fibrosis: the adolescents' and young adults' perspectives,2011,"Background: When suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF), a number of problems may arise during adolescence; for example, poor adherence. The problems may be attributed to the adolescent being insufficiently prepared for adult life. Research on different ways of  adolescents with CF and the influence of different   on the adolescents' adherence to treatment is still limited. Aim: The aim of this  was to identify the types of al support that adolescents and young adults with CF want and find helpful in terms of preparing them for adult life. Methods: Sixteen Danish adolescents with CF, aged 14-25, participated in the . Two focus group interviews were carried out, one for 14-18-year-olds and one for 19-25-year-olds. Individual interviews were conducted, with three subjects. Using interpretive description strategy, a secondary analysis of the interview data was conducted. Results: The adolescents and young adults wanted their s educated about the adolescent experience. They wanted their s to learn a pedagogical  , to learn to trust them, and to learn to gradually transfer responsibility for their medical treatment. Additionally, the adolescents noted that meeting other s may be beneficial for the s. Conclusion: The findings of this  suggest that adolescents and young adults with CF want their s to be educated about how to handle adolescents with CF and thereby sufficiently prepare them for adult life."
The Role of Parental Style and Self-efficacy as Predictors of Internet Addiction among Israeli-Palestinian College Students in Israel,,"Prior studies have suggested the importance of individual characteristics among youths (e.g., self-efficacy) and s (e.g.,  ) that may mediate the risk of the youth engaging in compulsive, addictive behaviors like Internet addiction (IA). The current work was the first to examine the associations of IA with self-efficacy and   among a unique sample of Muslim college students in Israel. Participants (n = 500) reported on their symptoms of IA, self-efficacy, and their s'  practices. Consistent with the  hypotheses, authoritative   and self-efficacy were correlated with fewer symptoms of IA (r = -0.34, p < 0.01; r = -0.49, p < 0.01, respectively), whereas permissive and authoritarian   were correlated with elevated indicators of IA (r = 0.41, p < 0.01; r = 0.46, p < 0.01, respectively). These findings are consistent with previous literature in Western samples, suggesting the cross-cultural importance of these personal attributes for reducing the risk of addictive Internet use."
Adolescents' perceptions of paternal and maternal parenting styles in a Chinese context,1998,"Chinese secondary school students (N = 429) were asked to respond to instruments measuring their perception of s' global   and specific  practices. Results showed that there were significant differences between reported paternal  and maternal  characteristics, with fathers perceived as relatively less responsive, less demanding, less concerned, and more harsh. Adolescent girls' perceptions of fathers'  characteristics generally did not differ from those of the boys, but the girls tended to perceive their mothers as more demanding but less harsh. The  findings provide some support for the popular Chinese saying, strict father, kind mother, but they  suggest that it requires redefinition."
Determinants of harsh parenting in Mexico,1998,"This paper s a structural model of the determinants of harsh  among Mexican mothers. One hundred five mothers (46 from the community; 59 referred to agencies for  maltreatment) were recruited from Sonora (Northern) Mexico and interviewed. In this model the use of physical punishment was explained by (1) authoritarian   (mothers' beliefs concerning the effective use of physical punishment and mothers' lack of disciplinary skills) and (2) family dysfunction (a latent variable constructed from reports of interspousal violence and the s' use of alcohol and drugs). In addition, the indirect effects of demographic and historical variables on harsh  was included. The findings show that the most important factor influencing the use of physical punishment in these families was authoritarian  , exerting a significant direct effect on the mothers' reports of their use of harsh punishment.

Parental relational styles: A study with adolescents and their parents,2016,"Perceptions of   by s and their 12-year-old preadolescents are studied One hundred seven s and their adolescents enrolled in the first year of secondary education in one of four Catholic schools in Montevideo completed Affection, Rules and Requirements questionnaires. There were significant differences in  perception in the critical / rejection and inductive factor subscale, depending on the gender of the adolescent. Preadolescent perceptions exhibit significant differences in indulgent and affection scales for father, and in affection, indulgent and inductive scales for mothers. s with a primary school education level appear significantly more inductive than those who were are university graduates."

Perceived   were measured in Grade 7 (n = 749) and Grade 12 (n = 468), and values were measured in Grade 12 (n = 271) and one year postschool (n = 291). We measured three aspects of valuing: priority (extrinsic, intrinsic importance); regulation (controlled, autonomous); and successful enactment of values (success). Mothers' authoritative  in Grade 7 predicted increased importance and autonomous regulation of values one year postschool. Fathers' authoritative  in Grade 7 predicted decreased importance of extrinsic values. Fathers' permissive  in Grade 7 predicted decreased importance of intrinsic values.

Relationships between parenting styles and risk behaviors in adolescent health: An integrative literature review,2008,"Research over the past 20 years suggests that the quality of the -adolescent relationship significantly affects the development of risk behaviors in adolescent health. The purpose of this paper is to  a review of studies published between 1996-2007 that address specific relationships between   and six priority adolescent risk behaviors. The review supports the substantial influence of   on adolescent development. Adolescents raised in authoritative households consistently demonstrate higher protective and fewer risk behaviors than adolescents from non-authoritative families. There is  considerable evidence to show that   and behaviors related to warmth, communication and disciplinary practices predict important mediators, including academic achievement and psychosocial adjustment. Careful examination of   patterns in diverse populations, particularly with respect to physical activity and unintentional injury will be a critical next step in the development of efficacious, culturally tailored adolescent health promotion interventions."

There is a need to carry out controlled investigations regarding risk factors for early hood caries (ECC). Aim. To  the type of   and oral health practices as risk factors among  with ECC in an Indian preschool population. Methods. Two hundred and eleven  with ECC and equal number of controls participated in this case-control . A questionnaire was answered by s regarding oral health practices such as oral hygiene methods, feeding habits, daily sugar intake, and dental attendance pattern along with socioeconomic and demographic status. The   was determined using  Styles Dimension Questionnaire (PSDQ) index. Data were statistically analyzed using chi-square test and multiple logistic regression analysis. Results. Risk factors associated with ECC were higher birth order, lower socioeconomic status, non-use of fluoridated toothpaste, breast/bottle feeding for more than one year, presence of formula milk or milk with sugar in the feeding bottle while falling asleep, higher sweet scores in the diet chart, and visiting dentist only when a problem was perceived. Majority of s of  with and without ECC had authoritative  . Conclusion. Improper oral health practices are the risk factors for ECC. The association of   with ECC could not be confirmed."
"How Do I Love Thee? Let Me Count the Ways: Parenting During Adolescence, Attachment Styles, and Romantic Narratives in Emerging Adulthood",2011,"In this longitudinal , a quantitative and qualitative examination of the associations among   relations, adult attachment , and relationship quality and theme in romantic narratives was conducted.  and adult attachment  were assessed through questionnaires, whereas overall quality of romantic relationships (regard and importance), intimacy, and romantic story theme were examined with a life story approach (McAdams, 1993). At ages 17 and 26 years, 100 participants completed a series of questionnaires and , at age 26, told a story about a relationship-defining moment with a romantic partner.   relations when participants were 17 years old were related predictably to all three attachment . About 70% of the sample told romantic stories with a true love type of theme. Associations between   relations when the  was 17 and this type of theme in the story told when the participant was 26 were mediated by a more secure (and a less avoidant) attachment  when the participant was 26, as predicted. The implications of these findings for links between attachment models and the life story are discussed."
"Concurrent and longitudinal associations among parenting style, responsibility, and adherence in youth with Cystic Fibrosis",2020,"In an effort to identify pathways for improvements in clinical monitoring and intervention, the current  investigated the role that   plays in treatment adherence and responsibility for youth with CF. Participants (n = 50) completed questionnaires related to treatment adherence, treatment responsibility, and   at baseline and at a two year follow up visit. Aspects of   (e.g., warmth, autonomy support) were related to youth adherence and responsibility in cross-sectional and prospective analyses.

"The relationship between gambling attitudes, involvement, and problems in adolescence: Examining the moderating role of coping strategies and parenting styles",2016,"Introduction: Several factors are associated with an increased risk of adolescent problem gambling, including positive gambling attitudes, higher levels of gambling involvement, ineffective coping strategies and unhelpful  practices. It is less clear, however, how these factors interact or influence each other in the development of problem gambling behavior during adolescence. The aim of the current  was to simultaneously explore these predictors, with a particular focus on the extent to which coping skills and   may moderate the expected association between gambling involvement and gambling problems. Methods: Participants were 612 high school students. The data were analyzed using a zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression model, controlling for gender. Results: Although several variables predicted the number of symptoms associated with problem gambling, none of them predicted the probability of displaying any problem gambling. Gambling involvement fully mediated the relationship between positive gambling attitudes and gambling problem severity. There was a significant relationship between gambling involvement and problems at any level of problem focused coping, reference to others and inconsistent discipline. However, adaptive coping  employed by adolescents and consistent disciplinary practices by s were buffers of gambling problems at low levels of adolescent gambling involvement, but failed to protect adolescents when their gambling involvement was high. Conclusions: These findings indicate that  exploring the development of gambling problems is required and imply that coping and  interventions may have particular utility for adolescents who are at risk of development gambling problems but who are not gambling frequently.

Looking at teacher practices through the lens of parenting style,2008,"In this article, the author used a   framework to explain mixed evidence about the influence of teacher practices on student outcomes. Participants included 3 fifth-grade math teachers and 45 of their students. The author assessed teacher practices, teaching  (i.e., demandingness and responsiveness), student engagement, self-efficacy, and standardized achievement test scores. The most academically and socially competent students were those who experienced an authoritative teaching  (i.e., consistent classroom management, support of student autonomy, and personal interest in students). The author found disengagement and limited ability beliefs in the authoritarian context (i.e., consistent classroom management but limited autonomy support and limited personal interest in students). She found smaller academic gains in the permissive context (i.e., inconsistent management, autonomy support, and interest in students)."

Maternal Parenting Mediate the Relationship between Maternal Psychopathic Traits and Child Callous-Unemotional Traits: A Longitudinal Multiple Mediation Model,2020,"The current  aimed to examine themediationrole of   (i.e., authoritative and authoritarian) in the relationship between maternal psychopathic traits and  callous-unemotional (CU) traits. A longitudinal  design was adopted using a sample of 486 Chinese mothers and  dyads in which  were between the ages of 8 and 11 years. The data was collected at three time points: mother-reported maternal psychopathy traits at Time One (T1), and  at Time 2 (T2), and at Time 3 (T3). Both the mother and the  reported on the 's CU traits. The structural equation modeling (SEM)  revealed that the relation between maternal psychopathic traits and mother-reported  CU traits was fully mediated by maternal authoritarian and authoritative , however, themediationof maternal authoritarian was on the edge of significance and authoritative  was not significant with the -reported outcome. These findings indicate that maternal psychopathic traits influence  CU traits through authoritarian  , while themediationof authoritative   on  CU traits exists only in mother-reported measures. The different findings in cross-informant  between mother and  provide implications for future interventions in that the multiple informant approach is effective in comprehensively assessing  CU traits."

Helicopter Parenting Style and Parental Accommodations: The Moderating Role of Internalizing and Externalizing Symptomatology,2021,"High al involvement has been linked to positive outcomes; however, helicopter  may  in negative outcomes. The behaviors demonstrated by helicopter s resemble al accommodations, which are behavior modifications intended to alleviate their 's distress. The current  examined the relation between helicopter  and al accommodations, while  examining  internalizing and externalizing symptomatology as possible moderators. s (N= 400) of  (ages 4-11) from across the United States completed surveys and rating scales. s, who endorsed higher levels of helicopter , endorsed significantly higher levels of accommodations than s who endorsed lower levels of helicopter . Results suggested helicopter  differed depending on the types of accommodations provided. This  provides additional clarity for the construct of helicopter  and suggests that s higher in this construct may exhibit difficulties related to accommodating their 's diagnostic symptoms."
"A comparison of gender, age, grade, and experiences of authoritarian parenting amongst traditional and cyberbullying perpetrators",2018,"In this , we explore the differences between learners who perpetrate cyberbullying and traditional bullying in Gauteng with regard to their sociodemographic characteristics and the level of self-reported, authoritarian  they experienced. This  was conducted on Grade Six and Seven learners from four primary schools in Benoni, Gauteng (N = 279). Pupils completed an adapted version of the Revised Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire (R-OBVQ) and items from the  Practices Questionnaire (PPQ), which measured the authoritarian  . Results revealed that grade was significantly associated with both traditional and cyberbullying perpetration; Grade Six learners were significantly more likely to have perpetrated traditional bullying behaviours, chi(2) (3, N = 272) = 9.26, p < .05, and Grade Seven learners were more likely to have perpetrated cyberbullying behaviours, chi(2) (1, N = 272) = 5.96, p < .05. Age was significantly associated with cyberbullying perpetration only, with older learners more likely to perpetrate such behaviours, chi(2) (2, N = 272) = 9.24, p < .05. Both types of bullying were significantly related to self-reported, authoritarian , therein suggesting that this   is more prevalent in the households of bullying perpetrators."
Perceived parenting and adolescents' adjustment,2018,"Adolescence is an important developmental period that is characterised by heightened problems of adjustment. The aim of this  is to analyse adolescents' adjustment, and to explore the typologies and dimensions of , and thus to determine the relationships between these factors. The sample comprised 1285 adolescent students aged 12 to 16 from the Basque Country (Spain). The students filled out the self-report of the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC) and the al Acceptance-Rejection/Control Questionnaire, (PARQ/Control). Differences by age were found in the adolescents' school maladjustment and   perception. Moreover, perceptions of little al warmth were related to higher levels of clinical and school maladjustment, and the lower the al control, the greater the clinical maladjustment. Finally, the  obtained revealed that the interaction between the mothers' and fathers'   was significant only for clinical maladjustment; those students with neglectful mothers and authoritative fathers ed the highest level of clinical maladjustment, followed by other combinations of neglectful mothers. Furthermore, the students from neglectful and authoritarian families ed the highest levels of school maladjustment, without differences between neglectful and authoritarian or between indulgent and authoritative families."
"Parenting styles, motivational orientations, and self-perceived academic competence: A mediational model",1998,"A mediational model is examined that stipulates motivational orientations as mediators between   and self-perceived academic competence. Three separate pathways were hypothesized: authoritarian  leading to extrinsic motivation, authoritative  to intrinsic motivation, and neglectful  to amotivation. These different motivational orientations were in turn related to self-perceived academic competence. The participants of this  were 404 Grades 8 and 9 high school students of both sexes in Hong Kong. Testing by multiple regression and structural equation modeling largely confirmed our mediational model. One significant modification to the original model was an extra pathway from authoritarian  to amotivation, suggesting that the former had a more generalized negative impact on motivation."
A Test of Parenting Strategies,2013,"The status attainment literature suggests that the educational success of s determines the educational success of their  (Blau and Duncan, 1967). However, the mechanisms by which families determine a 's education are imperfectly understood. This article tests Lareau's (2003) al typology to identify the association between  strategies and educational outcomes achieved using the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE) 2004-2006. The findings suggest that class is not a convincing predictor for  , but that use of concerted cultivation  strategies does improve the young person's chances of achieving five GCSEs grade A*-C. These  strategies are  a positive predictor of how much a young person enjoys school, a teacher's perception of their progress in school, their own perceptions of progress in school, their likelihood to apply to university, and whether they believe they will be accepted if they apply."
Social withdrawal in  moderates the association between parenting styles and the 's own socioemotional development,2014,"BackgroundSocial withdrawal in early hood is a risk factor for later socioemotional difficulties. This  examined the joint effects of 's social withdrawal and mothers' and fathers'   on 's socioemotional development. Based on diatheses-stress, vantage sensitivity, and differential susceptibility models, socially withdrawn  were assumed to be more prone to al influences than others. MethodsTeachers rated 314  on prosocial skills, and internalizing and externalizing behaviors at three points in time between grades 1-3. Mothers (n=279) and fathers (n=182) filled in questionnaires measuring their affection, and their behavioral and psychological control at the same points in time. Teacher reports on 's level of social withdrawal were obtained at the end of kindergarten. ResultsPanel analysis showed that particularly those  who showed signs of social withdrawal were vulnerable to the negative effects of low maternal affection in terms of externalizing behavior. Moreover, among these , mothers' and fathers' psychological control predicted high levels of internalizing problem but, at the same time, mothers' psychological control predicted  a high level of prosocial behavior and low levels of externalizing problem. ConclusionsThe  supported the diathesis-stress model more than the differential susceptibility model. For example, socially withdrawn  were found to be particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of low maternal affection. Although maternal psychological control had positive effects on the prosocial skills of socially withdrawn , and reduced the amount of externalizing problems, it was at the same time associated with an increase in their internalizing problems. In this way, socially withdrawn  seem to be at risk of pleasing their mothers at the cost of their own well-being."
"Parental and  fruit consumption in the context of general parenting, parental education and ethnic background",2012,"This  examines the association between al and  fruit consumption in the context of general , al education and ethnic background. A cross-sectional  was performed among 1762 - dyads. Mean age of the  was 8 years. One  completed a questionnaire to measure their own and their 's fruit consumption,  , education level and ethnicity. In mediation and moderation analyses,  fruit consumption was regressed on al fruit consumption,  , al education and ethnicity. Participating  consumed on average 7.5 pieces of fruit per week. Fourteen percent met the recommended Dutch norm of two pieces of fruit per day. al and  fruit consumption were positively associated. The association was more pronounced under higher levels of psychological control and behavioural control, and among ethnic groups. Additionally, al education and  fruit consumption were positively associated. al fruit consumption partially mediated this association. Interventions are needed to increase  fruit consumption. Interventions should focus on increasing al fruit consumption and positive al modelling, with particular focus on low-SES families. Additionally, interventions that combine positive modelling with positive general  skills (e.g. increasing behavioural control) may be more effective than interventions that focus on al modelling alone.

Personality and Job Stress: A Comparison of Direct Effects on Parenting,2011,"The impact of personality and job characteristics on al rearing  was compared in 353 employees. Hypotheses concerning the relationships between personality and job variables were formulated in accordance with findings in past  and the Belsky's model (1984). Structural equation nested models showed that Aggression-hostility, Sociability and job Demand were predictive of Rejection and Emotional Warmth  , providing support for some of the hypothesized relationships. The findings suggest a well-balanced association of personality variables with both  : Aggression-Hostility was positively related to Rejection and negatively to Emotional Warmth, whereas Sociability was positively related to Emotional Warmth and negatively related to Rejection. Personality dimensions explained a higher amount of variance in observed  . However, a model that considered both, personality and job dimensions as antecedent variables of  was the best reation of observed data, as both systems play a role in the prediction of  behavior."
The Adverse Influence of Permissive Parenting on Personal Growth and the Mediating Role of Emotional Intelligence,2016,"In this  the presumed negative associations between permissive  and both adolescents' emotional intelligence and personal growth were examined. Previous studies have demonstrated a positive association between emotional intelligence and personal growth as well as a negative association between permissive  and personal growth. The authors extend previous  by testing a hypothesized process model through which permissive  negatively predicts scores on an ability measure of emotional intelligence that, in turn, predicts personal growth. The  indicated that emotional intelligence is both negatively associated with permissive  and that individual differences in emotional intelligence predict increased personal growth. In addition, we found that permissive 's negative influence on subsequent personal growth is mediated by emotional intelligence. It is suggested that permissive  might adversely influence the development of emotional intelligence by limiting both the number of challenging emotional experiences and the extent to which s directly facilitate emotional growth."
Parenting styles and adolescents' learning strategies in the urban community,1998,The purpose of this  is to examine the relationship between perceived   and urban adolescents' learning and ing strategies.

Implications are discussed for counselors and teachers using this information as a fostering tool in their work with urban adolescents.
Helicopter parenting and alcohol use in adolescence: A quadratic relation,,"Aims: Research has underscored that an excessively intrusive al , defined as helicopter , could be a risk factor for maladaptive behaviours in youth, including alcohol use and drug consumption. However, such at-risk behaviours have  been associated with low levels of al involvement and warmth. Thus, the relationship between al involvement and at-risk behaviours in adolescents is not clear. The purpose of the current  was to identify the relation between helicopter  and alcohol use in a sample of Italian youth. Design: The participants were 402 adolescents (233 female) between the ages of 14 and 19 years (M (age)= 17.20, SD = 1.66). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine linear, quadratic, and exponential models and to verify which model best described the correlation. Results: The  showed a quadratic correlation between mothers' helicopter  and alcohol use, whereby higher and lower levels of mothers' helicopter  were associated with adolescents' alcohol use. Conclusions: The empirical data are essential for improving our understanding of the implications and potential outcomes of helicopter  during adolescence."
"Optimal Assessment of Parenting, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Reporter Disagreement",2016,"The purpose of this  was to examine differences and similarities across ratings of  by preadolescents, s, and observers. Two hundred forty-one preadolescents rated their s on warmth and harshness. Both mothers and fathers self-reported on these same dimensions, and observers rated each s' warmth and harshness during a 10 min interaction task with the preadolescent. For the majority of outcomes assessed, the differences between preadolescent, , and observer ratings accounted for significant amounts of variance, beyond the levels accounted for by the average of their reports. A replication sample of 929 mother- dyads provided a similar pattern of . This methodology can help standardize the  of reporter differences, supports modeling of rater-specific variance as true score, and illustrates the benefits of collecting  data from multiple reporters."
Do Psychological Characteristics of Mothers Predict Parenting Stress? A Cross-Sectional Study among Mothers of Children with Different Disabilities,2018,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: We aimed at assessing the  stress levels among mothers of  with different disabilities and its association with various mothers' psychological characteristics. METHODS: In this cross-sectional , 302 mothers of 6-12 years old  suffering from sensory motor mental, chronic physical and psychological disabilities were enrolled.  stress, coping stratyles, marital satisfaction and psychological problems of mothers were assessed using validated questionnaires. RESULTS: In this , mothers of 302  with sensory-motor mental (n = 64), psychological (n = 149) and chronic physical (n = 89) disabilities were investigated. Mean total score of  stress was significantly higher in mothers of  with psychological disabilities (F = 4.285, P < 0.05). There was positive significant relationship between emotion oriented coping  and  stress scores (beta = 0.56, P < 0.05).  stress had significant negative association with marital satisfaction (beta = -0.3, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated different  stress levels among mothers of  with different disabilities. Mother's psychological characteristics such as marital satisfaction, psychological problems and coping  are significant determinants of  stress. These findings provide baseline information for designing future interventional studies and developing more effective approaches for managing the  stress."
Authoritarian parenting predicts reduced electrocortical response to observed adolescent offspring rewards,2017,"  are robust predictors of offspring outcomes, yet little is known about their neural underpinnings. In this , 44 -adolescent dyads (M-age of adolescent = 12.9) completed a laboratory guessing task while EEG was continuously recorded. In the task, each pair member received feedback about their own monetary wins and losses and  observed the monetary wins and losses of the other member of the pair. We examined the association between self-reported   and s' electrophysiological responses to watching their adolescent winning and losing money, dubbed the observational Reward Positivity (RewP) and observational feedback negativity (FN), respectively. Self-reported authoritarian  predicted reductions in s' observational RewP but not FN. This predictive relationship remained after adjusting for sex of both participants, s' responsiveness to their own wins, and al psychopathology. 'Exploratory analyses found that permissive  was associated with a blunting of the adolescents' response to their s' losses'. These findings suggest that s' rapid neural responses to their 's successes may relate to the harsh  behaviors associated with authoritarian ."
Relation between suicidal ideation and parenting styles among a group of Chilean adolescents,2011,"Background: In Chile, there has been an increase in suicide rates from 1.1 to 2.6 per 100,000 among adolescents aged 10 to 14 years and from 4.4 to 8.9 per 100,000 among those aged 15 to 19 years Aim: To identify protective factors for suicidal ideation according to  , as described by Barber et al. Material and Methods: The relation between suicidal ideation and   was assessed in a random sample of 2,346 Chilean school attending adolescents aged 13 to 20 years old (59% women) from three cities: Antofagasta (Northern Chile, II Region), Santiago (Central, Metropolitan Region) and Concepcion (Southern, VIII Region).

Exploring Parenting as a Predictor of Criminogenic Thinking in College Students,2014,"Crime-promoting cognitions and attitudes, globally labeled as criminogenic thinking, are shown to perpetuate maladaptive and antisocial behavior in criminals and nonoffenders. In the nonoffender population, these thinking patterns may not lead to illegal behavior, but can  in irresponsible or maladaptive behavioral consequences. Theories suggest that early hood - interactions may be partly responsible for the development of criminogenic thinking. While the relationship between  and antisocial behavior is well documented, the connection between  and the development of criminogenic thinking  has not yet been explored. The current  examined the nature of the relationship between exposure to  behaviors and subsequent criminogenic thoughts in a nonoffender, college population. The sample included 119 undergraduates. Results indicate that  may affect general criminogenic thinking as well as specific types of criminogenic thinking . Relevance and importance of the findings with regard to clinical work and  are  discussed."

Why do Adolescents Gather Information or Stick to Parental Norms? Examining Autonomous and Controlled Motives Behind Adolescents' Identity Style,2010,"Self-determination theory (SDT) distinguishes between autonomous and controlled reasons for people's behavior and essentially states that beneficial effects for individuals' psychosocial adjustment will accrue when behavior is guided by autonomous (rather than controlled) motives. The   tested this assumption in the area of adolescents' identity . In a sample of mid-adolescents (N = 247; 53% female), it was found that the motives for using an information-oriented or a normative identity  explained additional variance beyond the identity  as such in two of the adjustment outcomes examined. Specifically, autonomous motives underlying these two identity  were positively related to commitment and personal well-being, whereas controlled motives were negatively related to these same adjustment outcomes. Perceived autonomy-supportive  was examined as a possible antecedent of the motives behind identity . Consistent with hypotheses, it was found that autonomy-supportive  was positively related to autonomous motives and negatively to controlled motives underlying identity . Implications for future  on the motivational dynamics behind identity development are discussed."
"Adult Attachment, Implicit Motives, and Mothers' and Fathers' Parenting Behaviors",2019,"The current  investigated connections between implicit motives of power and affiliation, adult attachment , and  behaviors using self-report and observational data from 191 mothers, fathers, and their 12-month-old infants. An interaction between avoidant attachment and nAffiliation indicated that implicit affiliation motives predicted positive maternal behaviors, but only for highly avoidant mothers. For fathers, lower attachment anxiety and nPower were associated with positive  behaviors, whereas high levels of attachment anxiety and nPower were associated with negative  behaviors. Attachment  of avoidance and anxiety, as well as implicit motives of power and affiliation, were unique predictors of  behaviors. Overall, the findings suggest that  behaviors in the first year of infancy are predicted by s' working models of attachment and implicit motives of affiliation and power."
Parenting and Child Behaviour Barriers to Managing Screen Time With Young Children,2021,"The impact of excessive screen use on  health and development is now a public health concern, and  efforts are focused on finding ways to moderate screen use. To date, the focus has mainly been on school-aged  and adolescents, and the early hood context has been comparatively neglected. Moreover, relationships between factors likely to influence screen use by young  (e.g.,  behaviour,   and self-efficacy) remain largely unexplored. Our  aimed to test relationships between  , s' self-efficacy, al distress,  behaviour, and young 's screen time. We used a cross-sectional  design. s (N = 106) of young  (aged 0-4 years) living in Australia completed an online survey which assessed -reported  screen use, screen time-related  behaviour problems, s' self-efficacy for managing  behaviour and screen time, s' beliefs about the positive/negative effects of screen time,  , general  adjustment and  efficacy, and  distress. Correlation coefficients revealed relationships between dysfunctional  , screen time-related  behaviour problems, and  self-efficacy for dealing with these behaviours. Using hierarchical multiple regression models, 's screen time behaviour problems explained the greatest variance in s' self-efficacy for managing screen time, and s' self-efficacy for managing  screen time explained the greatest variance in -reported  screen time. Further  is needed to disentangle these relationships; however, preliminary  suggest that  behaviour difficulties and s' self-efficacy warrant further investigation as potentially useful targets for interventions aiming to improve screen use in early hood."
Parenting practices among parents of  with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: Gender-related differences,2020,"Objective: Further  is needed on  practices among s of  with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as these practices impact 's development and outcomes. This  analyzes these practices, distinguishing between s' and 's gender. Method: al warmth (affection-communication and criticism-rejection responses) and control (inductive, strict, and indulgent discipline ) were assessed in both s of 81  diagnosed with ADHD (aged 6-17 years). Results: Mothers reported greater affection-communication responses and use of inductive disciplinary practices than fathers. Higher use of maternal strict practices was associated with female , regardless of their age, subtype, medication, or comorbidities. However, al practices used with male  were affected by 's age and subtype. Conclusions: Warmth levels and discipline  used by s of  with ADHD may differ depending on the gender of both s and .

"Exploring Correlation Between Perceived Parenting Styles, Early Maladaptive Schemas, and Depression Among Women With Depressive Symptoms in Iran and India-Role of Early Maladaptive Schemas as Mediators and Moderatos",2014,"Background: Many studies have reported that inadequate al  can contribute to depressive symptoms through dysfunctional cognitive . Objectives: This  aimed to investigate the association of dysfunctional schemas and   with depression, as well as the role of maladaptive schemas such as moderators and mediators in Iran and India. Patients and Methods:: The  sample was selected randomly and consisted of 200 (age group 16-60 y) depressed females (mild to moderate); 100 from Tehran (Iran) and another 100 from Pune (India). The type of the  was causal-comparative. The data collection took place in hospitals and clinics in the targeted cities. Descriptive statistic tests and hierarchical multiple regression were executed (for the purpose of analyzing data) by SPSS 17. Results: It was demonstrated that the association between  and depression was not moderated by early maladaptive schemas. On the contrary, the  supported meditational models in which   are associated with the cognitive schemas, and these in turn are related to depressive symptoms. It was  found that abandonment mediates the impacts of maternal  on depression in Iran. On the other hand, abandonment and punitiveness schemas mediated the relation between paternal  and depression in India. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the correlation between hood experiences and depression in adulthood are mediated by dysfunctional schemas."
Parenting style and conduct problems in : A report of deliberate self-poisoning in a Nigerian ,2011,A correlation between unhealthy   and  psychopathology has been established.

This report is intended to stimulate the interest of physicians and psychiatrists in    and in how   modification can be a therapeutic and preventive tool.
Children With Cochlear Implants and Their Parents: Relations Between Parenting Style and Children's Social-Emotional Functioning,2017,"Objectives:  a  who has a severe or profound hearing loss can be challenging and at times stressful, and might cause s to use more adverse   compared with s of hearing .   are known to impact 's social-emotional development. Children with a severe to profound hearing loss may be more reliant on their s in terms of their social-emotional development when compared with their hearing peers who typically have greater opportunities to interact with and learn from others outside their family environment. Identifying the impact which   pertain on the social-emotional development of  who have cochlear implants (CIs) could help advance these 's well-being. Therefore, the authors compared   of s with hearing  and of s with  who have a CI, and examined the relations between   and two key aspects of 's social-emotional functioning: emotion regulation and empathy. Design: Ninety-two hearing s and their  (aged 1 to 5 years old), who were either hearing (n = 46) or had a CI (n = 46), participated in this cross-sectional . s completed questionnaires concerning their   (i.e., positive, negative and uninvolved), and regarding the extent to which their  expressed negative emotions (i.e., anger and sadness) and empathy. Furthermore, an emotion-regulation task measuring negative emotionality was administered to the . Results: No differences in reported   were observed between s of hearing  and s of  with a CI. In addition, negative and uninvolved   were related to higher levels of negative emotionality in both groups of . No relation was found between positive  and 's social-emotional functioning. Hearing status did not moderate these relationships. Language mediated the relationship between   and 's social-emotional functioning. Conclusions: Children's hearing status did not impact  . This may be a  of the support that s of  with a CI receive during their enrollment in the rehabilitation program preceding and after implantation. Rehabilitation programs should dedicate more attention to informing s about the impact of  behaviors on 's social-emotional functioning. Offering  courses as part of the program could promote 's well-being. Future longitudinal  should address the directionality of the relations between   and 's social-emotional functioning."
Parenting practices among Dominican and Puerto Rican mothers,2007,"This  s descriptive qualitative data about Latino  practices in an urban context. Focus groups were conducted with Dominican and Puerto Rican mother-adolescent pairs in the Bronx borough of NewYork City. When   typologies are integrated with the Latino cultural components familismo, respeto, personalismo, and simpatia, Latino  practices and their underlying  are better understood. Content analysis of s' focus groups revealed five essential Latino  practices: (1) ensuring close monitoring of adolescents; (2) maintaining warm and supportive relationships characterized by high levels of -adolescent interaction and sharing; (3) explaining al decisions and actions; (4) making an effort to build and improve relationships; and (5) differential  practices based on adolescents' gender. Mothers reported concerns related to the risks associated with living in an urban area, exposure to different cultural values, and opportunities for engaging in risky behaviors. Adolescents' recommendations for effective  strategies were similar to the practices reported by their mothers. The  has important applied implications for culturally competent social work practice with Latino adolescents and their families."
Influence of paternal general parenting on Latino early adolescents' energy balance-related behaviours and interactions with behaviour-specific parenting practices,2021,"Objective: To investigate the influence of general  dimensions on adolescents' energy balance-related behaviours (EBRB) and its interactions with behaviour-specific  practices based on Darling and Steinberg's contextual model of  . Design: Multiple linear regression analyses and the Hayes PROCESS procedure to analyse self-reported cross-sectional survey data. Setting: In-person survey. Participants: Latino early adolescents and their fathers (n 225 dyads) recruited using convenience sampling from metropolitan areas of north-central USA. Results: Both paternal  dimensions of warmth and autonomy granting were positively associated with adolescents' fruit intake, vegetable intake and physical activity. Coercive control was positively associated with adolescents' sugary drink intake and sweets/salty snack intake. These associations were predominantly mediated by the  practices of setting expectations/allowances, role modelling, and managing availability and accessibility for corresponding EBRB. After adjusting for  practices, paternal warmth was inversely associated with adolescents' screen time, paternal autonomy was positively associated with sugary drink intake, and both paternal warmth and autonomy granting were positively associated with adolescents' fast food intake. In addition, positive associations between fathers'  practices and adolescents' sugary drink intake were significantly stronger among those who perceived high v. low levels of paternal warmth and autonomy granting. Conclusions: Paternal warmth and autonomy granting showed mixed effects on adolescents' EBRB, and coercive control showed undesirable relationships with adolescents' dietary intake via interactions with behaviour-specific  practices. Life intervention programmes for Latino adolescents need to consider incorporating paternal  education components."
Coddling Our Kids: Can Parenting Style Affect Attitudes Toward Advergames?,2013,"This  examined s' understanding of and experience with -targeted advergames through exploratory interviews and quantitative pretests of an advergaming definition. Exploratory findings revealed that s tended to overgeneralize when identifying advergames. Through the use of an online survey, this   examined how al socialization  affect s' attitudes toward advergames. As predicted,  indicate that authoritarian and authoritative s hold more negative perceptions toward advergames compared to indulgent s, while all   exhibited negative leanings toward advergaming as a practice. These findings indicate the efficacy of al socialization theory in explaining s' perceptions and attitudes toward this new form of advertising-advergames. We discuss important implications for regulators, practitioners, and s."
"Relations of perceived maternal parenting style, practices, and learning motivation to academic competence in Chinese ",2008,"A measure of academic  practices was developed through  and teacher interviews and subsequently, administered to 91 Hong Kong Chinese fifth graders, who  rated their mothers' restrictiveness and concern, school motivation, and self-perceived academic competence. Children's actual school grades were obtained from school records. The new measure of  practices exhibited satisfactory factorial validity and reliability. Perceived   of concern and restrictiveness, although theoretically independent, were highly associated. Perceived maternal practices of support and encouragement explained unique variance in 's learning motivation, Achievement demands, together with restrictive  , explained 's actual academic performances. Children's mastery motivation, but not maternal socialization practices and , explained 's perceived competence. Findings are in line with existing models of family interaction (e.g., Kagitcibasi, 2005) and underscore the importance of specific  practices as well as general   in explaining different socialization outcomes in  (Darling & Steinberg, 1993)."
Perceptions of Differential Parenting between Southern United States Mothers and Fathers,2018,"Little  has examined how  practices may differ in various regions of the United States, specifically the South. The current  used a Southern United States sample to replicate prior  done in Central Florida, a proximal yet distinct region. Participants included 4900 emerging adults attending a Southern United States university who were aged 18 to 25 years (M = 18.87; SD = 1.22) and identified themselves as female (66.6%), male (33.4%), Caucasian (74.8%), African American (20.2%), Asian (1.9%), Latino (1.2%), or Other (1.9%). Participants answered questionnaires regarding their perceptions of maternal and paternal   and their own internalizing and externalizing problems using an online survey. Results indicated that perceptions of   across region varied as a function of  gender, such that s, particularly mothers, were more authoritarian in the Southern sample. Moreover, latent profile analysis produced two perceived mother-father dyad  profiles: (1) congruent maternal and paternal   and (2) a high authoritative and authoritarian mother coupled with an extremely high authoritarian and authoritative father. Emerging adults, especially males, reported higher externalizing problems in profile 1 and internalizing problems showed the same non-significant trend. The combination of high perceived authoritative and authoritarian  found in profile 2 along with lower associated externalizing problems strongly suggests that context plays a significant role in how  is associated with outcomes."
Interaction Between Parenting Styles and Adrenarcheal Timing Associated With Affective Brain Function in Late Childhood,2018,"Objective:  and pubertal timing have consistently been associated with internalizing and externalizing symptoms in hood and adolescence, and there is some evidence that the interaction between these factors may be important in conferring risk. However, few studies have investigated whether neurobiological factors mediate these relationships. The current  examined whether interactions between adrenarcheal timing and   were associated with affective brain function and, in turn, mental health difficulties. Method: Participants were 88 healthy  (46 female and 42 male, mean age 9.42 years, SD = 1.08 years), with 45 classified as relatively early and 43 as relatively late in adrenarcheal development based upon adrenal hormone levels. Participants completed an affective face functional magnetic resonance imaging task, and s reported on 5   and on  internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Results: Negative   (corporal punishment and poor monitoring) were associated with brain hemodynamic response while viewing affective faces in several subcortical and lateral prefrontal regions, and adrenarcheal timing and/or sex moderated most of these relationships. Sex differences in associations between corporal punishment and brain activation to affective faces indicated that late females might show less adaptive affective neural function when more exposed to this  . Conclusion: Findings suggest that the interaction between   and adrenarcheal timing is associated with affective brain function in late hood, with marked sex differences. Further longitudinal  with larger samples is needed to corroborate and expand upon these findings."
An Evaluation of the Efficacy of a Triple P-Positive Parenting Program Podcast Series,2014,"Objective:  programs based on cognitive-behavioral and social learning principles are effective in changing  behavior problems and  . However, such programs typically have limited population reach. The current  aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a brief radio series that provided  advice based on the Triple P-Positive  Program. Method: One hundred thirty-nine s of  aged 2 to 10 years who had concerns about their 's behavioral and/or emotional adjustment were recruited, randomly assigned to either an intervention or waitlist control group, and completed online self-report measures. s in the intervention group were given access to seven Triple P podcasts online over a period of 2 weeks. Results: s in the intervention group improved significantly more than s in the control group, from pre- to postintervention, on measures of  behavioral problems and  , self-efficacy, and confidence. These short-term intervention effects were maintained at the 6-month follow-up. Conclusion: These  suggest that brief radio and online  programs can be effective and have the potential to reach a large proportion of s experiencing  behavior problems. Limitations, clinical significance, and future  suggestions are discussed."
Understanding the association between authoritative parenting and adolescent smoking,2006,"Background: Research on adolescent cigarette smoking has attempted to measure the role of s in preventing smoking experimentation and uptake. However, aspects of al influence have often been limited to al smoking behavior or antismoking socialization. Only a limited number of studies considered the hypothesis that the influence of  on adolescent current cigarette smoking may extend beyond al behavior and antismoking socialization to consider broader measures of the - relationship, such as  . Methods: The sample was nationally reative and included 17,287 high school students nationwide. Data were used to categorize the  -authoritative, permissive, autocratic, and unengaged-experienced by each respondent. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between   and adolescent current cigarette smoking. Results: Authoritative  was associated with a reduction in the odds of adolescent current cigarette smoking (OR: 0.74, 99% CI: 0.58, 0.95). When authoritative  is simultaneously considered with believing s' opinions about smoking are important, authoritative  was no longer a significant correlate of adolescent current cigarette smoking, while believing s' opinions about smoking are important was associated with a 45% (99% CI: 0.48,0.64) reduction in the odds of adolescent current cigarette smoking. Authoritative  was associated with a more than three-fold increase (OR: 3.65, 99% CI: 2.87, 4.66) in the odds of believing s' opinions about smoking are important. Discussion: Interventions may want to educate s about authoritative , which includes the importance of having appropriate and routine conversations with their , requiring chores, and implementing general rules and boundaries."
Early parenting and 's relational and physical aggression in the preschool and home contexts,2006,"This  investigated early - relationships and how 's use of relational and physical aggression varies with aspects of those relationships during the preschool years.

Distal and proximal parenting as alternative parenting strategies during infants' early months of life: A cross-cultural study,2009,"Cultures differ with respect to  strategies already during infancy. Distal , i.e., face-to-face context and object stimulation, is prevalent in urban educated middle-class families of Western cultures; proximal , i.e., body contact and body stimulation, is prevalent in rural, low-educated farmer families. s from urban educated families in cultures with a more interdependent history use both strategies. Besides these cultural preferences, little is known about the relations between these  as well as the behavioural systems constituting them. In this  therefore, the relations between the  and the constituting behaviours were analysed in samples that differ with respect to their preferences of distal and proximal . The hypothesized differences between the samples and the negative relationship between distal and proximal , as well as between the respective behavioural systems can clearly be demonstrated. Furthermore, the impact of the sociodemographic variables with respect to the  strategies can be shown. Results were discussed as supporting two alternative  strategies that serve different socialization goals."
"Parenting Practices and Child Behaviour Problems in Hong Kong: Knowledge of Effective Parenting Strategies, Parenting Stress, and Child-Rearing Ideologies",2016,"The   examined the effects of knowledge of effective  strategies,  stress and Chinese -rearing ideologies, on  practices and  behaviour problems among Hong Kong Chinese s. s of  aged between 2 and 10 years were recruited through a selection of kindergartens and primary schools across Hong Kong. A total of 106 Hong Kong Chinese s (76 % mothers and 24 % fathers) participated in the  by completing an online questionnaire. s ranged in age from 25 to 53 years (M=37.25; SD=5.65). Key outcome measures examined in the   include al nurturance, dysfunctional  and  behaviour problems. Findings revealed that  stress was the strongest predictor of al nurturance, dysfunctional  and  behaviour problems. Chinese -rearing ideologies did not predict any al behaviour or  behaviour. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed."
Mindfulness In Parenting Questionnaire (MIPQ): Development and Validation of a Measure of Mindful Parenting,2017,"The aim of the   was to develop and psychometrically evaluate a measure of mindful  (the Mindfulness In  Questionnaire (MIPQ)) for use with s of  and adolescents, ranging in age from 2- to 16-years-old. Content experts assisted in item development, and cognitive interviewing was used to revise the measure. s (N = 203) completed the preliminary MIPQ along with measures of  ,  practices, and mindfulness. The contemporary psychometrics approach known as the item response theory (IRT) was used to evaluate the MIPQ. Results yielded two dimensions, each of which was measured optimally using the partial credit model. The two dimensions, mindful discipline and being in the moment with the , explained 42.3 and 43.4 % of the variance, respectively. Correlations between the MIPQ and  ,  practices, practice of mindfulness, and participant demographics provided support for construct validity. The MIPQ exhibited a positive and weak correlation with the MAAS, indicating that interpersonal and intrapersonal mindfulness are related yet separate and distinct constructs. Limitations and directions for future  are discussed."
The Influence of Authoritative Parenting During Adolescence on Depressive Symptoms in Young Adulthood: Examining the Mediating Roles of Self-Development and Peer Support,2010,"A diverse sample of 1,143 high school seniors and 182 students who were part of the same cohort but who left high school without graduating were interviewed during late adolescence (Time 1 [T1]) as well as 2 (Time 2 [T2]) and 4 years later (Time 3 [T3]). Perceived self-development, peer support, and prior levels of depressive symptoms (T2) were hypothesized to mediate the relationship between authoritative  during adolescence (T1) and depressive symptoms during young adulthood (T3). T2 sense of self as worthy and efficacious and depressive symptoms, but not peer support, fully mediated the effect of authoritative  on T3 depressive symptoms. The authors discuss the importance of  for healthy, emerging adult self-development and the continuing influence of   during adolescence on young adult depressive symptoms."
Parenting stress and marital relationship as determinants of mothers' and fathers' parenting,2013,"Using the actor-partner interdependence model, we explore how various sources of stress and support experienced by fathers and mothers influence their own   and the   of the partner. Data from 227 couples were analyzed, with mothers and fathers rating their  stress and marital relationship and  rating the   of both mothers and fathers. Structural equation models revealed actor effects of  stress on demanding and responsive  , as well as partner effects between positive aspects of marital relationship and responsive  . The  further indicate that the strength of these pathways is similar for both mothers and fathers and do not support the hypothesis that the  of fathers is more vulnerable than the  of mothers."
Victimized Children's Adjustment Difficulties: The Role of Parenting Styles and Parents' Childhood Peer Victimization Status,2017,"The purpose of the   was to examine the role of s' hood victimization status in the associations among   and victimized 's depression and anxiety. Participants were 203 s (86% mothers; M age = 43.75, SD = .76) and their  in the fourth or fifth grade (n = 203; 56% female; M age = 9.74, SD = .34). Children completed measures on peer victimization, their perceptions of their s'  , depression, and anxiety, while s completed a measure on their hood peer victimization while in elementary school. s' hood peer victimization status moderated relationships among authoritarian and permissive   and victimized 's adjustment difficulties. These findings highlight the importance of considering s' experience of hood peer victimization and its impact on their   and their 's adjustment difficulties."
Differential Influences of Parenting Dimensions and Parental Physical Abuse during Childhood on Overweight and Obesity in Adolescents,2017,"Besides other explanatory variables,   and al violence might  be responsible for setting a path towards overweight/obesity in hood. While this association has consistently been observed for adults, findings for adolescents still remain scarce and inconsistent. Therefore, the goal of this  is to add evidence on this topic for  and adolescents. Analyses are based on a sample of 1729 German, ninth-grade students. To analyze associations between  dimensions and weight status, non-parametric conditional inference trees were applied. Three gender-specific pathways for a heightened risk of overweight/obesity were observed: (1) female adolescents who report having experienced severe al physical abuse and medium/high al warmth in hood; (2) male adolescents who report having experienced low or medium al monitoring in hood; and (3) this second pathway for male adolescents is more pronounced if the families receive welfare. The importance of promoting   characterized by warmth and a lack of physical abuse is  discussed. This is one of only a few studies examining the association of  dimensions/al physical abuse and weight status in adolescence. Future studies should include even more  dimensions, as well as al physical abuse levels, in order to detect and untangle gender-specific effects on weight status."

Fathering Styles: Qualities Children Expect in Their Fathers,2020,"Many fathers strive to be better s. Yet it remains unclear what qualities contribute to effective fathering; less is clear about how such paternal efforts are viewed by their . Based on theoretical frameworks and previous qualitative studies that assessed father roles, a set of father role items was developed to assess undergraduate students' views of their fathers (n = 1,208). Factor analysis revealed two distinctive aspects of fathering quality: considerateness (friendly, supportive and -centered) and traditionalism (authoritarian, disciplinarian and provider). A path analysis revealed directional and relative effects of these two dimensions on perceived fathering quality. Further, based on these two distinctive dimensions, four fathering  were developed, which predicted 's developmental outcomes. Ways of improving paternal  are discussed."

On the other hand, the adaptation  of the  version has been conducted on the basis of the data gathered from 250 s who have adolescent . Results: Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted with four scales for the adolescents to rate the behaviors of their mothers and fathers. The Scale's coefficients for internal consistency in the adolescent-mother version are calculated 0.88 for responsiveness, 0.58 for behavioral control, 0.81 for psychological control, and 0.72 for autonomy granting; while, in the adolescent-father version the corresponding outcomes are 0.91, 0.78, 0.77, and 0.67. On the other hand, the coefficients for internal consistency with regard to LAPPS  version are found to be 0.75 for responsiveness, 0.66 for behavioral control, 0.82 for psychological control and 0.63 for autonomy support. Conclusion: The  findings indicate that both versions of the Scale have satisfactory levels of reliability and validity."
The Predictive Strength of Perceived Parenting and Parental Attachment Styles on Psychological Symptoms among Turkish University Students,2016,"This  aims to investigate the relationships between perceived , al attachment  and psychological symptoms among Turkish university students and it  aims to find out which perceived  and al attachment  predict psychological symptoms which were measured. This  is a quantitative  and uses causal comparative  design. The sample of this  consists of 400 university students. Young  Inventory, al Bonding Instrument and Brief Symptom Inventory were used for gathering data. The depressive, hostility and anxiety symptoms were determined as the most prevalent psychological symptoms among the sample. The conditional/achievement-oriented and ruling/former mother perceptions were found as the most prevalent perceived   for mother and the conditional/achievement-oriented and close/repressed feelings perceived as   for father. Pessimistic/fearful mother, belittling/captious mother and overprotective/worrywart father were found as the most predictive perceived   which predict the psychological symptoms in a significant level and in a positive way."
Parenting Intervention Combined with Acceptance and Commitment Therapy: Processes of Change,2019,"Objectives We report an investigation into processes of change in a randomized controlled trial of Stepping Stones Triple P (SSTP) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for families of  with cerebral palsy (CP). In comparison with the control group, the SSTP-only group showed improvements in  behavior problems and emotional symptoms and the SSTP-plus-ACT group showed benefits in  behavior problems,  hyperactivity, dysfunctional  ,  functional performance in the mobility domain,  quality of life, and al adjustment. Methods Sixty-seven s of  with CP were randomly allocated to one of three groups: waitlist control, SSTP-only and SSTP-plus-ACT groups. We investigated three potential processes of change:  , al attitude to  emotion, and al psychological flexibility. We used bootstrapping to perform the mediation analysis. Results Contrary to the existing literature, we find that neither dysfunctional   nor al attitude to  emotion were significant mediators of the intervention effect on  behavior and adjustment. Consistent with existing literature, we find that psychological flexibility mediates the intervention effect on dysfunctional   (over-reactivity confidence interval [CI] = -0.4750 to -0.115) and al adjustment (depressive symptoms CI = -6.5641 to -0.5922; stress CI = -6.0546 to -0.4195). Conclusions Overall, our findings support the conclusion that ACT makes a unique contribution to  intervention."
"PARENTING STYLES IN ADOLESCENCE: THE ROLE OF WARMTH, STRICTNESS, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL AUTONOMY GRANTING IN INFLUENCING COLLECTIVE SELF-ESTEEM AND EXPECTATIONS FOR THE FUTURE",2009,"A large corpus of evidence shows the effectiveness of authoritative , in comparison with authoritarian, neglectful, and indulgent educational , on adolescents' personal and social development. However, few studies have examined the influence of authoritative  on adolescents' social identity and future plans. In this contribution (N = 400) we examined the role of warmth, strictness, and autonomy granting the core dimensions of  in influencing adolescents' social identity, measured as family collective self-esteem, and expectations for the future, in terms of stable intimate relationships and fulfillment of personal goals. We  tested the role of family collective self-esteem in mediating the influence of   dimensions on expectations for the future. Besides confirming that authoritative  leads to better outcomes than the other educational , this  sheds light for the first time on the distinct contribution of different  dimensions on adolescents' social identity and expectations for the future."
Self-Regulation as a Mediator for the Relationship Between Parenting and the Development of Behavior Problems and Social-Emotional Competences in Elementary School Children,2020,"The impact of   on the development of externalizing behavior problems and social-emotional competences in  has been highlighted in numerous studies. Yet, there are only a few findings on the explanatory mechanisms for these relationships. Children's self-regulation skills are proposed to mediate the relationship between  and  development. The increasing ability to self-regulate emotions, cognitions, and behavior at preschool age is associated with behavior problems and competences. However, 's self-regulation can be influenced by  . The aim of the   is to examine 's self-regulation skills as a possible mediator for the relationship between   and the development of social-emotional competences and behavior problems. Three  . namely, love, severity, and autonomy, were hypothesized to predict the level of self-regulation skills in , which in turn predicts the development of externalizing behavior patterns (aggressive behavior and hyperactivity/inattention) and social-emotional competences (social competence and emotion knowledge/empathy). Path analyses were conducted with longitudinal questionnaire data from 445  and their families. The first data collection phase took place at preschool, and the second at elementary school. The analyses were performed using bootstrapped full information maximum likelihood estimation with STATA 14. The  show an indirect positive effect of love and autonomy on the development of social-emotional competencies (and a negative effect of severity) mediated by 's self-regulation skills. Also, severity indirectly promotes the development of externalizing behavior problems and inhibits the development of social-emotional competences. In this context, self-regulation skills re a mediator for the association between  and  development. In addition, s' educational level influences  , indicating that especially  from less educated households can benefit from early preventions or interventions. These should aim to raise awareness about   and strengthen 's self-regulation skills. As self-regulation plays an important role in the development and maintenance of different behavior problems, its role as a transdiagnostic factor is discussed. The findings suggest that promoting self-regulation skills can reduce various problem behaviors and reinforce social-emotional competences."
Peer referencing in adolescent decision maeing as a function of perceived parenting style,2003,"This  examined the relationship between   and adolescent decision making. Two hundred sixty-two college students completed a decision-making scale as well as a  scale in an effort to determine if the -rearing  of their s was related to the tendency of these late adolescents to reference peers rather than s or other adults in decision making. The  indicated that adolescents raised by authoritative s tended to refer to their s for moral and informational decisions, while adolescents raised by authoritarian, permissive, or neglecting-rejecting s more often referenced their peers for moral and informational decisions. Adolescents referred to their peers for social decisions regardless of how they were raised. al responsiveness was a significant factor in determining the source of adolescent decision-making assistance, but al demand-ingness was not. It was concluded that less orientation toward peers during late adolescence seems to be another advantage of authoritative ."
"The association of parenting practices with toddlers' dietary intake and BMI, and the moderating role of general parenting and  temperament",2020,"Objective: The objective was to examine the association between  practices, toddler's dietary intake and BMI. In addition, potential moderation of these associations by general  and  temperament was examined. Design: The current cross-sectional  assessed  practices using the Comprehensive Feeding Practices Questionnaire, general  using the Comprehensive General  Questionnaire,  temperament using the Child Behavior Check List, and 's dietary intake through al questionnaires. Children's weight and length were objectively measured to determine BMIz-scores. Associations were examined using multiple linear regression analyses. Moderation was examined using interaction terms. Setting: Home setting. Participants: 393 Dutch toddlers (age 1-3 years) and their s recruited through fifty care centres and preschools in the Netherlands. Results: Various practices were related to 's diet and BMI. For instance, the availability of healthy foods is the most important predictor of healthy dietary intake (e.g.beta= -0 center dot 35 for sweets;beta= 0 center dot 18 for fruit). The association of availability with a healthier diet was strongest when s scored low on the positive   dimensions, including nurturance, structure and/or behavioural control. In addition, it seemed that a high availability of healthy foods and low availability of unhealthy foods is especially beneficial for  showing withdrawal/depressive, anxious or overactive behaviour, while encouraging balance and variety is not beneficial for these . All other practices were related to 's diet and/or BMI as well. Conclusions: The findings underline the importance of viewing the impact of  practices in the context of general  and  temperament."
"RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PARENTING, ALEXITHYMIA AND ADULT ATTACHMENT STYLES: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY ON A GROUP OF ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS",2017,"Objective: Recent literature underlines the relationship between alexithymia and dysfunctional patterns of affective involvement in the family, demonstrating that early caregiver's sensitivity and responsiveness to 's emotions are important determinants of the regulation of distressing emotions and relationships with others. The purposes of this  were the following: to investigate the relation between , alexithymia and adult attachment ; to measure the predictive variables of the adult attachment-related anxiety and avoidance. Method: The participants were 140 students, of which a group of 71 high school students (M=16.59, S.D=0.67), and a group of 69 university students (M=19.04, S.D=1.50). All participants completed the al Bonding Instrument, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20, and the Experience in Close Relationships. Results and conclusions: In the male group, al control seems to influence almost all alexithymia subscales, although maternal care and paternal control do not affect the tendency to externally oriented thinking. In the female group, all alexithymia dimensions seem to be influenced by  except the father's control. Our  are consistent with the hypothesis that alexithymia could develop in response to interactions with primary caregivers, which could  influence infant and adult attachment."
The Influence of Maternal Parenting Style on the Neural Correlates of Emotion Processing in Children,2020,"Objective: The importance of  in influencing mental health outcomes, particularly depression, during hood and adolescence is well known. However, the mechanisms are unclear. Emotion processing impairments in  are believed to be influenced by negative  behaviors and fundamental to depression. As such, investigating the association between  behavior and the neural underpinnings of emotion processing in  could provide fundamental clues as to the link between  and depression. Method: Eighty-six  (49 girls, mean age 10.1 years), as part of a longitudinal , participated. Observational measures of maternal behavior were collected during 2 mother- interactions. Children underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing an implicit emotionprocessing task, and measures of  internalizing symptoms were collected. Results: Maternal negative behavior exhibited during an event-planning interaction was associated with decreased activation in the lingual gyrus in girls, whereas maternal negative behavior during a problem-solving interaction was associated with increased amygdala activation in the entire sample during processing of angry and fearful faces. Maternal communicative behavior during the 2 mother- interactions was associated with increased activity in the bilateral middle orbitofrontal cortex in the entire sample. Negative behavior during the problem-solving interaction was associated with connectivity between the amygdala and superior parietal lobe. Brain activity/connectivity was not related to internalizing symptoms. Conclusion: Results suggest that, in , maternal behavior could be associated with activity in brain regions involved in emotion processing. However, more  is needed to elucidate the link among , emotion processing, and depressive symptoms in young people."
"FAMILY WORLDS - COUPLE SATISFACTION, PARENTING STYLE, AND MOTHERS AND FATHERS SPEECH TO YOUNG-CHILDREN",1992,"The relations between some family context variables and the conversational behavior of 36 mothers and fathers engaged with their 3.5-year-olds in play were investigated. Transcripts were coded for types of conversational functions and structure of  speech. To assess family functioning, independent ratings were obtained of   and couples' reports of marital satisfaction. Mothers' and fathers' conversational  were similar. Predicted correlations of  speech functions with   were found. Variations in maternal conversational responsiveness to  at age 3.5 predicted 's verbal academic outcomes at age 5.5. Marital satisfaction was associated with aspects of  speech, demonstrating the importance of attending to family context in the  of language development."
"Associations Between Parenting Factors, Motivation, and Physical Activity in Overweight African American Adolescents",2018,"Background Positive  practices and environmental supports have been linked to physical activity (PA) levels in youth, yet factors associated with positive   have been understudied in African American adolescents. Purpose This  expands on previous literature by examining associations between motivation,  factors associated with Self-Determination Theory's psychological needs (competence, autonomy, and relatedness) including authoritative , autonomy support and emotional and tangible support, and adolescent moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and light PA (LPA). Methods Participants were African American adolescents (N = 148; M-age = 13.6 years; M-BMI% = 96.6) and their caregivers (M-age = 43.4 years; M-BMI = 37.4) enrolled in the Families Improving Together for Weight Loss trial.  factors were measured using self-report surveys, and PA minutes were measured using 7-day accelerometry estimates. Results Regression analyses indicated that overall models for MVPA (F(11,134) = 4.35; R-2 = 0.26) and LPA (F(11,134) = 5.84, R-2 = 0.32) were significant. Adolescent motivation for PA (B = 0.58, SE = 0.16) was positively associated with MVPA minutes. Authoritative  (B = 15.71, SE = 4.38) and tangible support (B = 8.53, SE = 4.02) were positively associated with adolescent LPA minutes. Unexpectedly, emotional support was negatively associated with both MVPA (B = -0.47, SE = 0.17) and LPA (B = -11.22, SE = 4.79), with follow-up analyses showing this relationship stronger in males. Conclusion Findings highlight the importance of adolescent motivation for PA on MVPA and positive   and tangible supports on adolescent LPA in overweight African American youth. Recommendations for integrating these factors within the context of intervention studies are discussed."
How mothers' parenting styles affect their 's sexual efficacy and experience,1998,"The relations among mothers'   and adolescents' sexual self-efficacy and sexual experience were examined in a sample of 253 British adolescent-mother pairs. Also explored was whether adolescents' self-efficacy would be positively or negatively related to their sexual experience, Mothers'   were expected to influence 's locus of control, based on the theory that mothers who are involved with their  and mothers who stress independence contribute to the development of an internal locus of control in their , increasing the 's feelings of sexual self-efficacy. Structural equation modeling was used to test a longitudinal model. The  support the assumption that maternal involvement leads to higher levels of self-efficacy, whereas maternal control was associated with lower levels of self-efficacy. Sexual self-efficacy was associated with higher levels of sexual experience. Implications and limitations of the  are discussed."
"Androgen levels, parenting styles and aggressive behavior in 5-6-year-old boys and girls",2009,"This  explores the relationship between androgen levels,  , and physical, verbal, and indirect aggression measures in 5-6-year-old . 129  (60 boys and 69 girls) were assessed in relation to their aggression levels using a peer-rating technique. s completed the  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire, from which the different   were obtained. Testosterone, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were measured using an enzymoimmunoassay technique ill saliva samples. A regression analysis indicated that the directive mother-androstenedione interaction at the age of 5 was predictive of physical aggression at the age of 6. In specific terms, the  showed that, in boys with high androstenedione levels, directive maternal behavior is associated with physical aggression. The  are subsequently discussed in light of postulates related to  characteristic of developmental psychology and we suggest a potential link of our  with the hypothesis of maternal dominance."
"Peer Attachment, Perceived Parenting Style, Self-concept, and School Adjustments in Adolescents with Chronic Illness",2016,"Purpose: The purpose of this  was to identify how peer attachment and   differentially affect self-concept and school adjustment in adolescents with and without chronic illness. Methods: A cross-sectional  using multiple group analysis on the Korean panel data was used. A nationwide stratified multistage cluster sampling method was used and the survey was conducted in 2013 on 2,092 first-year middle school students in Korea. We used standardized instruments by the National Youth Policy Institute to measure peer attachment,  , self-concept, and school adjustment. Multiple-group structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the difference of relations for peer attachment,  , self-concept, and school adjustment variable between adolescents with chronic illness and those without chronic illness. Results: The model fit of a multiple-group structural equation modeling was good. The difference of the path from negative   to self-concept between the two groups was significant, and a significant between-group difference in the overall path was found. This indicated that self-concept in adolescents with chronic illness was more negatively affected by negative   than in adolescents without chronic illness. Conclusions: Healthcare providers can promote the process of school adjustment in several ways, such as discussing this issue directly with adolescent patients, along with their s and peers, examining how the organization and content of the treatment can be modified according to the adolescents' school life.

"Gifted Students' Perceptions of Parenting Styles: Associations With Cognitive Ability, Sex, Race, and Age",2013,"Children whose s are warm and responsive yet  set limits and have reasonable expectations for their  tend to have better outcomes than their peers whose s show less warmth and responsiveness, have low expectations, or both.  behavior is related to family race and 's sex, age, and cognitive ability. However, there is no work that examines how 's cognitive abilities are related to their perceptions of their mothers' and fathers'   and the extent to which these relationships are moderated by race, sex, and age in a sample of gifted students. Participants (N = 332, ages 9-17 years) attended a summer residential program for gifted students and completed the al Authority Questionnaire and the verbal battery of the Cognitive Abilities Test. Three main findings emerged. First, factor analyses provided support for the use of the  Authority Questionnaire with gifted populations. Second, findings from regression analyses as well as examinations of mean differences by cognitive ability level were consistent with earlier studies suggesting that more cognitively able students were likely to perceive their s as employing a flexible (i.e., authoritative)  . Finally, consonant with earlier studies with nonidentified populations, age, sex, and race were associated with   as reported by this group of identified gifted students. Results provide further support for the notion that authoritative  promotes positive outcomes for , particularly those who have been identified as gifted."
What is the optimum parental socialisation style in Spain? A study with  and adolescents aged 10-14 years,2010,"The aim of this   was to analyse the optimum al socialisation  in Spain as measured by the 's psychosocial adjustment. A sample of 948  and teenagers from 10 to 14 years of age, of whom 52% were females, reported on their s' -rearing practices Families were classified into one of four classic typologies (authoritative, authoritarian, indulgent, or neglectful) based on 's answers to the al Acceptance-Rejection/Control Questionnaire (Rohner, 1990). Socialisation outcome was assessed using five self-esteem indicators of the AF5 Multidimensional Self-Concept Scale (Garcia & Musitu, 1999), six psychological adjustment indicators of the Personality Assessment Questionnaire (Rohner, 1990), three indicators of personal competence, and three of behaviour problems (Lamborn et al., 1991). The  showed that indulgent and authoritative   were associated with better outcomes than either authoritarian or neglectful . Overall, our  indicated that an indulgent  is the optimum al  in Spain, as the test scorer of  and teenagers from indulgent families were always equal to or even higher than those of  from authoritative families."
"Adolescent Psychological Development, Parenting Styles, and Pediatric Decision Making",2010,"The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child risks harm to adolescents insofar as it encourages not only poor decision making by adolescents but    that will have an adverse impact on the development of mature decision-making capacities in them. The empirical psychological and neurophysiological data weigh against augmenting and expression of the rights of . Indeed, the data suggest grounds for expanding al authority, not limiting its scope. At the very least, any adequate appreciation of the moral claims regarding the authority of s with respect to the decision-making capacity of adolescents needs to be set within an understanding of the psychological and neurophysiological facts regarding the development of adolescent decision-making capacity."
Understanding the Influence of Traditional Cultural Values on Indonesian Parenting,2017,"The aim of this conceptual article is to consider the available literature regarding associations between cultural values and  in Indonesian society. Research focusing on  in the Indonesian context is limited, although there are extensive studies regarding  and its implications for  development in Western cultures. Indonesia is one of the most heavily populated and culturally diverse countries in the world, with more than 200 ethnicities reed. Because cultural values are likely to influence Indonesian  and, therefore,  development, there is a need to understand the ways in which Indonesian traditional cultural values influence  . In this article the small amount of literature regarding  specifically in Indonesian culture is over-viewed. The key outcome of this article is to highlight the need to better understand how cultural values influence  in Indonesia and, in turn, how these influence  outcomes, particularly under conditions of some cultural change. Recommendations for future  regarding associations between Indonesian cultural values and  are provided to stimulate more empirical attention to this area to support Indonesia's adaptation to the modern global environment."
Parenting Styles of Parents Who Had Children With and Without High Risk at Birth: A Cross-sectional Comparative Study,2020,"Introduction   plays a major role in  development by influencing cognitive, social-emotional development, academic performance, and behavioral problems. These characteristics are fairly stable right into adulthood. The influence of risk factors in  on the   of mothers and fathers has not been studied in developing countries. Aims and methods The aim of this  is to determine the   of mothers and fathers of  (312 years) born with and without high risk and to analyze the influence of this on  . This is an analytical, cross-sectional, comparative . Sixty-four out of 90 s of  who have been newborn intensive care unit (NICU) graduates, with moderate to severe risk factors at birth as per the National Neonatology Forum guidelines of India, and 73 s of  without risk factors at birth were enrolled. A   and dimension questionnaire was used. The commonest   in mothers and fathers and a correlation between   and risk factors in  at birth were identified. Results Baseline characteristics were comparable between the high-risk and non-high-risk groups. Eighty percent of mothers and 70% of fathers followed the authoritative  . There was no significant correlation between risk factors and gender, family type or socioeconomic status and the  . Lack of follow-through was the only factor that was significantly  in fathers of  born without risk factors. Conclusion Authoritative was the most common  , with no significant difference between  in the high-risk and non-high-risk groups. Adopting the appropriate   will optimize developmental outcomes. Further studies are required to look at the influence of proactive positive  practices."
Do dysfunctional coping modes mediate the relationship between perceived parenting style and disordered eating behaviours?,2016,"Background: Preliminary studies suggest that both hood experiences and coping behaviours may be linked to eating disorder symptoms. Methods: In this  maladaptive schema coping modes were investigated as mediators in the relationship between perceived negative  and disordered eating. A total of 174 adults with eating and/or body image concerns completed questionnaires measuring  experiences, schema modes, and disordered eating behaviours. Results: Perfectionistic Overcontroller, Self- Aggrandiser, Compliant Surrenderer, Detached Protector and Detached SelfSoother coping modes partially explained the variance in the relationships between perceived negative  experiences and the behaviours of restricting and compensation (purging and overexercising). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that Overcompensatory, Avoidant and Surrender coping mechanisms all appear to play a role in the maintenance of eating disorder symptoms, and that there are multiple complex relationships between these and Early Maladaptive Schemas that warrant further investigation."
Parenting styles and academic achievement: A cross-cultural study,1998,"The relationships between four   and academic achievement in school  were investigated in Hong Kong, the United States, and Australia. Results indicated that Australian s were lower than both Chinese and American s in academic authoritarianism. Compared to the two English-speaking groups, Chinese s were higher in general authoritarianism, but lower in academic and general authoritativeness. In all three cultures, academic achievement was negatively related to academic authoritarianism, but showed no relationship with academic authoritativeness. Finally, academic achievement was positively related to general authoritarianism in Hong Kong and among  from the United States and Australia whose s did not have any college education. Academic achievement was positively related to general authoritativeness only in the two English-speaking groups."
Parenting and the Socialization of Religiousness and Spirituality,2011,"This  examined   dimensions as moderators of relations between family religiousness and individual religiousness and spirituality. Participants were 122 emerging adults ages 17-31 (M = 20.90, SD = 2.75). Cross-sectional data were obtained through an online survey. Participants rated the frequency with which they engaged in various religious activities with their families when they were younger, the frequency with which they personally do those behaviors currently, their current spirituality, and the   used by their s when they were younger. Family religiousness positively predicted individual religiousness and spirituality. Rejection and autonomy-support moderated the association between family religiousness and individual religiousness, while warmth, rejection, structure, chaos, and autonomy-support moderated the relationship between family religiousness and individual spirituality. Thus, religious beliefs and practices, at whatever level, may be more readily appropriated by the next generation in families characterized by authoritative ."
Authoritarian Parenting and Asian Adolescent School Performance: Insights from the US and Taiwan,2010,"Our  re-examines the relationship between  and school performance among Asian students. We use two sources of data: wave I of the Adolescent Health Longitudinal Survey (Add Health), and waves I and II of the Taiwan Educational Panel Survey (TEPS). Analysis using Add Health reveals that the Asian-American/European-American difference in the -school performance relationship is due largely to differential sample sizes. When we select a random sample of European-American students comparable to the sample size of Asian-American students, authoritarian   shows no effect for European-American students. Furthermore, analysis of TEPS shows that authoritarian  is negatively associated with 's school achievement, while authoritative  is positively associated. This  for Taiwanese Chinese students is similar to previous  for European-American students in the US."
"Parental religiosity, parenting style, and adolescent social responsibility",1999,"The hypotheses that al religiosity would predict authoritative  and adolescent social responsibility were tested using data from fathers, mothers, and adolescents 10 through 18 years of age from 486 mostly Caucasian middle-class families participating in the Nonshared Environment (NSE) Study. Ratings of authoritative and authoritarian  were provided by trained observers using the Family Interaction Global Coding System. Survey instruments included measures of adolescent adjustment used previously by Hetherington and colleagues and a new index of religiosity that assesses the degree to which religious beliefs are manifested in s' daily lives. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that religiosity was associated positively with authoritative  for both s. Mothers' religiosity was associated negatively with authoritarian ; religiosity was unrelated to fathers' authoritarian . Structural equation modeling indicated both direct effects and indirect effects (mediated by authoritative ) of mothers' and fathers' religiosity on adolescent social responsibility."
Sleep problems in  with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: associations with parenting style and sleep hygiene,2017,"We aimed to examine the association between sleep problems and  and sleep hygiene in  with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Participants included 5-13-year-old  with DSM 5 defined ADHD and a -reported moderate-to-severe sleep problem (N = 361). Sleep was assessed using the -reported Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire. s  completed checklists assessing sleep hygiene,  consistency, and  warmth. Linear regression established prediction models controlling for confounding variables including  age and sex, ADHD symptom severity, comorbidities, medication use, and socio-demographic factors. More consistent  was associated with decreased bedtime resistance (beta = -0.16) and decreased sleep anxiety (beta = -0.14), while greater al warmth was associated with increased parasomnias (beta = +0.18) and sleep anxiety (beta = +0.13). Poorer sleep hygiene was associated with increased bedtime resistance (beta = +0.20), increased daytime sleepiness (beta = +0.12), and increased sleep duration problems (beta = +0.13). In conclusion, sleep hygiene and  are important modifiable factors independently associated with sleep problems in  with ADHD. These factors should be considered in the management of sleep problems in  with ADHD."
Parenting and young 's emotional self-regulation in urban Korean families,2018,"The   was designed to examine the relationship of Korean mothers' psychological resources and discipline  to their 's emotional self-regulation development. Structural equation modeling was conducted with a sample of 234 Korean mothers of kindergarten-aged  in the Incheon area in South Korea. The  indicated that maternal harshness negatively predicted and inconsistency positively predicted 's emotional self-regulation development. Second, mothers' psychological resources (i.e.  self-efficacy, enjoyment of ) predicted less harshness, inconsistency, and permissiveness and more responsiveness. Third, the direct path from enjoyment of  to permissiveness in  behaviors was moderated by the 's gender. The  indicated that certain  behaviors, particularly permissiveness and inconsistency, may have culturally distinctive effects on 's development in Korea."
Helicopter Parenting Versus Autonomy Supportive Parenting? A Latent Class Analysis of Parenting Among Emerging Adults and Their Psychological and Relational Well-Being,,"We aim to identify typologies of  among emerging adults and describe how  typologies are related to their life satisfaction, self-efficacy, and - relationship. Using a three-step latent class approach, we analyzed 472 mother- and 426 father- relations. We recruited the students from a private university in Upstate New York. We confirmed four  classes among emerging adult mothers and fathers: helicopter , autonomy supportive , uninvolved , and  that combined characteristics of helicopter  and autonomy supportive . We found that emerging adults whose s were in the autonomy supportive  class reported higher scores on life satisfaction, self-efficacy, and their relationship with their s than those in the helicopter  and uninvolved  classes. In addition, we found that emerging adults in the combined  class reported higher scores for life satisfaction and their relationship with their s than those in the autonomy supportive  class."
Perceived Parental Styles and Adult Separation Anxiety: The Mediating Role of Interpersonal Cognitive Distortions,2017,"Objective: This  primarily aimed to determine whether perceived al  and interpersonal cognitive distortions are predictors of adult separation anxiety. Further, this  aimed to examine the mediating role of interpersonal cognitive distortions in the relationship between perceived over-permissive/boundless al  and adult separation anxiety in university students. Method: This  included 444 university students (281 female (63,3%) and 163 male (36,7%) with a mean age of sample 21,02 years (SS = 1,70). The Demographic Information Form, Young  Inventory, Interpersonal Cognitive Distortions Scale, and Adult Separation Anxiety Questionnaire were used. Results: The regression analyses revealed that the age of the participants and their percieved controlling/shaping father   negatively predicted adult separation anxiety, while percieved overpermissive/boundless mother  , exploitative/abusive and overprotective/anxious father   and the subscales of the interpersonal cognitive distortions scale positively predicted adult separation anxiety. As hypothesized, data from this  reveal that subscales of the interpersonal cognitive distortions scale play a full mediating role in the relationship between over-permissive/boundless   and adult separation anxiety. Conclusion: Results indicate that the perceived over-permissive/boundless   positively predicts adult separation anxiety symptoms by distorting interpersonal cognitions. Furthermore, the over-permissive   and lack of boundaries and/or discipline lead to similar adverse effects as do authoritarian and normative . To our knowledge, there are very few studies investigating adult separation anxiety symptoms in Turkey. Therefore, our current  provides practical information to mental health professionals regarding adult separation anxiety symptoms, which are likely to be accompanied by other psychological symptoms."
"Perceptions of Vietnamese Fathers' Acculturation Levels, Parenting Styles, and Mental Health Outcomes in Vietnamese American Adolescent Immigrants",2008,"Vietnamese adult and adolescent immigrants in the United States acculturate to the Western culture at different rates. Most Vietnamese s tend to use the authoritarian  method in which dictatorial approaches are enforced, possibly leading to family conflicts and mental health issues. By means of the Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identity Acculturation Scale, the al Authority Questionnaire, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Inventory, this exploratory  surveyed 290 Vietnamese American adolescents in a major metropolitan area to examine the relationship between their fathers' acculturation levels and   and the relationships among   and self-esteem levels and depression scores of the adolescents. Findings revealed that most of the adolescents perceived that their fathers have not acculturated to the U.S. culture and continue to practice the traditional authoritarian  , regardless of the amount of time spent in the United States. Furthermore,  indicate that adolescents who perceived their fathers as using the authoritarian   reported lower levels of self-esteem and higher depression scores when compared with those who perceived their fathers as using the authoritative  ."
Parenting and Sibling Relationships in Family with Disruptive Behavior Disorders. Are Non-Clinical Siblings More Vulnerable for Emotional and Behavioral Problems?,2021,"Disruptive Behavior Disorders (DBD) are the most common mental health disorders in the school-aged  population. Although harsh  is a key risk factor in the shaping of DBD, studies neglect the presence of siblings and differential . This  aims to compare: (1)   and sibling relationship in sibling dyads of clinical families, composed of a DBD  and a non-clinical sibling, with control families composed of two non-clinical siblings; (2)  , sibling relationship, and emotional and behavioral problems in DBD , non-clinical sibling, and non-clinical  of control group. Sixty-one families (composed of mother and sibling dyads), divided into clinical (n = 27) and control (n = 34) groups, completed the APQ, SRI, and CBCL questionnaires. Results indicated differential  in clinical families, compared to control group families, with higher negative  toward the DBD  than the sibling; no difference emerged in sibling relationship within sibling dyads (clinical vs. control). Finally, externalizing and internalizing problems were higher in DBD  and their siblings, compared to control, indicating DBD sibling psychopathology vulnerability. Findings suggest inclusion of siblings in the clinical assessment and rehabilitative intervention of DBD , given that the promotion of positive  could improve mental health in the offspring."
Linking implementation of evidence-based parenting programs to outcomes in early intervention,2017,"In the field of early intervention, only a few studies of  interventions include both participant and facilitator behaviors. Fidelity and supervision (facilitator characteristics) and dosage and satisfaction (participant characteristics) were tested on the outcome of improved   in a sample of 36 s of young  with disabilities. Results indicated that the facilitator behavior of fidelity was significantly and negatively related to the program outcome of  ; no effect was found for the facilitator behavior of supervision. For the participant behaviors, both dosage and satisfaction had non-significant relationships with the program outcome of   at follow-up. The surprising negative relationship between content fidelity and   was discussed. Two possible explanations were: (1) process or quality of intervention delivery is more influential than content fidelity, which considers only adherence to the intervention manual, and (2) the developmental stage of early intervention families calls for more focus on relationships between facilitators and s and less on content of the specific intervention."
Childcare support and  social development in Japan: investigating the mediating role of parental psychological condition and parenting style,2021,"In humans, support from partners and allos is crucial for successful -rearing and optimal  development. However, the complex relationships among care support, 's outcomes and al characteristics have not been fully examined. We investigate how three sources of partner and alloal support-partner's care participation, support from 's grands and support from non-kin-can be associated with  social development. We hypothesize that the associations between care support from partners/allos and  social development are partly mediated by al psychological condition and  . To test this, we conducted path analyses on online survey data collected in 2016 from s of 3- to 5-year-old  in Japan. We found no evidence that care support had direct positive effects on  social development. Rather, the benefit of care support was mediated by its effects on al psychological condition and  , which in turn improved 's outcomes. At the same time, we found some evidence that greater availability of care support was directly associated with more behavioural difficulties in . Our findings reveal the complex pathways between care support, al characteristics and 's outcomes in Japan, showing potential mechanisms behind al and alloal effects in industrialized populations. This article is part of the theme issue 'Multidisciplinary perspectives on social support and maternal- health'."
Parenting styles and personal variables as risk factors of aggressive behavior,2003,"The purpose of this paper is to analyze personality and family variables related to adolescent aggressiveness, emphasis being placed on emotional processes linked to a lack of control or emotional regulation and -rearing  perceived in their s by adolescents. An empirical analysis was carried out including 1,285 randomly selected youngsters (aged 13 to 18, 698 males and 597 females). The discriminating analyses conducted show that emotional processes reach higher correlation with aggressive behavior, emotional instability and proneness to anger being the main predicting factors of aggressiveness. The s' -rearing  have a secondary position in drawing the differential profile between high and low aggressiveness individuals, particularly male ones."
The Predictive Role of Maternal Parenting and Stress on Pupils' Bullying involvement,2019,"The link between inappropriate   and both bullying and victimization is well documented. However, it is not clear as to which kind of   is associated with victimization. Furthermore, no studies have yet been conducted regarding the role of al stress in bullying and victimization. This  aimed to examine the role of   and maternal stress in pupils' bullying and victimization. A total of 300 primary school pupils, enrolled in fourth and fifth grades, participated in the . Initially, 100 noninvolved pupils were randomly selected using a multistage cluster sampling method. Then using a screening method, 100 bully pupils and 100 victimized peers were selected. Olweus Bullying Scale and teacher nomination were administered for screening these pupils. Baumrind  Style Questionnaire and revised version of Abidin al Stress Index (short form) were  applied to all pupils in the . Data were analyzed using discriminant function analysis. The findings showed that (a) with regard to  , significant differences were found among groups. Authoritarian   could significantly predict pupils' bullying behavior, whereas victimization was predictable in families with permissive  . In addition, noninvolved pupils were predicted to have authoritative  . (b) Considering maternal stress, significant differences were observed across groups. s of bullies and victims were predicted to have higher maternal stress than noninvolved pupils. The implications of the  in relation to the role of mothers in bullying and victimization are discussed."
Parenting styles and Turkish 's emotion regulation: The mediating role of parent-teacher relationships,2021,"The current  examined the contributions of   (inductive reasoning and punishment) and -teacher relationships to Turkish preschool 's emotion regulation, with a specific focus on the mediating role of -teacher relationship between   and 's emotion regulation. A total of 140 preschoolers (59 girls), their s and teachers were recruited for the current . Children's age ranged from 39 to 77 months (M = 62.56, SD = 8.52). All teachers (n = 10) were female and working at a state-funded school. Mothers reported on their   and teachers reported on -teacher relationship and 's emotion regulation. Results from regression analysis showed that s' inductive reasoning was positively associated with 's emotion regulation and -teacher relationship. Higher -teacher relationship was positively associated with higher levels of 's emotion regulation. In addition, -teacher relationship mediated the association between inductive  and emotion regulation of . Limitations and future directions of the current  are discussed."
Is parenting style a predictor of suicide attempts in a representative sample of adolescents?,2014,"Background: Suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are serious but not rare conditions in adolescents. However, there are several  and practical suicide-prevention initiatives that discuss the possibility of preventing serious self-harm. Profound knowledge about risk and protective factors is therefore necessary. The aim of this  is a) to clarify the role of  behavior and   in adolescents' suicide attempts and b) to identify other statistically significant and clinically relevant risk and protective factors for suicide attempts in a reative sample of German adolescents. Methods: In the years 2007/2008, a reative written survey of N = 44,610 students in the 9th grade of different school types in Germany was conducted. In this survey, the lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts was investigated as well as potential predictors including  behavior. A three-step statistical analysis was carried out: I) As basic model, the association between  and suicide attempts was explored via binary logistic regression controlled for age and sex. II) The predictive values of 13 additional potential risk/protective factors were analyzed with single binary logistic regression analyses for each predictor alone. Non-significant predictors were excluded in Step III. III) In a multivariate binary logistic regression analysis, all significant predictor variables from Step II and the   were included after testing for multicollinearity. Results: Three al variables showed a relevant association with suicide attempts in adolescents - (all protective): mother's warmth and father's warmth in hood and mother's control in adolescence (Step I). In the full model (Step III), Authoritative  (protective: OR: .79) and Rejecting-Neglecting  (risk: OR: 1.63) were identified as significant predictors (p < .001) for suicidal attempts. Seven further variables were interpreted to be statistically significant and clinically relevant: ADHD, female sex, smoking, Binge Drinking, absenteeism/truancy, migration background, and al separation events. Conclusions:   does matter. While  of Authoritative s profit,  of Rejecting-Neglecting s are put at risk - as we were able to show for suicide attempts in adolescence. Some of the identified risk factors contribute new knowledge and potential areas of intervention for special groups such as migrants or  diagnosed with ADHD."
Positive Parenting Mitigates the Effects of Poor Self-Regulation on Body Mass Index Trajectories From Ages 4-15 Years,2014,"Objective: This  sought to determine whether   moderates the effects of delay of gratification on body mass index (BMI) trajectories from ages 4-15 years. Method: Longitudinal data were analyzed for 778  drawn from the Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development.   (i.e., authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and neglectful) was created from measures of mothers' sensitivity and expectations for self-control when  were age 4 years. Self-regulation was  measured at 4 years using a well-known delay of gratification protocol. BMI was calculated from measured height and weight at each time point. Mixed modeling was used to test the interaction of   and ability to delay gratification on BMI trajectories from 4-15 years. Results: There was a significant interaction effect of  and ability to delay on BMI growth from 4-15 years for boys. Boys who had authoritarian mothers and failed to delay gratification had a significantly steeper rate of growth in BMI from hood through adolescence than  in any other  by delay group. Conclusion: Authoritative and permissive   were protective against more rapid BMI gains for boys who could not delay gratification. Ability to delay gratification was protective against BMI gains for boys who had s with authoritarian or neglectful  ."
Maternal and paternal parenting styles associated with relational aggression in  and adolescents: A conceptual analysis and meta-analytic review,2011,"How does  affect relational aggression in ? The goal of the  series of meta-analyses based on 48 studies (28,097 ) was to analyze and integrate the findings on the associations between various types of  behaviors and relational aggression, and to identify potential substantive and methodological factors that may moderate these associations. To distinguish between different  strategies, experts sorted the  measures used in the studies into 10 groups. Results of a multiple correspondence analysis revealed four separate clusters: Positive , psychologically controlling , negative/harsh , and uninvolved . The meta-analyses demonstrated that more positive  was associated with less relational aggression (combined effect sizes r = -.06, p < .05, for mothers, r = -.08, p < .01, for fathers). More harsh  (combined effect sizes r = .11, p < .01, for mothers, r = .12, p < .01, for fathers) and more uninvolved  (combined effect sizes r = .07, p < .01, for mothers, absent for fathers) were associated with increased relational aggression. Paternal psychologically controlling  was positively related to relational aggression (r = .05, p < .01), whereas maternal psychologically controlling  was not (combined effect sizes r = .04, p = .09). The effect of several moderators is discussed. The findings of this  suggest that dimensions of positive and negative  behaviors of mothers and fathers are associated with 's relational aggression and that these associations are - in case of fathers - contingent upon a number of sampling and procedural characteristics.

Maternal and paternal similarities and differences in parenting: An examination of Mexican-American parents of young ,2007,"The   evaluated the degree of al similarity-dissimilarity across  dimensions operationalized in terms of: (1) one's own and one's partner's ; (2) meta-emotion belief structures; (3) behavioral strategies in reaction to 's emotions; as well as (4) al support and responsiveness. The first four dimensions were assessed with independent self-reports from both mothers and fathers and the latter was measured through observed behaviors in a discussion of emotions. Fifty-seven families participated. The mothers (92%) and fathers (90%) of preschool-aged  (mean age 57.5 months, 54% male) were predominantly of Mexican descent. Results revealed significant similarity when comparing mothers' and fathers' observed behaviors. Agreement among s  emerged when comparing minimizing coping reactions to 's emotional displays and self-reported and reports of one's partner's authoritative . Despite evidence of agreement on use of authoritative strategies and similarity on observed behaviors, comparisons of mean levels revealed dissimilarity. The participating mothers reported a greater tendency to employ authoritative strategies and their partners' ratings of the mothers'  confirmed this perceived difference. In addition, comparisons of mothers' and fathers' observed behaviors in interaction with their  suggested that, while mothers and fathers are engaged in similar behaviors, mothers are observed to engage in them more frequently. These  reinforce the need to assess both s, employing multiple methods, in determining interdependence or their combined and unique contributions to socializing . (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

What's past is prologue: Recalled parenting styles are associated with hood cancer survivors' mental health outcomes more than 25 years after diagnosis,2020,"Background: With the increased survival rates of hood cancer, long-term survivors' well-being over the life span has come into focus. A better understanding of the determinants of hood cancer survivors' (CCS) mental health outcomes contributes to the identification of vulnerable individuals as well as to the development of evidence-based prevention and intervention efforts. It has been noted that psychosocial factors such as al rearing behavior shape individual differences in mental health. There is  evidence that s show altered  behavior in the face of hood cancer, e. g. that they express more emotional support, but  more worries. However, little is known about the relevance of different   for CCS' mental health decades after diagnosis and treatment. Methods: We examined the associations of recalled   and disease-related factors with lifetime diagnoses of depression and anxiety disorders in a German, registry-based sample of adult CCS (N = 948, 44.50% women) with survival times > 25 years. We conducted logistic regression analyses of lifetime diagnoses of depression and anxiety disorders, respectively, on dimensions of recalled al rearing behavior (measured with a validated German short version of the EMBU) controlling for relevant adjustment variables such as the presence of physical illnesses. Results: Recalled   of both s had statistically relevant associations with CCS' lifetime depression and anxiety diagnoses. Maternal emotional warmth was related to fewer lifetime diagnoses of depression and fewer lifetime diagnoses of anxiety. Memories of paternal control and overprotection were positively associated with lifetime diagnoses of anxiety. Conclusion: The  indicate that mental reations of one's caregivers are associated with psychological long-term outcomes. Thus, medical professionals should involve the s and support them in accompanying their  through the difficult times of treatment and survivorship. Interventions aimed at fostering survivors' quality of life should consider the sustained relevance of early relationships."
When and why parents prompt their  to apologize: the roles of transgression type and parenting style,2017,"Young  are sensitive to the importance of apologies, yet little is known about when and why s prompt apologies from . We examined these issues with s of 3-to-10 year-old  (N=483). s judged it to be important for  to apologize following both intentional and accidental morally-relevant transgressions, and they anticipated prompting apologies in both contexts, showing an outcome bias' (i.e., a concern for the outcomes of 's transgressions rather than for their underlying intentions). s viewed apologies as less important after 's breaches of social convention; s recognized differences between social domains in their responses to 's transgressions. Irrespective of  , s were influenced in similar fashion by particular combinations of transgressions and victims, though permissive s were least likely to anticipate prompting apologies. s endorsed different reasons for prompting apologies as a function of transgression type, suggesting that they attend to key features of their 's transgressions when deciding when to prompt apologies."
Measurement and Identification of Parenting Behaviors Associated with Social-Emotional Outcomes in Children: The Racial and Cultural Appropriateness of a Commonly Used Parenting Measure,2021,"Objective: The objective of this  was to examine   (observed - interactions via the Two-Bag Task) associated with young 's socioemotional outcomes, comparing  from Mexican-American and African American families with  from their White counterparts. Methods: The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Birth Cohort data were used to examine 6 global   with socioemotional outcomes at 48 months of age while controlling for both time-independent and time-depending sociodemographic, maternal mental health, and  characteristics. Data were stratified by race and ethnicity, and weighted longitudinal linear regressions models were estimated using STATA/Xtmixed. Results: The 6 global  scores from the Two-Bag Task measures differed across White, African American, and Mexican-American groups of s. White s on average scored higher on   related to sensitivity, positive regard, and cognitive stimulation, whereas Mexican-American and African American s scored lower. These   were associated with both approach to learning and social competence outcomes among White  but were nearly nonexistent for Mexican-American and African American  when adjusting for covariates. Conclusion: Our  highlight the need to critically evaluate measures of  behaviors used in  studies with racially and ethnically diverse families. Examining the comprehensive psychometric properties and cultural appropriateness of  measures for diverse families is important to optimally support  development for non-White . Furthermore, a critical lens is important to mitigate the perpetuation of inaccurate  findings for Mexican-American and African American ."
Do parents of  with metabolic diseases benefit from the Triple P - Positive Parenting Program? A pilot study,2018,"Background: s of  with metabolic diseases report more  stress, anxiety, depression and dysfunctional   than s of  without metabolic diseases. In addition, their  have more behavioral problems. Beside the fact that metabolic diseases are rare, they form a relatively large proportion in the morbidity and mortality of chronically ill . Methods: In this pilot  14 s of  with metabolic diseases, aged between 2.5 and 13 years, participated in a quasi-experimental pre-post-follow-up . Results: After participating in the Level 4 Group Triple P-program there were small effects in decreasing  behavioral problems and large effects in decreasing dysfunctional  . There was a moderate to large reduction of al stress and a large reduction of al anxiety. Only the effects on the behavioral problems and the   'laxness' were no longer significant at 6 months follow-up. Conclusions: In summary it can be said that the existing Triple P-program has good effects, with a great degree of satisfaction, for s of  with metabolic diseases in reducing dysfunctional  ,  stress and behavioral problems of their . One should not wait for a specialized program to reach these s, but further  is necessary as a greater effect can be expected when this program is adapted to these s."
Parenting and  body mass index: Longitudinal investigation of maternal and paternal influence,2011,"The aim of this  was to investigate the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between general  and body mass index (BMI) status of  between the ages of 4 and 7 in Australia. A nationally reative sample of 4,423  (49% female) and their s was used for the  . Measures of al demandingness and responsiveness were completed by s at  age 45 years. Height and weight measurements of  were taken at  age 45, and again at 67, from which BMI status was calculated. No influence of mothers'  on  BMI status was shown, and fathers' responsiveness was found to be predictive of increased risk for overweight/obesity at 67 years. While the   is complicated by measurement issues, findings suggest that increased risk for overweight in young  may be associated with responsiveness in fathers. Obesity prevention programs involving s should take into account the influence of fathers'  on  BMI status."
Positive parenting among African American mothers with a serious mental illness,2002,"Positive  is hampered by social-contextual risks-lack of income, education, and support, as well as maternal mental illness-but current models do not examine the effect of each factor in concert with the others. Using structural equation modeling and a community sample (N = 202) of African American mothers diagnosed with depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia, we examined the direct and indirect effects of poverty, maternal education, social support, material and social stress, current mental health, and psychiatric history on positive  attitudes, involvement in 's education, and authoritative  . The strongest predictors of  attitudes were stress and current mental health.  attitudes were the strongest predictors of  involvement and  but stress and current mental health were  predictive. Involvement was  predicted by maternal education and social support."
Profiles of Parenting Behaviors: Associations with Adolescents' Problematic Outcomes,2021,"Research has consistently found evidence for four   that vary along the dimensions of warmth/responsiveness and control/demandingness. Although these   have important implications for youth development, less  has explored how s of adolescents vary in their use of subtypes of warmth and control, as well as negative aspects of . The current  utilized a person-centered approach to examine adolescents' report of their s' engagement in six behaviors (i.e., rules, solicitation, psychological control, problem communication, open communication, warmth). Additionally, the current  examined whether profiles of perceived  behaviors are differentially associated with adolescents' substance use, risky cyber behaviors, over-eating behaviors, under-eating behaviors, and depressive symptoms. Data were collected from 161 adolescents in the US (M-age = 14.42, SD = 1.73, range = 12-18; 80.7% Caucasian; 59.6% female) who completed questionnaires regarding  behaviors and problematic outcomes. Latent profile analyses indicated that adolescents perceived their s as displaying five unique profiles of  behaviors (i.e., Problematic, Controlling, Inconsistent, Warm and Open, Authoritative), which were uniquely associated with adolescents' problematic outcomes. Findings urge ers to consider how multiple aspects of al warmth/responsiveness and control/demandingness along with negative  behaviors co-occur among s of adolescents and differentially relate to developmental outcomes. When examining adolescents' perceived  profiles using a wider range of  behaviors, findings suggest that   are more nuanced than previous  has suggested. Further, these nuanced profiles have important implications for adolescents' problematic outcomes."
The transaction between parents' perceptions of their 's shyness and their parenting styles,1999,"In recent years, ers have examined factors that determine  beliefs, , and behaviours. One potential determinant of  is the  him/herself. Child characteristics, such as temperament, have been cited as evocative influences on  beliefs and behaviours. The primary purpose of this  was to investigate the longitudinal relations between 's social wariness/inhibition and s' beliefs about how to best socialise their . Questionnaire data on  temperament and  practices were collected from the s (mothers and fathers) of sixty 2-year-olds; identical data were collected 2 years later. Observations of inhibited behaviour were taken at two years. Results indicated that few differences existed between mothers' and fathers' expressed   at ages 2 and 4 years. Second, al perceptions of  shyness at age 2 were: (a) stable to age 4; and (b) predicted a lack of encouragement of independence at age 4. Third, s' expressed lack of encouragement of independence, although stable from 2 to 4 years, failed to predict  shyness at age 4. The findings support the conjecture that young 's dispositional characteristics predict subsequent maternal and paternal behaviour."
Parenting styles and attachment in school-aged  who stutter,2012,"al input has been described as influential in early hood stuttering yet the exact nature of this influence remains equivocal. The   aimed to examine whether quantitative measures of  ,  and peer attachment patterns, and - and self-reported  behaviour could differentiate between school-aged  who stutter (CWS) (n = 10) and their fluent peers (n = 10). In addition, qualitative individual semi-structured interviews with all CWS were conducted to gain insight into their life experiences and reflections in relation to stuttering. The interviews were classified into ancillary themes of school, peers and s. Quantitative findings revealed that CWS perceived their s with significantly lower attachment, particularly in relation to trust, and s of CWS perceived their  with significantly higher maladjustments than fluent counterparts. Qualitative themes emerged pertaining to attitudes, perceptions and relationships with teachers, peers and s, with consistent experiences of teasing and bullying reported as a consequence of the stutter. The majority of participants recounted frustration with the nature in which their s attempted to remediate their stuttering. Collectively, these findings highlight imperative management considerations for school-aged CWS and their s. The usefulness of quantitative and qualitative  paradigms is  emphasised. Learning outcomes: The reader will be able to: (1) identify themes associated with the impact a hood stutter has on  and peer relationships; (2) identify how the quality of the   relationship is influenced by   and attachment; and (3) discuss the clinical implications of the  for  who stutter and their families.

Parenting Style and Peer Trust in Relation to School Adjustment in Middle Childhood,2016,"Fourth grade  (N = 346) reported on their perceptions of their mothers' acceptance and behavioral control, their own feelings of trust of their friends, and their experiences of stress within the school environment. School record data yielded four indicators of academic achievement: math and reading grades and performance on state- wide standardized tests of math and reading. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the fit of a model linking  and peer constructs to school adjustment. The best fitting model indicated that higher levels of maternal acceptance, but not behavioral control, were associated with both lower levels of school stress and higher academic achievement. The association between acceptance and school stress, but not academic achievement, was partially mediated by levels of peer trust."
Parenting Practices Scale: Its Validity and Reliability for Parents of School-Aged Children,2017," practices are a field in psychology in which numerous studies have been carried out. In western countries, attempts to define the concept operationally have led to the emergence of many scales claiming to test the concept. This  aims at developing a scale to evaluate the  practices of s with school and at carrying out the validity and reliability tests of the scale in question. In the , 511 s with school between the ages of 6-13 participated. The initial scale consisted of 84 items. Explanatory factor analysis was applied in order to analyze the construct validity and factor structure of the scale, whereas principle component analysis and the varimax rotation technique were used as the factoring technique. Following analysis, 32 items were removed from the scale. The final version of the scale consists of six components (sub-dimensions) and 52 items that explain 40.1% of the variance. Afterwards, second-order confirmatory factor analysis was applied, and model data fit was observed to be high. Cronbach alpha values of the scales' sub-dimensions were found to be between .65 and .79. Criterion validity of the scale was  tested during the . To this end, the  Practices Scale (PPS) and al Acceptance-Rejection Questionnaire (PARQ) were used. The correlation between sub-dimensions and total score was analyzed in the , in which 168 s participated in total. The findings support the criterion validity of the scale. Moreover, the  prove that the developed scale has the ability to validly test existing differences among s'  practices and the psychological structures leading to them."
How are parenting practices associated with bullying in adolescents? A cross-sectional study,,"Background   have been previously associated with bullying, but some  practices have not received strong attention in the literature. We aimed to assess how  practices are associated with cyberbullying and traditional bullying involvement in adolescents. Method A cross-sectional survey of 2,218 secondary-school students in London (UK) was conducted. The Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire and the Alabama  Questionnaire (APQ- form) were used. Results Positive  significantly protected against cyberbullying involvement but not against traditional bullying. Inconsistent discipline was associated with being a cyberbully but not being a traditional one. Lower levels of monitoring were associated with being a cyberbully, a cyberbully-victim, a traditional bully, or a traditional bully-victim. Conclusions  practices seem to be more relevant in cyberbullying than traditional bullying. Effective  practices such as positive  deserve attention as a potentially modifiable factor to protect against cyberbullying involvement. Ineffective  practices such as inconsistent discipline are relevant in cyberaggression, whereas poor monitoring is associated with both cyberbullying and traditional bullying. Clinical and  implications are discussed."
Parenting styles as a predictor of long-term psychosocial outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in early hood,2020,"Objective: This  sought to determine whether   predict long-term psychosocial outcomes after traumatic brain injury in young . Methods: The  involved a concurrent cohort, prospective design, with longitudinal assessments up to early adolescence. Participants included 126  with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury or orthopedic injury, ages 3 to 6 years 11 months, recruited between 2003 and 2006. s rated 's pre-injury behavioral adjustment, social competence, and executive functioning shortly after injury, and again 6.8 years post injury. s  rated their   (permissive, authoritarian, authoritative) at both occasions. Results: After controlling for pre-injury functioning, the groups differed significantly on all three outcomes (Delta R-2 0.07 to 0.13). Late but not early   predicted outcomes in all groups (Delta R-2 0.06 to 0.17): more permissive  predicted worse outcomes in all domains (beta= -0.18, 0.20, 0.27); and more authoritative  predicted better social competence and executive functioning (beta= -0.17, 0.46). Severe traumatic brain injury interacted with   for several outcomes, with ineffective  exacerbating the negative sequelae. Conclusions:   predicts 's long-term psychosocial functioning after early hood injury, and may moderate the effects of early traumatic brain injury."
Parenting and Adolescents' Sexual Development in Western Societies A Literature Review,2011,"This review examines associations between   and the psychosexual development of adolescents. Methods and  of empirical studies of associations between al support, control, and knowledge and the sexual behavior and sexual health of adolescents are described and evaluated. The  show that, in general, higher scores on support, control, and knowledge relate to a delay of first sexual intercourse, safer sexual practices, and higher sexual competence. Despite the vast amount of literature on this subject, the majority of these studies focus on single dimensions of  and unidirectional  influences. This review generates hypotheses regarding interactions of different   and reciprocal associations between s and their .

The Early Parenting Attitudes Questionnaire: Measuring Intuitive Theories of Parenting and Child Development,2020," behaviors and decisions play an important role in determining 's early environment. Are these behaviors driven by an intuitive theory of  - a coherent set of beliefs about  development and - relationships? In exploratory work, we asked adults on Amazon Mechanical Turk to endorse a set of propositions about  and conducted exploratory factor analyses of their responses. Three distinct factors appeared in responses: an Affection and Attachment factor, an Early Learning factor, and a Rules and Respect factor. In an iterative process, we created a scale of items with subscales designed to measure these factors, which we call the Early  Attitudes Questionnaire (EPAQ). We next conducted two studies with groups of s (on Mechanical Turk and from the membership of a local museum) to estimate the validity of the new scale. We asked whether agreement with each subscale varied based on demographic factors and whether intuitive theories predicted self-reported  behaviors. The EPAQ provides an instrument to assess attitudes about  and  development, facilitating investigation of and intervention on  behaviors."
Influence of parenting styles on the adjustment and academic achievement of traditional college freshmen,2000,"Using self-report questionnaire data, the al Authority Questionnaire, Quick Word Test, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Inventory, and family demographics (i.e., family structure and al education) were administered to 101 college freshmen. Researchers examined the relationship between   and (a) academic achievement and (b) adjustment of traditional college freshmen. Multiple regression models demonstrated that authoritative   was positively related to student's academic adjustment. Moreover Self-esteem was significantly predictive of social, personal-emotional, goal commitment-institutional, academic, and overall adjustment of traditional college freshmen. Implications are drawn for s as well as educational institutions."
The Differential Effects of Parental Style on Parental Legitimacy and Domain Specific Adolescent Rule-Violating Behaviors,2021,"This  examined whether al legitimacy served as a mediator in the relation between   (authoritative, authoritarian, permissive) and adolescent engagement in four domain-specific rule-violating behaviors (RVB: relational aggression, assault, theft, substance use). A total of 708 middle school and high school students from the New Hampshire Youth Study were surveyed four times every six months for the current . Using generalized structural equation modeling,  demonstrated that al legitimacy was a mediator of authoritative  , but was not a significant or consistent mediator for authoritarian and permissive  , with RVBs. al legitimacy fully mediated the relation between authoritative  and assault, theft, and relational aggression, but only partially mediated the relation with substance use. This finding suggests that al legitimacy might be more important in certain domains of behavior than others. Moveover, this pattern mostly persisted when examining changes in RVB overtime and changes in al legitimacy as a mediator. The implications of al authority and why adolescents may engage in certain RVB over others, as well as how developmental factors are accounted for in legal socialization, are discussed."
"Co-parenting in a Highly Conflicted Separation/Divorce: Learning about Parents and their Experiences of Parenting Coordination, Legal, and Mental Health Interventions",2016,"Sixty high-conflict separated/divorced co-s completed surveys investigating characteristics and dynamics (narcissism, empathy, conflict) that were examined in relation to co-  and s' experiences of  coordination, legal, and mental health interventions. Study findings for this sample did not support common notions found in the literatures on  coordination and high-conflict divorce that suggest these s are often narcissistic or low in empathy. Findings pertaining to all high-conflict participant experiences revealed the presence of common elements across aspects of practitioners and interventions with which they were both satisfied and dissatisfied."

Do these interactions correlate, in any way, with the way the personality traits that their  develop, when they grow up, is the question that has been tried to answer in this . Methodology: The  was conducted on 100 MBBS students of the 4th year of MMMC and H Kumarhatti, Solan, Himachal Pradesh, India. Two self-administered questionnaires were administered to the students: (1) International Personality Disorder Examination (IPDE)- ICD 10 was used to screen for the personality traits of students and (2) the Perceptions of s Scale to assess the students' retrospective perception of their s' methods of . Result: MAS and FAS were found to be significantly negatively correlated with paranoid trait among students;MW was significantly negatively correlated with paranoid trait among students; and FI,FASand FW were significantly negatively correlated with borderline trait, and FI was significantly negatively correlated with dependant traits.

Modern' parenting and the uses of care advice in post-war England,2018,"In the post-war English media, modern'  referred to psychologically inspired  of  drawn from professionals. Drawing on archived social-science interviews with over 600 families, this article considers what modern'  meant in the vernacular. It explores the emergence of a group of working-class s who felt modern' because they had adopted whichever  of  they felt right' for their , whatever its source. These s personalized modern' ideas found in the mass media, using them to justify choices which they had already made. They came to identify as flexible, adaptive, s, rather than as people who unquestioningly implemented someone else's ideas. Using reflexive models of selfhood, they produced a syncretic amalgamation of ideas about , which were drawn, simultaneously, from care professionals, members of their communities and their own intuitions. This allowed them to fashion unique  of , tailored to their . Rethinking what was modern' and traditional' let them reconceive  as a personal matter, not as something which professionals or kin should dictate. The post-war fixation on the self was therefore consonant with the reworking' of class, rather than with its declining salience in English society."
"A matter of style? Parenting behaviors of mothers of typically-developing ,  with mild intellectual disability, and deaf or hard-of-hearing ",,"Are there categorically distinct  behaviours that differ between families with  with and without disabilities (mild intellectual disability [MID], deaf or hard of hearing  [DHH])? A  involving 719  and their families assessed mothers' responses to the  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire and 's language skills at 8 and 9 years. A latent class analysis revealed three discrete classes of  behaviours: (1) authoritative, (2) mildly authoritative, and (3) inconsistent or neglecting. The latter class comprised around 10% of the mothers, across all groups. The behaviours that were associated with this class, however, differed across groups: In families with  without disability, it was characterized by inconsistent (authoritarian and permissive) behaviours; in families with  with disabilities, it is best described as neglecting. A high level of education was related to better  behaviours, and in  with DHH, neglecting  was associated with poor language development."
Relationship between maternal parenting styles and African American and white adolescents' interpersonal relationships,1996,"One hundred and fifty adolescents, ages 13 through 19 years, were administered the al Authority Questionnaire (PAQ) and the Assessment of Interpersonal Relations (AIR) in a counterbalanced order to examine the relationship between perceived maternal   and adolescents' interpersonal relations with their mothers, male peers, female peers and teachers.   were categorized according to three al prototypes identified by Baumrind (1971), permissive, authoritarian and authoritative. Students who described their mothers as authoritative reported better interpersonal relations than adolescents with authoritarian or permissive mothers. No significant gender differences were found on any of the measures; however, a significant race by relationship type interaction was found. African American students reported more positive relationships with their mothers than did White students; White students reported more positive relationships with their peers and with their teachers than did African American students."
Food parenting practices and  dietary behavior. Prospective relations and the moderating role of general parenting,2014,"Research on  practices has focused on individual behaviors while largely failing to consider the context of their use, i.e., general . We examined the extent to which food  practices predict 's dietary behavior (classified as unhealthy: snacking, sugar-sweetened beverage; and healthy: water and fruit intake). Furthermore, we tested the moderating role of general  on this relationship. Within the KOALA Birth Cohort Study, in the Netherlands, questionnaire data were collected at 6 and 8 years (N = 1654). Correlations were computed to assess the association between food  practices and general  (i.e., nurturance, behavioral control, structure, coercive control, and overprotection). Linear regression models were fitted to assess whether food  practices predict dietary behavior. Instrumental and emotional feeding, and pressure to eat were found to have associations with undesirable  dietary behavior (increased unhealthy intake/decreased healthy intake), whereas associations were in the desirable direction for covert control, encouragement and restriction. Moderation analyses were performed by evaluating interactions with general . The associations of encouragement and covert control with desirable  dietary behaviors were found to be stronger for  who were reared in a positive  context. Future  should assess the influence of contextual  factors moderating the relationships between food  and  dietary behavior as the basis for the development of more effective family-based interventions.

Parenting as a dynamic process: A test of the resource dilution hypothesis,2008,"In this paper, we tested the resource dilution hypothesis, which posits that, because  resources are finite, the addition of a new sibling depletes  resources for other  in the household. We estimated growth curve models on the self-reported  practices of mothers using four waves of data collected biennially between 1994 and 2000 on a nationally reative sample of 2,082 Canadian  aged 2 to 5 at initial interview and in continuously intact, two-biological- households. Results showed that when new  were added to the household, mothers exhibited declines in positive interaction, but increased their levels of consistent . Taken together, these findings suggested that  resources were reallocated, rather than diluted, when family size increased."
South Korean mothers' parenting experiences in divorced mother-headed families,2017,"These multiple case studies show what in divorced mother-headed families of South Korea, mothers experience with regard to  their  aged 6 to 12 years. Data were collected from participant observations and semi-structured interviews with the participants, including mothers and their  in four divorced mother-headed families in South Korea, for a span of 11 months. Each case shows how divorced mothers'  experiences are mobilized through their financial status and post-divorce co patterns. The findings of this  are as follows. First, the mothers' relationships with their  were formed by their current relationships with the ex-spouse. Secondly, mothers showed low expectations of 's academic achievement and future career. Thirdly, mothers had ambivalent feelings towards their  due to financial difficulties and cumulative stress with the added strain of single . Financial stability as well as cooperative  with ex-spouses after divorce helped lighten the mothers' burdens of raising  in a divorced family and thereby reduced psychological vulnerability. Fourthly, mothers' different communication  differently played out in their relationships with , which further affected interactive occasions in 's in-home experiences."
Distinguishing between poor/dysfunctional parenting and  emotional maltreatment,2011,"Objective: This paper was intended to distinguish between poor  and  emotional maltreatment (CEM), to inform  welfare and public health policymakers of the need for differentiated responses. Methods: Scientific literature was integrated with current practice and assumptions relating to poor/dysfunctional  and  emotional maltreatment, with a primary focus on the - relationship context (rather than abnormal  behavior alone). Numerous factors that impinge on the distinction between these acts were considered, such as the 's age, the frequency, and severity of behavior shown by caregivers, cultural norms, and al beliefs and goals in rearing. Results: The literature on  emotional maltreatment has advanced beyond the descriptive phase of scientific understanding, and principles and practical criteria for distinguishing such behavior from poor  are ed. Conclusions: Recommendations focus on practical guidelines for assessing risk and activating appropriate prevention and intervention: (1) al actions and relative risk of harm to the  are both important ingredients in defining and distinguishing  emotional maltreatment from other forms of poor ; (2) poor  methods fall along a broad continuum and fit within a population health mandate aimed at reducing incidence of all forms of negative  methods; (3)  emotional maltreatment can be defined categorically based on qualitatively more extreme and potentially more harmful behaviors (than poor ), which requires a focused intervention response.

The Swiss teaching style questionnaire (STSQ) and adolescent problem behaviors,2006,"Based on evidence on , the aim of the  was to develop a teaching questionnaire and to examine links to adolescent problem behaviors. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, cluster analysis, and hierarchical linear modeling was used based on self-reports of 340 teachers (mean age 44.7 years, SD = 10.7) and their 5904 students (mean age 15.9 years, SD = 0.9). The three-dimensional factor structure could be confirmed. The dimension warmth and support was negatively associated with bullying in the class taught, and interaction between warmth and support and rides and control was negatively associated with cigarette smoking, cannabis use, and delinquency. On the other hand, psychological pressure was associated with low academic achievement. Although indications of the importance of teaching  in the prevention of multiple adolescent problem behaviors were found, differences between teaching and  make further  necessary."
The relation of parenting styles and inconsistencies to adaptive functioning for  in conflictual and violent families,2005,"Research of  in conflictual and violent families suggests that battered mothers (i.e., those experiencing verbal and/or physical abuse by their partner) may not  very differently from demographically similar nonbattered mothers. However, battered mothers do report being less consistent in their discipline. In the  , 104 mothers and their  from community nonviolent and violent families and shelter violent and violent abusive families participated in interviews to obtain information about  functioning and authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive al practices. It was the case that authoritative practices were associated with more positive  functioning and that al inconsistency, defined in terms of endorsing conflictual  practices, was associated with poorer  outcome. Groups of mothers were identified that fit different patterns of  practices, and these patterns were differentially related to 's functioning."
Effects of the affectionless control parenting style on personality traits in healthy subjects,2009,"The effects of the affectionless control (AC)   on personality traits were studied in 414 Japanese healthy subjects. Perceived al rearing was assessed by the al Bonding Instrument, which comprises care and protection factors, and personality traits were assessed by the Temperament and Character Inventory, which has seven dimensions. al rearing was classified into four types, i.e., optimal  (high care/low protection), affectionate constraint (high care/high protection), neglectful  (low care/low protection), and AC (low care/high protection). Males with maternal AC showed significantly higher harm avoidance (HA) scores and lower scores of persistence and cooperativeness than those with maternal optimal . Females with maternal AC showed significantly higher HA scores and lower self-directedness scores than those with maternal optimal . Paternal AC was not significantly related to any personality score. In females, the interaction between paternal rearing and maternal rearing was significant; the effect of maternal AC on HA scores was strongest when combined with paternal neglectful . The   suggests that the AC type  by mothers is associated with specific personality traits, especially high HA, in healthy subjects. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
Parenting style and obsessive-compulsive symptoms and personality traits in a student sample,2002,"There is widespread acceptance of the idea that aspects of  such as overprotectiveness and perfectionism contribute to the pathogenesis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) Less resolved is whether the important dimensions of  are overprotectiveness, lack of acceptance, authoritarian , discouragement of risk-taking, and/or induction of guilt. It is  unclear whether different  characteristics are associated with the development of symptoms of OCD, compared to the traits of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). OCD symptoms and OC personality traits were measured in a non-clinical, student sample and correlated with students' report of s' acceptance, disciplinary firmness, and psychological control (a construct which included psychological manipulation and guilt-induction). Following the literature on both clinical and subclinical OCD and OCPD, we predicted that all three scales would correlate with OCD symptoms and OCPD traits. Step-wise regression analysis revealed that psychological control was the unique predictor, controlling for depressive symptoms. Unexpectedly, a controlling   was not selectively associated with classical OC symptoms or OC personality traits. Rather, psychological control was associated with a broad-spectrum of anxiety and depressive symptoms which cut across diagnostic boundaries. Findings are generally compatible with a single underlying vulnerability to both OCD and OCPD, as well as generalized/social anxiety and depressive symptoms, which can be shaped by cultural and familial factors to a specific clinical ation.

Predicting latent classes of drug use among adolescents through parental alcohol use and parental style: a longitudinal study,2019,"PurposeThe   examined the roles of al alcohol use and al  as predictors of adolescent patterns of drug use.Methods6391 students in the 7th and 8th grades at 72 Brazilian public schools participated in a three-wave randomized controlled trial to evaluate a school drug-use prevention program. Patterns of drug use were identified through two latent class analyses using measures of the adolescents' past-year drug use. Multinomial logistic regression analyses examined whether al alcohol use and   at baseline predicted patterns of drug use in waves 2 and 3 of the  after controlling for sociodemographic covariates.ResultsIn each of the two waves, three latent classes of drug use were identified among the students, defining three different groups of individuals: (1) abstainers/low users, (2) alcohol users/binge drinkers, and (3) polydrug users. First,   (especially monitoring) was the strongest predictor for the prevention of polydrug use among adolescents. Second, occasional alcohol use by s can act as a central predictor for adolescent alcohol use and binge drinking. Above all, maternal episodes of drunkenness were involved in the predictive models for both drug use classes in both waves.Conclusional alcohol use and   seem to be important predictors of adolescent's likelihood of belonging to different latent classes of drug use. This conclusion may point to the importance of considering the inclusion of  skills and al alcohol use within the scope of adolescents' preventive interventions."
THE INFLUENCE OF RETROSPECTIVE ESTIMATES OF MATERNAL PARENTING STYLE IN CHILDHOOD ON THE MANIFESTATIONS OF ALEXITHYMIA AND EMPATHY AT YOUNG PEOPLE WITH POLYDRUG,2015,"The purpose of the  - the  of the impact of retrospective assessment of maternal  , implemented in hood manifestations of alexithymia and empathy at young people with polydrug. Subject of  - manifestations of alexithymia and empathic abilities of youth with polydrug, depending on the parameters of a retrospective evaluation of maternal  , implemented in hood. 50 polydrug patients, aged 20 to 30 years, a period of remission from 1.5 to 3 months and 50 - in the control group, participated in the . We used Toronto alexithymia scale, test ADOR Teens about s (E. Shafer) and test for the diagnostic of empathy (V. V. Boyko). As a , it was found, that the highest levels of alexithymia and low values of empathy observed in inconsistent policy and hostile educational  of mother, according to a retrospective evaluation of the subjects in the group of patients with polydrug, and in the control group. In the group of patients with polydrug, compared with the control group, revealed statistically significant differences between the retrospective assessment of mother' educational  of parameters, such as authoritativeness, hostility, inconsistency, that exceeded the value of the control group, as well as the parameters positive interest, autonomy, that were expressed significantly lower than in the control group. The degree of alexithymia at patients with polydrug is directly proportional to the severity of the hostile in the retrospective evaluation of the educational  of mother, and inversely proportional to the autonomy. As further perspectives of our  can be designated the  of the impact of the mother' image on the formation of motivational trends, motivational orientation in interpersonal communication and communication systems of the addicted patients, that may contribute to the improvement of psychocorrection rehabilitation programs for patients with drug addiction and for their families."
Effects of Parenting Style and Parent-Related Weight and Diet on Adolescent Weight Status,2013,"Objective This  examined the interaction between al limit setting of sedentary behaviors and health factors (weight status, physical activity [PA], fruit and vegetable [FV] intake) on standardized body mass index (zBMI) in African American adolescents. Methods Data were from 67 -adolescent dyads. al limit setting, PA and FV intake were assessed via self-report, and objective height and weight measurements were collected. Results Regressions examined the interaction between al limit setting and BMI, PA, FV intake on adolescent zBMI. The model for  BMI and FV intake accounted for 31% of the variance in adolescent zBMI. A significant interaction for  BMI by limit setting showed that as al BMI increased, higher (vs. lower) limit setting was associated with lower adolescent zBMI. Higher  FV consumption was associated with lower adolescent zBMI. Conclusion Future interventions should integrate  limit setting and target  fruit and vegetable intake for obesity prevention in underserved adolescents."
Mothers' and Fathers' Adherence to Maternal Love : Interactions With Their Marital Satisfaction and Parenting Style,2013,"In the  , effects of mothers' and fathers' adherence to maternal love on their marital satisfaction and   were examined from a family systemic perspective. Questionnaires on adherence of maternal love, marital satisfaction, and   were completed separately by 304 couples with  from 2 to 6 years-old, and the hypothesized model that s' adherence to maternal love affected marital satisfaction and   was examined. The  suggested that fathers' marital satisfaction was not affected by either their own or their partners' adherence to maternal love. On the other hand, an interaction was found between fathers' and mothers' adherence to maternal love and mothers' marital satisfaction. That is, for those couples both of whom gave lower ratings as to their adherence to maternal love, the mothers evaluated their marital satisfaction higher, whereas for those couples who were inconsistent in their adherence to maternal love, and in which the fathers rated it higher and the mothers lower, the mothers reported lower marital satisfaction. The  from the questions on   suggested that the fathers' marital satisfaction was related to their responsivity and controlling attitude toward their . Moreover, the fathers' adherence to maternal love was related to higher responsivity and a lower controlling attitude. For the mothers, interaction of the fathers' and mothers' adherence to maternal love revealed the same trend in the mothers' responsivity data as it did in the data on their marital satisfaction. That is, a congruence between the fathers' and the mothers' adherence to maternal love at a high level was related to higher maternal responsivity, whereas an incongruent adherence to maternal love, in which the fathers evaluated it higher than the mothers, was related to a lower level of maternal responsivity. These findings suggest that effects on marital satisfaction and   of adherence to maternal love differ between mothers and fathers."
"Relationship between Maternal Parenting Style and High School Achievement and Self-Esteem in China, Turkey and USA",2015,"This cross-cultural  investigated country differences in the relationship between maternal   and two important developmental outcomes of students high school achievement and self-esteem. 634 undergraduates resident in three countries (China 207, Turkey 196, USA 231) where socio-cultural orientation and previous  suggest that normative family relationships would be different, were selected. We predicted that in the three countries, different maternal   would be prevalent and would foster positive development in terms of their congruence with the prevailing individualistic or collectivist ethic of the country. Students completed Bun's  Authority Questionnaire (which yielded scores on maternal authoritarian, authoritative and permissive ), Rosenberg's self-esteem scale, and reported on their high school achievement. Results showed country differences in the prevalence of the three maternal  , and some differences in the way each   was related to student outcomes. Nevertheless, most differences were not those predicted. In particular, the Chinese findings were unexpected, as the Chinese mothers were the most authoritative, and were the only group for whom authoritarian  was negatively associated with high school achievement. Reasons for the unpredicted  are discussed as well as the need for changes in the conceptualization of  to accommodate diverse and diversifying cultures. Some novel findings from Turkey suggest the advantages of ing  in a wider range of countries to reveal the variety of family processes that contribute to positive  development."
Parenting Styles and Social Competence in Chinese Preschoolers: A Moderated Mediation Model of Singleton and Self-regulation,,"Research Findings: The impact of the newly launched two- policy on young 's social development has not been empirically studied. This  examined the possible mediating and moderating factors in the relationship between   and social competence in Chinese preschoolers. A sample of only  (Nonly- = 352, M-age = 3.96, SD = 0.62,) and  with siblings (N-with-siblings = 552, M-age = 4.02, SD = 0.64) was recruited from Fuzhou, China. Their s completed the Children's Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ), Social Competence and Behavior Evaluation (SCBE), and  Style and Dimension Questionnaire (PSDQ). The  indicated that: (1) the only  were more likely to have s of authoritative and permissive   than the  with siblings; (2) the  with siblings had higher levels of self-regulation than the only ; (3) self-regulation mediated the relations between all dimensions of   and 's social competence; (4) singleton (only  or not) moderated the mediating effect of self-regulation in the relationships between permissive   and 's social competence after controlling for  age and gender. Practices and Policy: The  have demonstrated the influence of the two- policy and how such macro-contextual change interacts with key microsystems such as the family and  behaviors in relation to early development. The findings have several practical implications for  education and home intervention."
PARENTING STYLE AS A MEDIATING LINK BETWEEN PARENTAL EMOTIONAL HEALTH AND ADJUSTMENT OF MALTREATED CHILDREN,1995,"The roles of   and s' emotional health status on 's social-emotional functioning were examined. Approaches to -rearing were expected to mediate the impact of al emotional health on  adjustment. The sample consisted of 55 - dyads characterized by  maltreatment. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that both aspects of al functioning, emotional health status and -rearing , predicted  adjustment. However, further analyses yielded support for the mediation model; the impact of emotional health on  adjustment was significantly reduced when the effects of   were controlled. Results suggest that al approaches to -rearing play a key role in shaping 's social-emotional functioning, with s' emotional health status playing a more indirect role."
Impact of Parenting Style on Clinically Significant Behavioral Problems Among Children Aged 4-11 Years Old After Disaster: A Follow-Up Study of the Great East Japan Earthquake,2019,"Objective: The purpose of this  was to investigate the influence of   on 's behavior problems after the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011. Methods: Participants were  exposed to the 2011 disaster at preschool age (n = 163). Data were collected from August 2012 to March 2013, and from July 2014 to March 2015 (2 and 4 years, respectively, after the earthquake), thus participants were aged 4-11 years when assessed.   was assessed by caregivers using the Alabama  Questionnaire (APO), which measures al involvement, positive , poor monitoring/supervision, inconsistent discipline, and corporal punishment in the second year after the disaster. Behavior problems were assessed by caregivers using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), which identifies internalizing, externalizing, and total problems in the second and fourth year after the disaster. Results: The  show that corporal punishment in the second year after the disaster had negative influence on CBCL internalizing score (coefficient: 0.78, 95%CI: 0.12-1.45, p = 0.023), externalizing score (coefficient: 0.74, 95%CI: 0.09-1.39, p = 0.025), and total score in the fourth year after the disaster (coefficient: 0.85, 95%CI: 0.16-1.55, p = 0.016), after adjusted for 's age, sex, the number of trauma experiences, maternal education, the number of siblings, temporally housing experience, and CBCL each scores in the second year after the disaster. Other   did not affect 's behavioral problems. Conclusion: The  suggests that inadequate rearing after a natural disaster had negative impact on the behavior problems of the affected  in 4 years later of the disaster. Specifically, corporal punishment had negative influence on 's behavior problems."
Listening to parents: The challenges of parenting kindergarten-aged  who are anxious,2012,"The purpose of this  was to increase understanding of the experience of  kindergarten-aged  who are anxious. Twenty-three in-depth interviews were conducted with s of kindergarten-aged  who expressed interest in a -focused early intervention program for  anxiety offered in a local elementary school. Key concerns of the s included their 's separation anxiety, social anxiety, and oppositional behaviour. The 's anxiety was identified as a stressor on the , the , and the family. s utilized a range of  responses although they tended to be reactive and did not have a consistent strategy for managing the anxiety. A salient  struggle was whether or not to push the  to face challenging situations although there were few descriptions of overprotection or overcontrol. The findings suggest greater attention be given to the strengths of s of  who are anxious and the ways in which s may be a positive factor in mitigating the effects of  anxiety. Implications for intervention are discussed."
The Influence of Parenting on Bullying Prevention: Parenting as a Moderator of Adolescents' Bullying Behaviors,2021,"Adolescent interactions with their peers, like bullying, have been linked to -adolescent interactions. However, these links have not been fully explored in bullying prevention and intervention . Evaluations of universal bullying prevention programs often find modest effects on adolescent bullying outcomes, and few studies have examined -level influences on these outcomes. It may be advantageous for those in bullying  to test the differential effects of program outcomes via moderation. The current evaluation  examines the effects of the Be SAFE bullying prevention program on adolescent bullying behaviors, as moderated by adolescent perceived . By applying a multi-level moderation model, the current  assessed changes in self-reported bullying behaviors for a sample of 82 middle school students who participated in the Be SAFE bullying prevention program. Students  self-reported their 's level of warmth, hostility, and  . This evaluation  shows that adolescents who perceived their s to be permissive increased in bullying perpetration and assisting behaviors at a higher rate than those who perceived their s as authoritative or authoritarian. These  suggest that distal factors may impact outcomes of youth prevention programs. Particularly, this 's findings show that -adolescent interactions may impede the effectiveness of bullying prevention efforts. Future evaluations of bullying prevention programs should use moderation analyses to understand how proximal and distal factors may impact youth program outcomes."
"Adolescent Substance Use in the Context of the Family: A Qualitative Study of Young People's Views on Parent-Child Attachments, Parenting Style and Parental Substance Use",2016,"Background: Adolescent substance use can place youth at risk of a range of poor outcomes. Few studies have attempted to explore in-depth young people's perceptions of how familial processes and dynamics influence adolescent substance use. Objectives: This article aimed to explore risk and protective factors for youth substance use within the context of the family with a view to informing family based interventions. Methods: Nine focus groups supplemented with participatory techniques were facilitated with a purposive sample of sixty-two young people (age 13-17years) from post-primary schools across Northern Ireland. The data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Three themes emerged from the data: (1) - attachments, (2)  , and (3) al and sibling substance misuse. - attachment was identified as an important factor in protecting adolescents from substance use in addition to effective  particularly an authoritative  supplemented with al monitoring and strong - communication to encourage  disclosure. Family substance use was considered to impact on 's substance use if exposed at an early age and the harms associated with al substance misuse were discussed in detail. Both  and  gender differences were cross-cutting themes. Conclusion:  programmes (tailored to mothers and fathers) may benefit young people via components on authoritative , al monitoring, communication, nurturing attachments and - conflict. Youth living with more complex issues, e.g., al substance misuse, may benefit from programmes delivered beyond the family environment, e.g., school based settings."
Parent- relationships during the divorce process: From attachment theory and intergenerational perspective,2005,"This  examined four possible predictors of al satisfaction in the first year after divorce: Attachment ,  , perception of own s' , and the ex-spouse's assessment of the quality of the 's . Findings among 49 divorced couples showed that the mothers' satisfaction was anchored in themselves and their behavior, fathers' satisfaction in their perceptions of their mothers and ex-wives. Among mothers, the less dismissing their attachment  and the greater the centrality of the  in their  , the more satisfaction they tended to report. Among fathers, greater satisfaction was predicted by more education, perception of their own mother as less overprotective, and their perception of their ex-wife's approval of the quality of their fathering."
Multi-faceted discipline strategies of Chinese parenting,2017,"al disciplining of their misbehaving  continues to draw much  attention. Baumrind's typology of   has been frequently used to classify Chinese  as more authoritarian. Although influential,  tends predominantly to focus on abstract characterization. Yet,  is a practice informed by specific cultural ethnotheories and enacted in response to their 's behavior in specific contexts. Our  attempted to explore this type of disciplining in situ. We interviewed 89 mothers from Taiwan (45) and Hong Kong (44) with  from near the end of infancy to beginning-school age. Mothers were asked to share their disciplinary strategies for handling four hypothetical yet common situations in which  misbehaved. These situations varied in setting, social distance among participants, possible consequences, nature of rules involved, and degree of conflict. We found five strategy types. Moreover, mothers prioritized them differently for different situations. Finally, we identified four ways of using strategies: single, contingent, simultaneous, or ratcheting-up. Depending on their strategies in a given situation, these uses  varied. We were compelled to conclude that Chinese  is more multi-faceted than has been typically portrayed in . Implications for future  on  across cultures are discussed."
How-to parenting program: A randomized controlled trial evaluating its impact on parenting,2022,"How to Talk so Kids will Listen & Listen so Kids will Talk is a universal  program hypothesized to teach three key  components: autonomy support, affiliation, and structure. To assess its impact on these components, we conducted its first randomized controlled trial. We recruited 293 - dyads, which we randomized into 30  groups. Fifteen groups received the program immediately (How-to condition), while the other half received it 14 months later (waitlist condition). s and their  (M-age = 7.60) rated  autonomy support, affiliation and structure at pre- and post-intervention as well as at six- and twelve-month follow-ups. At post-intervention, s in the How-to condition reported more autonomy support than s in the waitlist condition and, for those scoring low on affiliation or structure at pre-intervention, more affiliation and (potentially) structure, respectively. Limited differences were reported by . Post-intervention differences remained stable over the 12-month follow up."
Beyond Provisions: The Relationship Between Poverty Status and Parenting Among Single Mothers,2008,"Using data from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth 1997 ( NLSY-97), this  provides a descriptive portrait of the relationship between poverty and  among single mothers of adolescent . This  contributes to our understanding of how strongly and consistently poverty status relates to various  dimensions, including  , monitoring, relationship quality, and limit-setting. This  extends prior work by focusing on within group variation of  of single-mother family structures, and including non-poor single mothers in the analyses. Using multinomial logistic and OLS regression,  indicate poverty status is unrelated to the , relationship quality, and monitoring of single mothers, but it is moderately related to greater involvement in limit-setting. Overall, the experience of poverty does not appear negatively related to the  of single mothers. These  indicate poor single mothers appear to manage their al strategies equally well compared to non-poor single mothers. (C) 2007 by The Haworth Press. All rights reserved."
Reliability of the Emotion-Related Parenting Styles Scale Across Gender and Parent Status Groups,2015,"Research Findings: Emotional and social competence are critical to a 's current and future well-being. A. D. Paterson et al. (2012) studied a sample of mothers and proposed that an adult's approach to the socialization of a 's emotions can be summarized in his or her   as measured by the Emotion-Related  Styles (ERPS) scale. These  are emotion approving, emotion disapproving, active socialization, and uncertain/ineffective socialization of negative emotions. This  aimed to determine whether the ERPS scale is a reliable measure of the emotion socialization  of s and non-s of both genders. Participants were 521 undergraduate students-males (n = 76), females (n = 445), s (n = 290), non-s (n = 231)-with a mean age of 32.26 years (SD = 9.92, range = 18-61 years). There were no significant differences between the ERPS subscale scores of s and non-s, but males and younger adults showed higher disapproving and uncertain responses. The factor structure of the ERPS was confirmed for females. One factor was found to be unreliable for males. Practice or Policy: The ERPS is a reliable measure of the emotion socialization  of females. Further  is required to establish the scale's reliability with males."
"Investigating Helicopter Parenting, Family Environments, and Relational Outcomes for Millennials",2014,"To examine the relationship between helicopter  and Millennials' personal and interpersonal problems, Millennials (N = 268) reported on their s' helicopter ,  , and family communication patterns and their own neuroticism, interpersonal dependency, and coping efficacy. Results revealed helicopter 's positive associations with the authoritarian   and conformity orientation and Millennials' neurotic tendencies, dependency on others, and ineffective coping skills. In addition, a new Helicopter  Instrument (HPI) emerged as a viable alternative measure of this phenomenon. The implications of helicopter 's negative effects include dysfunctional family environments, Millennials' stunted development, and overburdened college campuses."
"Sexism in adolescence: parenting styles, division of housework, prosocial behaviour and aggressive behaviour",2017,"The aim of this  was to identify which factors were the best predictors of sexist attitudes. To achieve this aim, two groups of variables were analysed. The first group consisted of variables relating to   and the division of housework. The second group consisted of personal factors related to prosocial behaviour and physical and verbal aggression. The sample was made up of 732 adolescents aged 12-14 from Valencia (Spain). The analysis was conducted separately for boys and girls. Correlation analyses and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted on each subsample. The  show that the division of housework and   were related to sexist attitudes. This connection was especially strong for the division of housework according to traditional gender roles, which was found to lead to hostile and benevolent sexist attitudes. The   showed that prosocial and aggressive behaviours were correlated with sexist attitudes. The  varied by gender. The findings of this  have implications for the prevention of sexist attitudes."
Affectionless control: A parenting style associated with obesity and binge eating disorder in adulthood,2021,"Objective Obesity is rising globally with a heavy health and economic burden. Early attachment experiences are relevant to the development of obesity. The purpose of this  was to investigate if al care and attachment  experienced in hood is associated with obesity, with or without binge eating disorder (BED), in adulthood. Method al , personality traits, and psychopathology were assessed in 810 clinically referred adults with obesity, of whom 357 with BED and 453 without BED (non-BED), and 463 healthy subjects (HS). Assessments included the al Bonding Instrument, Temperament and Character Inventory, Eating Disorder Inventory-2, Symptom Checklist-90 and Beck Depression Inventory-II. Results Both BED and non-BED reported lower maternal and paternal care and higher overprotection than HS. BED reported worse levels of al care than non-BED and HS. 'Affectionless control'   was more frequently reported by both BED and non-BED than HS. No significant differences in   emerged between BED and non-BED. Conclusions Perception of al 'affectionless control' was associated with obesity in adults, and lower quality of al care was more frequently reported by participants with BED. al  may constitute an important target for early interventions to prevent obesity."
Parenting Styles and Gender-Linked Drinking Behaviors in Dominica,2011,"We explored links among adult alcohol consumption, personality, and retrospective hood relationships with s using psychometric instruments adapted for use among Dominicans (n=58; 25 men and 33 women). Compared to women, men consumed more alcohol and cigarettes, reported lower behavioral inhibition, and lower maternal caringness (all p <.05). Results suggest that, with respect to drinking,   predispose opposite developmental trends for men and women. Women who recalled their mothers as more caring tended to have higher behavioral activation seeking (BAS) scores and  to drink more. For men BAS was negatively correlated with maternal caring, but did not significantly correlate with alcohol consumption. Women who recalled their fathers as more controlling tended to drink less (p=.026), but men who recalled their fathers as more controlling tended to drink more (p=.0002). Maternal controllingness was  positively associated with alcohol consumption in men (p=.002), but showed no association with drinking in women."
"Ego development, psychopathology, and parenting problems in substance-abusing mothers",2008,"The authors examined maternal ego development in relation to psychopathology and  problems in a sample of substance abusing mothers. Given predilections at higher levels of ego development for introspection and guilt, the authors expected mothers at higher levels to report more psychopathology. Given predilections at lower levels of ego development for dichotomous perceptions and limited conceptions of causation, the authors expected mothers at low levels to report more problematic  behaviors. Intelligence was expected to correlate but not overlap with ego development. Subjects were 182 mothers who expressed interest in a randomized clinical trial for a new  intervention. Measures included the Washington University Sentence Completion Task-Short Form, the al Acceptance-Rejection Questionnaire, the Brief Symptom Inventory and the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test. Results of correlation and multivariate analyses of variance confirmed predictions. Implications for future development of interventions for substance abusing mothers are discussed."
"Impact of parenting, reward, and prior achievement on task persistence",2018,"The purpose of this  was to test the impact of reward, prior achievement,  , and s' educational and income levels on second graders' task persistence in the face of a challenging task. The participants were 179 s graders enrolled in one of three public schools in the Sanhurfa. Participants were randomly assigned to success, no-reward, and reward groups. On the pre- and posttest, participants' task persistence was measured through engagement with an unsolvable labyrinth puzzle. Stepwise multiple regression was calculated to predict students' task persistence based on students' gender, mother and father education, income,  , pretest  and experimental grouping (success, no-reward, reward). Regression analyses pointed only to reward as a significant predictor of students' task persistence. Students' task persistence decreased on average 421 s when a reward was removed. Task persistence for the success and no-reward groups was significantly higher than for the reward group."
parental goals and parenting practices of upper-middle-class Korean mothers with preschool ,2009,"In order to understand how mothers develop their   under rapidly changing cultural contexts, this  examines and compares Korean upper-middle-class mothers' al goals and real  practices as they reported. For this purpose, face-to-face in-depth interviews with 20 Korean mothers were conducted. By analyzing the data, we found that Korean mothers'  beliefs focused on 'raising a  with good social and emotional characteristics', while their reported practices mainly concentrated on 's academic achievements. Korean mothers failed to connect their beliefs and behaviors because they tended to compare their  practices with those of other mothers. Although the mothers followed expectations from current Korean society, they constantly had to deal with guilty and uncomfortable feelings of not corresponding with their personal al beliefs and goals."
"Parenting practices, parental attachment and aggressiveness in adolescence: A predictive model",2012,"The aim of this  was twofold: a) to test the mediation role of attachment between  practices and aggressiveness, and b) to clarify the differential role of mothers and fathers with regard to aggressiveness. A total of 554 adolescents (330 girls and 224 boys), ages ranging between 16 and 19, completed measures of mothers' and fathers'  practices, attachment to mother and to father, and aggressiveness. Acceptance/involvement of each  positively predicted an adolescent's attachment to that , and coercion/imposition negatively predicted attachment to a lesser extent. Using structural equation modeling, a full mediation model provided the most parsimonious explanation for the data. With attachment in the model, the paths between the two  practices and aggressiveness were minor and statistically non-significant. Only attachment to the father, was predictive of adolescents' aggressiveness. Results are discussed in the light of the importance of the father-son/daughter relationship in adolescence.

How parenting style affects false belief understanding,1999,"This  investigated whether mothers facilitate false belief understanding, and if so, what strategies are particularly relevant. The mothers of 64 3- and 4-year-olds were given questionnaires eliciting information about mother's education mother's occupation, number of younger and older siblings, the time the  spends with mother, and about how mothers deal with Jive disciplinary situations with their . Three variables were positively correlated with belief understanding age,;number:of older siblings, and number of times mothers said they would respond to the disciplinary situations by asking the  to reflect on the victim's feelings (How Feel responses). These three variables had an independent effect on belief understanding because each was significant after accounting for the influence due to; the other two variables. In contrast, there was no significant positive relation between belief understanding and mothers who engaged their  in general discussion and exploration of the disciplinary issues, or who simply reprimanded the  without discussing the situation. The effects for number of older siblings and How Feel responses remained even after the influence due to the 's age, verbal mental age, time spent with the mother, and number of younger siblings was accounted for. The  are consistent with recent :showing that - relations may be important for theory of mind understanding. More importantly, they provide insight into aspecific strategy by which s may help  learn about mental states."
"Parenting style of Mexican, Mexican American, and Caucasian-non-Hispanic families: Social context and cultural influences",2004,"To begin accounting for cultural and contextual factors related to  rearing in Mexican-descent (MD; Mexican American and Mexican immigrant) families in the United States, the current  examined  practices in 2- families of Mexican, MD, and Caucasian-non-Hispanic (CNH) s. s in all groups reported using authoritative practices more often than authoritarian strategies. MD s reported greater use of authoritarian practices than Mexican and CNH s. Results suggest that previously found cultural variations in  between MD s and CNH s may be more related to the ecological context of MD families than to an affiliation with Mexican culture. Clinicians should explore the positive qualities of authoritative  in MD families along with the potential motivations for using authoritarian strategies."
"Stress, competence, and parental educational styles in victims and aggressors of bullying and cyberbullying",2017,"Background: The family can be a protective/risk factor for violence. The  analyzes differences in family variables (al stress, al competence and  ) among severe student victims, aggressors, cybervictims, and cyberaggressors (who have very frequently suffered or carried out bullying/cyberbullying behaviors in the past year) and those who have neither suffered nor carried out any aggressive behavior or only occasionally. Method: Participants were 1,993 students in the 5th-6th grade (9-13 years old). Results: Victims and aggressors of bullying had s with higher levels of al stress, who used more authoritarian educational  (low affection, coercive discipline, high control), and more permissive practices (high affection/overprotection, low demand/control); s of aggressors  had a lower level of al competence. Cybervictims had s with higher al stress who used more permissive educational . Cyberaggressors had s with a low level of al competence. Conclusions: The family context is relevant for bullying/cyberbullying, but family variables have more influence on bullying than on cyberbullying."
Intercultural Parenting in Australia: Managing Cultural Differences,2017,"This  employed a qualitative and social constructionist approach to examine cultural differences in intercultural  and how s negotiated cultural differences. Semistructured, in-depth interviews were conducted with 14 intercultural couples/s. Thematic analysis was used to analyze data and understand the meanings of participants' experiences. The findings revealed that while intercultural couples experienced several similar aspects of  experienced by monocultural couples, their experiences were exacerbated because of the cultural differences. The most common descriptions of differences and uniqueness in  were identified as (a) discipline, (b) sleep patterns, (c) cultural taboos refood and traditional medical practices, (d) 's socialization process, (e) education, (f) language and communication, (g) role of , and (h) the role of extended families. Five major conflict resolution strategies were identified: (a) communication, (b) compromise, (c) sphere of rule, (d) asymmetrical decision-making, and (e) individual traits. Practical implications for therapists and counsellors working with intercultural s/couples are discussed."
Interparental Conflict Styles and Parenting Behaviors: Associations With Overt and Relational Aggression Among Chinese Children,2011,"This  examined how interal conflict  related to Chinese 's overt and relational aggression directly and indirectly through  behaviors. Mothers (n = 670) and fathers (n = 570) reported their overt and covert interal conflict  and different  behaviors. Children's (n = 671) aggression was assessed by peer nominations. Consistent with previous , coercive control and psychological control showed positive associations with 's overt and relational aggression, which varied by - gender. The significant indirect effects of interal conflict  showed that paternal overt conflict was positively related to boys' aggression mediating through paternal coercive control and that maternal covert conflict was positively related to boys' aggression mediating through psychological control. Discussions regarding - gender moderations and implications of the findings in the Chinese cultural context are provided."
Asian culture in transition: is it related to reported parenting styles and transitivity of simple choices?,2013,"Does culture shape reported   and cognitive processes like transitive reasoning, of choosing A over B, B over C, and then A over C (transitivity)? Asian-American, Caucasian-American, and Indian university students differed significantly in transitivity and in reported al . India participants were more intransitive and, contrary to traditional findings in the literature, reported their s as more laissez-faire, individualistic, and competitive than did Caucasian-Americans. Recent technological and industrial advances in India likely explain some of these obtained differences. Predictions from Adlerian theory and work of Kurt Lewin, that   would relate to transitivity of choices, were indirectly supported. Stronger evidence was found that culture impacts both reported al  and transitivity of simple choices."
Longitudinal relations between  vagal tone and parenting behavior: 2 to 4 years,2004,"The longitudinal relations between physiological markers of  emotion regulation and maternal  practices were examined from 2 to 4 years of age. At Time 1, cardiac vagal tone was assessed for one hundred four 2-year-olds (54 females); their mothers completed an assessment of  . Two years later at Time 2, 84 of the original participants were reassessed on measures of cardiac vagal tone and  . Results indicated both baseline cardiac vagal tone and maternal  practices to be stable from 2 to 4 years of age. Children's cardiac vagal tone predicted specific  practices from the toddler to preschool years. Further,  cardiac vagal tone moderated maternal restrictive- practices from 2 to 4 years of age; mothers of  who were highly or moderately physiologically dysregulated were more likely to report restrictive  practices at both 2 and 4 years of age.

Prenatal maternal personality as an early predictor of vulnerable parenting style,2019,"Perinatal mental health problems, particularly depression, are prevalent and have been a central focus of prevention initiatives. The greater proportion of ongoing annual perinatal mental health economic cost burdens relate to . A key linking mechanism is mother-infant relationship quality. Perinatal depression symptoms are typically transient. However, personality , including interpersonal sensitivity, is a more stable construct and predicts proneness to depression and common mental disorders. Building on our previous work, the objective of the   is to examine the association between specific dimensions of prenatal interpersonal sensitivity and postpartum mother-infant relationship quality in the context of prenatal depression symptoms. We analysed data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of s and Children (ALSPAC). Interpersonal sensitivity and depression symptoms were measured at 18 weeks gestation. In a randomly selected 10% subsample of the ALSPAC cohort, mother-infant interaction was measured through standard observation at 12 months postpartum. For the subsample that had complete data at all time points (n = 812), multiple regression models examined prenatal interpersonal sensitivity dimensions predicting postpartum mother-infant relationship quality, accounting for depression symptoms. Two dimensions of maternal interpersonal sensitivity modestly predicted mother-infant relationship quality at 12 months postpartum and remained robust when we controlled for depression symptoms. The interpersonal sensitivity subscales were significantly associated with prenatal depression symptoms but more consistently and robustly predicted postnatal mother-infant interaction quality. The inclusion of personality measures may strengthen prenatal mental health assessment to identify vulnerability to suboptimal mother-infant relationship quality."
"Does Parenting Style Matter? Concerted Cultivation, Educational Expectations, and the Transmission of Educational Advantage",2015,"Recent work on the transmission of educational advantage has shifted empirical attention toward the active role of s and their  . Drawing from cultural capital theory and using longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) (N = 512), this  examines how a specific  of , concerted cultivation, and educational expectations relate to adolescents' academic achievement. Results from a recursive structural equation model (SEM) confirm a direct relationship between educational expectations and achievement, but not for concerted cultivation. However, subsequent analyses indicate that educational expectations  mediate the relationship between a 's social background and academic achievement. These  provide insights into the family's role in the transmission of educational advantage and contribute to the larger public and scholarly debate regarding explanations for the stratification of educational outcomes."
Relation of attitude toward body elimination to parenting style and attitude toward the body,2003,"The purpose was to estimate the relation of attitude toward body elimination in 93 college students (27 men and 66 women), to authoritarian personality features, participants' perception of their mothers'  , and attitudes toward cleanliness, sex, and family nudity. Subjects were administered the Body Elimination Attitude Scale, the Four-item F Scale, the al Authority Questionnaire Pertaining to Mothers, and the items Sex is dirty, Cleanliness is next to godliness, and Children should never see other family members nude. Larger scores for disgust toward body elimination were associated with authoritarian personality characteristics, being less likely to describe mother's   as authoritative (open communication) and more likely to describe it as authoritarian and lower scores for tolerance for family nudity. Implications for further  were suggested."
Cortisol and Parenting Predict Pathways to Disinhibited Social Engagement and Social Functioning in Previously Institutionalized Children,2020,"Previously institutionalized  on average show persistent deficits in physiological and behavioral regulation, as well as a lack of normative reticence towards strangers, or disinhibited social engagement (DSE). Post-adoption , specifically a combination of supportive presence and structure/limit-setting, may protect against DSE over time via better adrenocortical functioning. This  examined the impact of adrenocortical activity and post-adoption  on DSE across the first two years post-adoption (age at adoption: 16-36 months) and observed kindergarten social outcomes in previously institutionalized  (n = 94) compared to non-adopted  (n = 52). Path analyses indicated a developmental cascade from institutional care (operationalized as a dichotomous group variable, age at adoption, and months of institutionalization) to blunted adrenocortical activity, increased DSE, and lower kindergarten social competence. Consistent with a permissive  , higher al support was associated with increased DSE, but only when not accompanied by effective structure/limit-setting. Further, al structure reduced the association between blunted adrenocortical activity and DSE behaviors."
"The Relationship between Post-Traumatic Symptoms, Parenting Style, and Resilience among Adolescents in Liaoning, China: A Cross-Sectional Study",2015,"Background In China, a growing number of adolescents have experienced traumatic events that have ed in PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). Post-traumatic symptoms are common psychological problems in adolescents who have experienced traumatic events. However, existing studies tend to focus on the factors influencing PTSD, such as the response  and social support, and studies on the relationships between  , resilience and post-traumatic symptoms are still rare. Objectives To analyze the relationships between  , resilience and post-traumatic symptoms among adolescents in China. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted from June to December 2013 in the Liaoning Province, China. N = 5765 adolescents (aged 12 to 18 years old) were ultimately chosen to participate. The Chinese version of the Essen Trauma Inventory for Kids and Juveniles (ETI-KJ), a modified version of the al Authority Questionnaire, and the Chinese Resilience Scale were used to estimate the post-traumatic symptoms,  , and resilience, respectively. Pearson's correlations, multiple linear regression analyses and structural equation modeling (SEM) were applied to analyze the data. Results Of the adolescents, 39.76% (N = 2292) had been exposed to traumatic events during their lives. The prevalence of probable PTSD at the time of the interview (one-month-prevalence) was 12.65%.   and resilience were significantly associated with post-traumatic symptoms. According to the SEM,   had a significant direct effect on resilience (0.70, P<0.01) and post-traumatic symptoms (-0.15, P<0.05), and resilience had a significant direct effect on the post-traumatic symptoms (-0.43, P<0.01). Furthermore,   had a significant indirect effect (-0.43x0.70 = -0.30. P<0.01) on the post-traumatic symptoms through resilience. The SEM significantly explained 49% of the variance in resilience and 30% of the variance in post-traumatic symptoms. Conclusions   and resilience have significant effects on adolescents' post-traumatic symptoms. Schools and social-related departments could share knowledge on the impact of   with s enabling them to improve their own   and their 's resilience and ability to respond effectively to traumatic events."

Parenting practices and their relevance to  behaviors in Canada and China,2010,"Recent studies have revealed that s in different cultures endorse different -rearing practices. Studies in the West suggest that there is a cluster of behavioral characteristics in  that are linked with each type of  . Mixed , however, were found in non-Western countries. This  examined (1)  practices in Canadian and Chinese mothers, and (2) the relevance between  practices and  behaviors in Canada and China. Forty Canadian  (average age = 5.40) and 39 Chinese  (average age = 4.84) and their mothers participated in the . Information on maternal authoritative and authoritarian behaviors and 's behaviors, including coercive request, polite request, and assertiveness, was obtained from observations of mother- interactions in a laboratory situation. The  indicated that Chinese mothers were less authoritative and more authoritarian than Canadian mothers. Both cross-cultural differences and similarities were found on the associations between maternal  practices and  behaviors."
Differential impact of parental region of birth on negative parenting behavior and its effects on  mental health: Results from a large sample of 6 to 11 year old school  in France,2016,"Background: In France, one in 10 residents has immigrated mainly from North Africa, West Africa or the Caribbean including the French West Indies. However little is known about how s from these regions behave when they migrate to countries that have different cultural norms. It is therefore important to determine how ethno-cultural background affects al behavior and subsequent  mental health in the context of immigration. The objectives are: 1) to compare negative  behaviors of French residents from diverse ethno-cultural backgrounds 2) to examine the relationship between al region of origin and  mental health, and 3) to investigate the extent to which ethno-cultural context moderates the effect of   on  mental health. Methods: A cross-sectional  was conducted in 2005 in 100 schools in South-East France. The Dominic Interactive and the -reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire were used to assess  psychopathology. The  Behavior and Attitude Questionnaire was used to assess  . The final sample included data on 1,106 mother and  dyads. Results: Caring and punitive attitudes were significantly different across mothers as a function of region of origin. This association was stronger for punitive attitudes with the highest prevalence in the Caribbean/African group, while mothers from Maghreb were more similar to French natives. Differences in caring behaviors were similar though less pronounced. Among  of Maghrebian descent, punitive  was associated with an increased risk of internalizing disorders while this association was weaker among  of African and Afro-Caribbean descent. Conclusions: al region of origin is an important component of both   and their effect on  mental health. Interventions on  should consider both the region of origin and the differential impact of origin on the effect of  , thus allowing for a finer-grained focus on high-risk groups."
"Parenting Style, Parental Stress, and Mediation of Children's Media Use",2019,"al mediation  is based largely in studies of TV mediation, with recent work examining mediation of 's video game and internet use. Few scholars have explored mediation of cell phone use. Some  has examined mediation in the context of  , but  suggests that al stress can  influence mediation behaviors. This  extends the findings on TV mediation to cell phones and explores the role of al stress in mediation. The findings indicate that few factors are associated with both TV and cell phone mediation, and that al stress plays a significant role in the mediation process."
From parental personality over parental styles to  psychopathic tendencies,,"We examined the role of al personality traits and   in explaining psychopathic tendencies in  at the beginning of elementary school. One hundred seventy-three s fulfilled the Big Five Inventory and  Styles Questionnaire for themselves and Child Problematic Traits Inventory for their  (80 boys; M = 5.28 years, SD = 4.12 months). Results revealed a complex interplay between al personality traits,  , and 's psychopathic tendencies. Overall, two path analyses revealed that al Psychopathy Resemblance Index (PRI) has both direct and indirect effects on  psychopathy; al Agreeableness has both direct and indirect negative effects; Neuroticism through the authoritarian and permissive   has a positive indirect effect; Openness has a direct negative, while Extraversion has a direct positive effect on 's psychopathic tendencies. Thus, the permissive and authoritarian   are modelled by al personality, and they both seem to play an important role in 's psychopathic tendencies. However, all observed effects were small, which can have important implications for early interventions."
Relationship of Adult Representations of Childhood Parenting and Personality Tendencies to Adult Stressors and Political Ideology,2011,"Undergraduate students in a Southeastern US University (n = 232) responded to an inventory that included retrospective measures of their s'  of  (authoritarian vs. authoritative) and their own hood psychological tendencies (insecurity vs. confidence), as well as their adult stressors and political orientation. Authoritative  positively correlated with hood confidence and negatively correlated with both hood insecurity and adult stressors. Conversely, authoritarian  was positively associated with hood insecurity and adult stressors but was not significantly correlated with hood confidence. For the most part,  , early hood tendencies, and adult stressors were unrelated to adult political ideology, contrary to previous longitudinal  reporting these connections."
Attachment style and prenatal expectations from a Bayesian perspective,2020,"Background: The transition to motherhood is sometimes characterized by ambivalent emotions. This paper attempts to explore whether this transition may be triggering attachment insecurities in first-time pregnant women during their first trimester, and thus affecting their prenatal expectations and caregiving reations. Method: A sample of 100 first-time pregnant women during their first trimester was studied. Prenatal expectations were explored in terms of desire to have  (DTC), perceived ability to relate to  (PARC), personal meaning ascribed to motherhood, and preoccupations regarding becoming a mother. Results: The estimated Bayesian network shows that attachment  is a predictor for prenatal expectations, either directly or indirectly. Results  suggest that PARC mediates the relationship between attachment and the preoccupations related to motherhood. Pregnant women with an insecure attachment  reported lower PARC and higher preoccupations about becoming a mother. Conclusion: Pregnant women with secure attachment have more positive pre-hood expectations and  reations than those with insecure attachment. These  may be useful in clinical settings to help women have a smoother transition to motherhood."
Children's Age and Gender Differences in Internet Parenting Styles,2019,"The aim of this  is to examine whether the Internet family  changes according to age and gender. The  was based on a quantitative cross-sectional survey design. The participants of the  were randomly sampled from secondary and high school students in Sakarya - Turkey. A total of 1839  participated in this . As a  of the  it was seen that al control and al warmth were high in both females and males in the 10-11 age group. This shows that families maintained high levels of control and warmth with regard to the Internet at younger ages, however control and warmth continues to decrease for both genders in later ages. Considering gender, in males, al control and al warmth with regard to the Internet was seen to decline substantially at the age of 12. In females, al control and warmth for the use of Internet decline substantially at the age of 14. Moreover, when compared to males, this decline occurs two years later."
Parenting perspective on the psychosocial correlates of adolescent sexual and reproductive health behavior among high school adolescents in Ethiopia,2019,"BackgroundWhile s are a crucial part of the social environment in which adolescents live, learn and earn, they could play important roles in efforts to prevent adolescent sexual and reproductive health (SRH) risk behaviors and promote healthy development. Involving s in prevention programs to risky SRH practices in adolescents requires understanding of the effect of different  practices and  on these behaviors. The purpose of this  was to investigate the relationships between various aspects of perceived  and self-reported engagement in sexual risk behavior among adolescents.MethodsA cross-sectional  was employed among 406 randomly selected 14-19years old high school adolescents in Legehida district, Northeast Ethiopia from 15 February to 15 March/ 2016. Structured and pre-tested self-administered questionnaire adapted from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance questionnaire was used for the data collection. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis with odds ratio along with the confidence interval of 95% were used. P-value <0.05 were considered for statistical significance.ResultsAbout two-third (64.5%) of the participants reported that they had ever had sex. Nearly half (48.6%) of the participants who were currently sexually active reported that they engaged in at least one type of risky sexual behavior. Specifically, 42.7% reported starting sexual life earlier, 32.2% having more sexual partners in the past 12months and 23.8% never used condom during the most recent sexual intercourse. High quality adolescent relationships (AOR=0.53; 95% CI (0.45-0.63) and authoritative form of  (AOR=0.74; 95% CI (0.61-0.92) were associated with lower odds of engaging in risky sexual behaviors in adolescents. The odds of risky sexual behaviors were about three-fold higher in adolescents who perceived al knowledge as poor (AOR=2.97; 95% CI (1.51-4.25) and to some extent (AOR=3.00; 95% CI (1.43-5.55) toward SRH than those whose s were very knowledgeable. Adolescents with poor behavioral beliefs on SRH issues had a 37% increased odds of engaging in risky sexual behaviors.ConclusionsTherefore, to engage the s within preventive interventions design to support healthy SRH behaviors among adolescents, the role of authoritative  , and improved quality of -adolescent relationship, as well as improving adolescents' behavioral beliefs and al knowledge towards SRH are essential."
Characteristics of perceived parenting styles in Japan using the EMBU scale,1999,"Objective: The EMBU (Egna Minnen av Barndoms Uppfostran) is a self-report questionnaire for the assessment of one's memory of al rearing experiences. We are interested in using this scale to determine the characteristics of perceived   in Japan. Method: The  subjects consisted of 1320 healthy Japanese volunteers, comprising 687 males (52%) and 633 females (48%). We investigated the relationship between demographics and the EMBU scale. Results: ANCOVA revealed that the subject's gender had a significant effect on paternal rejection scores (male > female), and both gender and birth-order position had significant effects on emotional warmth scores for both s (female > male, and only- > middle or last-born ). Birth-order position had significant effects on maternal overprotection, with the highest score being that of only , and on the aspect of favouritism (favouring subjects), scores for both s were highest from the last-born . Rejection scores for the mother were significantly higher than those for the father from female subjects. Among both male and female subjects, emotional warmth scores and overprotection scores for the mother were significantly higher than those for the father. Among male subjects, scores for the mother on favouritism of the subject were significantly higher than those for the father. On the other hand, among female subjects, scores for the father on favouritism of the subject were higher than scores for the mother. Conclusion: Our  suggest that   have significant interrelationships with the gender and birth-order position of the subject."
Socioeconomic Health Inequalities in Adolescent Metabolic Syndrome and Depression: No Mediation by Parental Depression and Parenting Style,2021,"We assessed to what extent al depression and   mediate the relationships between different measures of al socioeconomic status (SES) and both depression and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in adolescents, and whether sex moderates these mechanisms. Data were from the prospective multigenerational Dutch Lifelines Cohort Study. Our sample consisted of 1217 adolescents with an average follow-up of 33.3 (SD = 7.33) months and a median baseline age of 13 (IQR:13-14) years. We used structural equation models to assess the direct and indirect effects of SES on baseline and changes at follow-up in both depression and MetS, and to assess moderation by sex. For each additional year of education, continuous MetS scores were 0.098 (95%CI: 0.020; 0.184) units lower at baseline and decreased 0.079 (95%CI: 0.004; 0.158) units at follow-up. No other direct or indirect effects of SES were found, and there was no moderation by sex. Additionally, warmer   was generally associated with more favorable outcome scores. Therefore, improving   may improve health for all adolescents. However, in this  al depression and   did not account for adolescent socioeconomic health inequalities. This may be partly due to good access to social services within the Netherlands."
"Mediators between Parenting History and Expected At-Risk Parenting: Role of Conformity, Coping, and Attitudes",2017,"The current  used a multimethod approach to consider potential mediators and moderators of the relationship between harsh, authoritarian  history and future at-risk  defined as  abuse potential and authoritarian . The  involved 114 less undergraduate students, a group that could re a potential target group for  abuse prevention efforts. The role of coping, conformity, and attitudes towards harsh discipline were evaluated and considered as potential moderators or mediators of future at-risk . Attitudes that approve of - aggression and greater conformity were found to partially mediate the relationship between a history of authoritarian  and future at-risk . In other words, approval of - aggression and an inclination to be more socially conformist partly explained the relationship between a history of harsh, authoritarian discipline as  and whether participants expected to become harsh s. However, neither greater coping skill nor lower conformity moderated the association between  history and at-risk . This  implies that altering the acceptability of - aggression could serve as an important prevention target in pre-s to minimize the likelihood of adopting at-risk  practices. Additionally, the role of social conformity in at-risk  warrants further investigation given the current findings suggest that part of why one may later assume a harsh at-risk  approach reflects embracing a conformist ."
Increasing Wellbeing through a Parenting Program: Role of Gender and Partnered Attendance,2015,"Coping skills provide a resource for tackling stress in everyday situations, including those relating to . The aim of this article is to establish whether s who experienced a 10-hour universal social emotional  program-Families Coping (FC) - benefit through increased productive coping strategies, decreased nonproductive coping strategies, and increased  wellbeing, within a positive  framework. It is  of interest to see whether gender and/or partner attendance makes a difference in program outcomes such as coping  and wellbeing. The data set combined two groups of s (N = 23) of preschool-aged  from an early learning centre in inner-metropolitan Melbourne in 2013 and 2014 who undertook the FC  program. A mixed methods design was employed, where s completed pre- and post-program questionnaires on coping and wellbeing. Results were considered with respect to gender and partner attendance. A one-way repeated-measures multiple analysis of variance (RM-MANOVA) showed a significant increase in one productive   (Dealing with the Problem), a significant decrease in nonproductive  coping, and a significant increase in  wellbeing. Comparison of  between gender and partner attendance groups showed minimal differences in program effectiveness. Qualitative data mostly confirmed the key findings."

"SEVERITY OF BORDERLINE PERSONALITY SYMPTOMS IN ADOLESCENCE: RELATIONSHIP WITH MATERNAL PARENTING STRESS, MATERNAL PSYCHOPATHOLOGY, AND REARING STYLES",2015,"The development of borderline personality disorder (BPD) has been associated with   and al psychopathology. Only a few studies have examined current al rearing  and al psychopathology in relationship to BPD symptoms in adolescents. Moreover,  stress has not been examined in this group. The current  examined 101 adolescents (14-19 years old) with BPD symptoms and their mothers. Assessments were made on severity of BPD symptoms, youth-perceived maternal rearing , and psychopathology and  stress in mothers. Multiple regression analyses were used to examine potential predictors of borderline severity. No correlation was found between severity of BPD symptoms in adolescents and  stress. Only youth-perceived maternal overprotection was significantly related to BPD severity. The combination of perceived maternal rejection with cluster B traits in mothers was significantly related to BPD severity in adolescents. This  provides a contribution to the disentanglement of the developmental pathways that lead to BPD."
"Acculturation, food-related and general parenting, and body weight in Chinese-American ",2022,"s' food-related and general  behaviors may vary according to cultural background, with consequences for  eating behavior and weight. A better understanding of food-related and general  behaviors adopted by Chinese-American s, and the relationships of all of these behaviors with  weight, is essential to aid the development of culturally appropriate interventions to prevent obesity in ChineseAmerican . We investigated cross-sectional relationships of acculturation with al feeding behaviors assessed with the Child Feeding Questionnaire,  Feeding Styles Questionnaire and Caregiver's Feeding Styles Questionnaire, and general  behaviors assessed with the  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire, in a sample of Chinese-American s of 5-12 year-old  (n = 233). al level of acculturation was assessed using the Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identity Acculturation scale. We performed generalized linear regressions to explore associations of acculturation levels with al feeding and general  subscales and  associations of these factors with  body mass index (BMI) z-score. Acculturation was associated with higher scores on Responsiveness in feeding, lower scores on subscales assessing controlling feeding behaviors (Restriction, Pressure to eat, Demandingness in feeding), lower scores on non-nutritive feeding behaviors (Emotional feeding, Instrumental feeding), and greater likelihood of an indulgent feeding . With regard to general , acculturation was associated with lower scores on subscales assessing authoritarian . al Prompting/Encouragement to eat was associated with lower  BMI z-score, while authoritarian  subscales were associated with higher BMI z-score. An appreciation of the impact of cultural variation on food-related and general  may help to inform the development of culturallysensitive obesity prevention interventions."
Parenting the Internet,2006,"Telephone surveys of single and married mothers of teenagers in public schools, mothers of teenagers in religious schools, and mothers of homeschooled teenagers examined the influence that   and level of Internet access in the home have on  mediation of online content and time spent on the Internet (N = 520). Specifically, how authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and neglectful   as well as home and bedroom Internet access influence the evaluative and restrictive mediation techniques used by s was investigated. Results indicate that   has a significant effect on almost all mediation techniques studied, whereas increased access only influences time online.

Natural Parenting and Religion in Francophone Contexts,2020,"New entanglements between  (in theory and practice), environmentalism, religion, spirituality, and secularism are at the core of the analysis ed in this article. In francophone contexts, discourses by practitioners, advocates and detractors of natural  contribute to associating this specific  of  and several of its key practices with religion and spirituality. After documenting and defining natural  by listing its characteristic practices and underlining its values as well as its important overlap with attachment , this article examines the historically religious roots of movements linked to several practices still regarded as typical of natural  (natural birth movements, natural family planning or fertility awareness, and breastfeeding advocacy). Along with feminist and medical strands of criticism, within these highly secular contexts, the association with religion and spirituality participates in the criticism of this  of  which combines the key tenets of attachment  with a strong environmentalist agenda implemented for the most part in the domestic sphere and around women's bodies."
Paternal -rearing style and  social anxiety: Investigation of  perceptions and actual father behavior,2002,"This  examined associations among perceived and actual father behavior and  social anxiety. Forty-eight  (22 high socially anxious, 26 low socially anxious) completed self-report measures of social anxiety, general anxiety, and depression. Children  completed a measure of perceived al  and subsequently collaborated with their fathers on a challenging task (origami). After controlling for general anxiety and depression, fathers of high socially anxious  exhibited more controlling behavior during the origami task; high and low socially anxious , however, did not differ behaviorally from one another. Perceptions of father -rearing  did not differ as a function of  social anxiety, nor were significant relations found between perceived  and specific father behaviors. Findings underscore the importance of assessing various types of internalizing symptoms (i.e., controlling for shared construct variance), obtaining 's perceptions of al  in conjunction with conducting behavioral observations, and including fathers in psychopathology ."
"Perception of Parenting Style by Children with ADHD and Its Relation with Inattention, Hyperactivity/Impulsivity and Externalizing Symptoms",2016,"Children's perception of their s' behavior is very important for their adjustment. Raising a  with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can be particularly challenging. However, little is known about how  with ADHD perceive their s' -rearing . The main purpose of this paper is to  how  with ADHD perceive acceptance and control in - relationships and this perception's relationship with inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and externalizing behaviors. Participants were  between 7 and 13 years old with ADHD who were attending psychotherapy (ADHD),  without ADHD who were attending psychotherapy (APG), and  with unknown ADHD status who were not attending psychotherapy (NPG). Furthermore, one  of each  participated in the . An analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that  with ADHD perceived higher levels of pathological control in their relationships with their mothers than did APG and NPG . NPG  perceived higher extreme autonomy than ADHD and APG . Linear regression analyses revealed that the perception of pathological al control and extreme autonomy predicted externalizing symptoms in  with ADHD. The perception of maternal acceptance and pathological control predicted inattention in APG . Also, perceived maternal pathological control and perceived paternal acceptance predicted externalizing symptoms in APG . Thus, these  show the importance of taking into account 's perception of their relationships with their s in addition to al reports of their own behavior."
DESIGNING AND TESTING A MODEL OF IMPORTANT ANTECEDENTS OF ADDICTION AMONG REFFERING MALE ADDICTS TO HEALTH CENTERS,2016,"The aim of this  was to investigate conceptual model of antecedents of addiction (authoritative  , authoritarian, permissive and social support of family and friends) among reffering male addicts to health centers in Zanjan city, Iran. The population in this  was all of the male addicts who are reffering to health centers. From this population 250 male addicts were selected using convenience sampling method. The  instruments were Baumrind's   inventory, Phillips social support questionnaire and er made questionnaire of check status of drug use. The proposed model was tested using structural equation modeling. According to the , the proposed model had an acceptable fitness regarding the fitness indices.

Positive parenting in foster care: A video-feedback intervention to promote positive parenting - theory and practice,2021,"Foster  are known to be at high risk for developing attachment problems. Moreover, their associated behavioural problems can be a burden for the foster family and increase the risk of placement breakdown. A sensitive   promotes a secure attachment which, in turn, can reduce the chance of difficulties arising and protect against placement disruption. Interventions using video-feedback of - interactions offer a method of increasing al sensitivity and improving the quality of the - attachment. The intervention discussed in this article was part of a wider initiative, Video-feedback Intervention to promote Positive  and Sensitive Discipline (VIPP-SD), fashioned to promote sensitive , secure attachment and a reduction in 's behavioural problems. Its effectiveness has been shown for a variety of target groups. A variant of the approach was developed specifically for foster and adopted , Video-feedback Intervention to promote Positive  and Sensitive Discipline - Foster Care/Adoption (VIPP-FC/A). This article discusses the design and delivery of the intervention and illustrates these with case material."
Acculturation Profiles and Associations With Parenting Among Immigrant Latinos,2017,"Acculturation and accompanying acculturative stress affects the  practices of Latino immigrants. We (a) examine acculturation profiles based on heritage culture orientation, mainstream culture orientation, familismo, and acculturative stress; (b) describe how social support informs Latinos' acculturation profiles; and (c) test how these acculturation profiles are associated with  behaviors (including al involvement, monitoring, agency, and discipline self-efficacy) and family conflict. A three-step latent profile analysis revealed five profiles of acculturation: Cultural Individualism (n = 168, 15%), Cultural Engagement (n = 810, 71.3%), Cultural Assimilation (n = 47, 4.3%), Cultural Disengagement (n = 23, 2.1%), and Cultural Stress (n = 77, 7.3%). Social support predicted the Cultural Engagement profile, which was associated with positive  behaviors and family functioning. The Cultural Stress profile was associated with detrimental  behaviors and family conflict. Recommendations include family interventions that effectively support and strengthen culturally competent coping strategies in response to acculturative stress as a means to promote positive  practices."
Gene-environment interaction: Oxytocin receptor (OXTR) polymorphisms and parenting style as potential predictors for depressive symptoms,2021,"Depression is a common mental health problem that is thought to develop through a combination of genetic, psychological, and environmental factors, including al behaviours and al mental health.

Intraspecific variability in parenting styles of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta): The role of the social environment,2001,"This  tested the hypothesis that differences in   between two captive populations of rhesus macaques, one living in the UK (Madingley) and the other in the USA (Yerkes), are associated with differences in the degree to which social interactions with other group members pose a risk to infants. Twenty-eight mother-infant dyads, 17 living at Madingley and 11 at Yerkes, were observed for 24 h during the first 12 wks of infant life. Mother-infant dyads living at Madingley spent a higher percentage of time in contact than those living at Yerkes. The Madingley mothers  restrained and retrieved their infants more often, and rejected them less often than the Yerkes mothers. Consistent with the prediction, the protective   of the Madingley mothers was associated with higher frequency of infant kidnapping and higher risk of infant harassment from other group members. Interpopulation differences in risks to infants and   are likely to be the  of differences in social density in the two environments rather than differences in the matrilineal structure of the two populations."
An evaluation of a behavioural parenting intervention for parents of gifted ,2009,"s of gifted  identify a need for tailored  support, and gifted  have unique requirements and vulnerabilities. The aim of this  was to assess the efficacy of a tailored behavioural  intervention, for enhancing the  skills of s of gifted  and to assess the effect of these changes on the behavioural and emotional adjustment of their gifted . A randomised controlled trial of tailored Group Triple P - Positive  Program was conducted with 75 s of  identified as gifted. Results indicated significant intervention effects for the number and frequency of  reported  behaviour problems, as well as hyperactivity in the intervention group, relative to a waitlist control. s  reported significant improvements in their own  , including less permissiveness, harshness, and verbosity when disciplining their . No intervention effects were evident for teacher reports, except for a trend in relation to hyperactivity. This  demonstrated that a tailored behavioural  intervention is effective and acceptable for s of gifted , and thus has clinical implications for the delivery of  interventions for this population.

"Helicopter Parenting, Authenticity, and Depressive Symptoms: A Mediation Model",2020,"Helicopter  is an overinvolved, overcontrolling   that likely interferes with 's healthy development of authenticity. Authenticity refers to self-awareness and a genuine expression of the self and is important for college students as they traverse the opportunities and challenges of emerging adulthood. Authenticity appears to be a protective characteristic and is negatively related to depressive symptoms. The authors proposed and tested a model in which helicopter  was related to depressive symptoms through authenticity. In the  investigation, college students (n = 286) completed self-report instruments assessing perceptions of helicopter , current states of authenticity (self-alienation, authentic living, external influence), and depressive symptoms. Path analysis was conducted with AMOS, and the data fit the model well (chi(2)(1) = .580, p = .446, TLI = 1.103, CFI = 1.000, RMSEA = .000). Helicopter  was related to higher levels of self-alienation and external influence and lower levels of authentic living. Self-alienation and authentic living were related to depressive symptoms (external influence was not related to depressive symptoms). These findings demonstrate the importance of considering developmental predictors of authenticity and depression. Helicopter  is likely to inhibit authenticity in ways that may contribute to difficulties in emerging adulthood."
First-Year Female College Students' Academic Motivation as a Function of Perceived Parenting Styles: A Contextual Perspective,2015,"The connections between three   (authoritarian, permissive, and authoritative) and three motivational constructs (extrinsic/intrinsic and amotivation for learning) of 202 Palestinian-Arab young females were tested. This  used structural equation modeling statistical method and smallest space analysis (SSA, a variant of multidimensional scaling MDS) to compute the complex relationships indicated in previous  between the examined variables. Results showed that the participants perceived their s as more authoritative than authoritarian or permissive. According to the path analysis , the authoritative   was negatively connected to amotivation, the authoritarian was positively related to extrinsic motivation, and a positive relation was found between permissiveness and amotivation for learning. Only the SSA has confirmed the postulated connection between the authoritative   and intrinsic motivation variables. Implications of these findings and directions for future  are discussed."

Influence of mothers' parenting styles on self-regulated academic learning among Saudi primary school students,2017,"Much of the  on self-regulation has investigated the influence of school settings. However, fewer studies have concentrated on the home environment and its influence on student's academic behaviour in school. The   investigates the influence of mothers'   on students' self-regulated learning behaviours in schools. The  included 351 primary students (11 and 12 years-old) and their mothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The  was conducted using a cross-sectional survey design in which mothers were asked to complete a  Styles Questionnaire (Robinson, Mandleco, Olsen & Hart, 1995) and their  completed a modified form of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (Pintrich, Smith, Garcia & McKeachie, 1991). Results differ from what had been reported in the literature. We find that Saudi mothers tend to be authoritative rather than authoritarian (cf. Dwairy et al. 2006; Achoui, 2003). We find that authoritative  are significantly and positively related to students' self-efficacy, cognitive and metacognitive strategy use, and  and time management, whereas permissive  are significantly but negatively correlated to self-efficacy and metacognitive self-regulation. Authoritarian  have a small negative influence on time and  management and a small positive influence on help seeking, both effects being marginally significant."
Parenting practices are associated with fruit and vegetable consumption in pre-school ,2010,"Objective: s may influence 's fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption in many ways, but  has focused primarily on counterproductive  practices, such as restriction and pressure to eat. The   aimed to assess the association of diverse  practices to promote F&V and its consumption among pre-school . Design: An exploratory analysis was performed on cross-sectional data from 755 Head Start pre-school  and their s collected in 2004-5. Data included  practices to facilitate  F&V consumption (grouped into five categories); -reported dietary intake of their  over 3d; and a number of potential correlates. K-means cluster analysis assigned s to groups with similar use of the food  practice categories. Stepwise linear regression analyses investigated the association of  clusters with 's consumption of F&V, after controlling for potential confounding factors. Results: A three-cluster solution provided the best fit (R-2 = 0.62), with substantial differences in the use of  practices. The cluster were labelled Indiscriminate Food , Non-directive Food  and Low-involved Food . Non-directive s extensively used enhanced availability and teachable moments' practices, but less firm discipline practices than the other clusters, and were significantly associated with  F&V intake (standardized beta = 0.09, P < 0.1; final model R-2 = 0.17) after controlling for confounders, including al feeding . Conclusions: s use a variety of  practices, beyond pressuring to eat and restrictive practices, to promote F&V intake in their young . Evaluating the use of combinations of practices may provide a better understanding of al influences on 's F&V intake."

The participants provided evidence of authoritative  . We  examined the applicability of Chao's construct of Chinese  guan (?) for adolescence; the participants seemed to support the idea, but viewed the underlying meaning of guan differently than described in earlier studies conducted with mothers of younger . We thus argue that guanjiao (??), which means to govern and to educate/teach, may be a more appropriate word to use than guan to describe urban, middle-class Chinese mothers' approach to  of adolescents. The findings  suggest that neither Chao's construct of guan nor Baumrind's prototypes could fully capture its essence. Additional elements, such as modeling, self-sacrifice, and expression of affection through behavior,  emerged as common themes."

Results: The adolescents diagnosed with substance use disorder had less secure and preoccupied attachment and more fearful and dismissed attachment than did their normal counterparts. In addition, the adolescents diagnosed with substance use disorder had less family and total social support than did normal adolescents, and their family gave them less al acceptance and involvement, less attitude control, and less psychological autonomy. Conclusion: The implementation of a therapeutic, structured mental support program by psychiatric nursing could be beneficial for adolescents who have substance use disorder."
Predictors of parenting stress among Malaysian mothers of  with Down syndrome,2010,"Background Having  with intellectual disability can be stressful for most s. Currently there are very few studies focusing on  stress among mothers of  with Down syndrome (DS) in Asia. The   examined the level of  stress experienced by Malaysian mothers of  with DS and evaluated the  and maternal factors that contributed to  stress based on Hill's ABC-X Model (Hill 1949). Methods We conducted a cross-sectional  of mothers of  with DS between the ages of 2-12 years during February-June 2008 in Kedah, a state in Peninsular Malaysia. We used self-administered questionnaires to gather data on  stress, 's birth history and current behavioural problems, as well as the maternal sociodemographic characteristics, coping  and psychological well-being. al Stress Scale (PSS) was used to assess  stress. Measures of 's behavioural problem using Pediatric Symptom Checklist, mother's coping  using Carver et al. (1989) COPE inventory and their psychological well-being using Lovibond and Lovibond (1995) DASS21, a scale assessing depression, anxiety and stress were  carried out. Results The 147 mothers who participated in the  had an average age of 43.1 years (SD = 7.6 years), of whom 94.6% were married, 57.1% had secondary level education and 28.6% were working outside their home. Based on PSS, mean  stress was 37.6 (SD = 8.1).  stress was significantly higher among mothers who reported having  with behavioural problems. However,  stress was modified by positive coping  and negative maternal psychological well-being. The final model based on hierarchical regression analysis identified maternal depression and lack of acceptance as significant predictors of  stress rather than 's behavioural problems. Conclusion Mean  stress among mothers of  with DS significantly differed by behavioural problems in their .  stress is  significantly correlated with frequent use of acceptance, religious and optimist coping , and presence of maternal depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms. However, hierarchical regression analysis identified maternal depression and lack of acceptance of having a  with DS as the most significant predictors of  stress in these mothers."

"Authoritarian parenting, perfectionism, and academic procrastination",,"We aimed to investigate the indirect effects of authoritarian  on academic procrastination through various dimensions of perfectionism, including concern over mistakes, doubts about one's actions, high personal standards, and organisation. We conducted a survey of 743 college students in China to collect information on perceived authoritarian , perfectionism, and academic procrastination. Social learning theory guided our exploration of whether perfectionism mediated the link between authoritarian  and academic procrastination. The  of structural equation modelling showed that among perfectionism dimensions, only concern over mistakes mediated the association between perceived authoritarian  and academic procrastination. Authoritarian  was positively associated with concern about one's mistakes and high personal standards. Concern over mistakes was positively associated with academic procrastination, whereas personal standard and organisation were associated negatively with academic procrastination."
Longitudinal prediction of early hood discipline styles among heavy drinking parents,2009,"This  sought to examine predictors of  trajectories in a sample of heavy drinking and abstaining/light drinking s. Mixture modeling was used to estimate trajectories of al discipline  over time. Two dimensions of  were examined: laxness and overreactivily. Changes in these dimensions were examined for each . Trajectories for mothers and fathers were very similar and were generally stable from 18 months to 5-6 years  age. Fathers' binge drinking was associated with high levels of both paternal and maternal overreactivity. Mothers with depressed affect had the highest levels of overreactivity, whereas fathers reporting depressed affect were more likely to have moderate levels of laxness. Mothers with high levels of marital satisfaction were more likely to have partners in the stable low overreactivity group. Findings begin to elucidate the nature of early family processes that may contribute to maladaptive  Outcomes in heavy drinking families. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Authoritative parenting and parental stress in parents of pre-school and older  with developmental disabilities,2006,"Background: Rearing a  with a developmental disability is associated with increased al stress. Theories of stress and adjustment and bi-directional theories of  development suggest that  could influence these negative outcomes. Methods: Relationships between  approaches and stress in s of  with developmental disabilities (DD) (N = 53) were examined across two age groups, 3-5 years and 9-11 years and compared with a contrast group of typically developing  (TD) (N = 60). Measures used were the  Stress Index-Short Form and Rickel and Biasatti's modification of Block's Child Rearing Practices Report, classified into Baumrind's   using Reitman and Gross's method. Results: s in the older DD group used Authoritative  less than s in the younger DD group, while the opposite developmental pattern was seen in the TD group. Multivariate analysis of variance showed a significant group x   interaction for al Distress, -Child Dysfunctional Interaction and Difficult Child. Stress measures were higher for the DD group and seemed to be associated with Authoritative  approaches, an effect that was not observed in the TD group. Conclusions: Findings suggest that the well-established effect of group on stress may be moderated by  . Authoritative  may be highly stressful for s of  with DD to implement, ing in a decrease in its use across the two age groups."
The roles of parenting styles and social capital in the school performance of immigrant Asian and Hispanic adolescents,2005,"Objective. This  investigates the role of   and social capital (al involvement, intergenerational closure, expectation, and trust) in accounting for school performance among ethnic groups and across immigrant generations. Methods. Using data from the Adolescent Health Survey, we estimate fixed-effects models to analyze students' grade-point averages. We compare three generations of Asian students and three generations of Hispanic students to the third-generation (native born with native s) white students. Results. We find significant differences by both race/ethnicity and generational status in   and forms of social capital. However, while family socioeconomic status (SES) accounts for the achievement gap between foreign-born Hispanic and the third-generation white students,   and forms of social capital do not moderate any ethnic-generational differences. Conclusions. Family influences, apart from SES, cannot explain ethnicity-generation differences in school grades among Hispanic and Asian adolescents. This  provides conceptual clarification and empirical evidence for the significant but independent association between students' school grades and   on the one hand, and social capital on the other."
"Examining a conceptual model of parental nurturance, parenting practices and physical activity among 5-6 year olds",2016,"Rationale:  is an often-studied correlate of 's physical activity, however there is little  examining the associations between  , practices and the physical activity of younger . Objective: This  aimed to investigate whether physical activity-based  practices mediate the association between   and 5-6 year-old 's objectively-assessed physical activity. Methods: 770 s self-reported   (nurturance and control) and physical activity-based  practices (logistic and modeling support). Their 5-6 year old  wore an accelerometer for five days to measure moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Linear regression was used to examine direct and indirect (mediation) associations. Data were collected in the United Kingdom in 2012/13 and analyzed in 2014.

Pathogenic Beliefs Mediate the Relationship Between Perceived Negative Parenting and Psychopathology Symptoms,2017,"Negative  , such as abuse, neglect, and intrusiveness, is significantly related to subsequent development of psychopathology. Here we sought to examine pathogenic beliefs as a potential mechanism of change. We explored whether pathogenic beliefs help explain the relationship between perceived negative   and common psychopathology symptoms. This  assessed the psychometric properties of the self-report Pathogenic Beliefs Scale and tested its mediating effect on the relationship between negative  and psychopathology. A community sample of 732 adults completed an online survey that included measures of perceived negative   (MOPS), pathogenic beliefs (PBS), and a transdiagnostic measure of common indicators of psychopathology (anxiety, low self-esteem, emotional instability, pessimistic attitude, and depression). Results showed that pathogenic beliefs were significantly associated with negative  experiences in hood and adult psychopathology symptoms. Moreover, pathogenic beliefs mediated the relationship between negative   and psychopathology. Implications for clinical practice are discussed."
Disparate parenting and step-parenting with siblings in the post-divorce family: Report from a 10-year longitudinal study,2007,A longitudinal  of divorced families shows widely discrepant psychological adjustment among siblings along with disparate relationships with s and steps in one half of the families at the 10 year follow-up. These differences in sibling adjustment and - relationships were not evident at the divorce assessment. This instability in many - relationships following divorce and remarriage challenges the view of divorce as an acute time-limited crisis for  and court policy that assumes that - relationships at divorce will remain relatively unchanged over the years that follow. Findings  show the power of remarriage to reshape   of biological s.
Extending  on the consequences of parenting style for Chinese Americans and European Americans,2001,"This  examined the effects of -adolescent relationships on school performance to provide a clearer understanding of why authoritative  does not have as beneficial effects for Asian Americans as it does for European Americans. Over 500 adolescents of Chinese- (148 first and 176 second generation) and European-descent (208 primarily third generation or more) families from seven different high schools completed measures of (1)  , (2) -adolescent closeness (cohesion subscale from the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Environment Scales II and relationship satisfaction), and (3) school performance. Positive effects of both authoritative  and relationship closeness on school performance were found for European Americans and, to some extent, second-generation Chinese, but not first-generation Chinese. These effects were  stronger for European Americans than first-generation Chinese. Through examination of the mediating role of -adolescent relationships, this   found that among European American families, the beneficial effects of authoritative  are explained through relationship closeness."
"Online Game Addiction Relationship With Cognitive Distortion, Parenting Style, and Narcissistic Personality Traits in Students",2019,"Objectives Online games in recent years have become one of the most popular hobbies among teenagers due to their diverse and attractive features. The purpose of this  was to investigate the role of cognitive distortion,  , and narcissistic personality traits in online games in high school boy in Sahneh City, Iran. Methods This is a survey and a correlational . The  sample consists of 200 male high school students in the city of Sahneh, Iran who were selected randomly by a multi-stage sampling method. For data collection, online gaming addiction questionnaire, cognitive disturbance questionnaire,   questionnaire, and narcissistic personality traits questionnaire were used. In this , the correlation and multiple regression were used to analyze the obtained data in SPSS V. 21. Results The findings showed that online addiction can be predicted by a linear combination of predictive variables. Based on regression analysis,   (P=0.001, beta=0.46), narcissistic personality traits (P=0.001, beta=0.34), and cognitive disturbance (P=0.025, beta=0.11) could significantly predict students' addiction to online games. Conclusion These variables can play an effective role in addiction to play online games. Considering these variables, authorities of schools and other educational institutions should design and implement appropriate monitoring and control programs for this common problem."

Validation of a multidimensional assessment of parenting styles for low-income African-American families with preschool ,2002,"This  examined the construct and concurrent validity of the  Behavior Questionnaire-Head Start (PBQ-HS), a modification of the PBQ (Hart, Nelson, Robinson, Olsen, & McNeilly-Choque, 1998), with low-income African-American families with preschoolers. The   investigated whether   differed by caregiver characteristics. The sample included 465 primary caregivers of urban Head Start . Factor analyses yielded Active-Responsive, Active-Restrictive, and Passive-Permissive  dimensions. Concurrent validity data on Limit-Setting, Warmth, and Directiveness revealed similarities between the Active-Responsive and Active-Restrictive dimensions and Baumrind's authoritative and authoritarian dimensions, respectively. The Passive-Permissive dimension and Baumrind's permissive  differed. Low education levels and single hood were associated with Active-Restrictive and Passive-Permissive .

A sample of 111 young adults completed questionnaires assessing their perceptions regarding their s' intimate relationship and  quality, their own attachment , and their own expectations regarding intimate relationships. A correlational analysis revealed a positive link between the s' relationship and  quality, and between  quality and expectations about intimacy, which supports the attachment theory. A cluster analysis identified three distinct groups of al profiles interrelated with attachment  that had varying effects on their 's expectations about intimacy. These findings emphasize the unique characteristics of al relations in the family of origin relations, which have an enduring effect on the interpersonal  of adult , providing additional support to an integrated, intergenerational approach to family dynamics."
Relationship between maternal parenting and eating self-efficacy in overweight  when stressed,2013,"Background Emotional eating is associated with negative eating habits and obesity. s may be able to decrease the risk of emotional eating in  by promoting greater self-efficacy to engage in healthy eating behaviors. Our goal was to determine the relationship between certain  behaviors and eating self-efficacy (ESE) to consume healthy foods during times of emotional stress in a population of overweight/obese . Methods Eighty  (60 % female; mean BMI percentile = 98.4 %; 79.2 % White) completed a survey that assessed their ESE when stressed, feeling down, or bored. Children  reported on mothers'  behaviors coded along three factors: acceptance-based  (AC), psychological control (PC), and firm control (FC). Correlations and multiple linear regression models were used for analysis. Results AC was positively correlated with ESE when stressed. PC and FC were inversely correlated with ESE when feeling down. In the multivariate regression, only FC was significantly inversely associated with ESE when feeling down. Conclusion Results suggest that overweight  who perceive their mothers to exhibit firm control have lower ESE to make healthy choices when feeling sad. These  suggest that pediatric obesity programs should place a stronger focus on decreasing firm control behaviors among s in order to help  engage in healthier eating behaviors."
Other people's : inclusive parenting in a diversified neighbourhood in Norway,2019,"This article explores how s include other people's  in intensive  practices. Increased diversification of Norwegian society calls attention to opportunities for social mobility and the risk of greater inequality. However, insufficient  has been carried out into how s pursue  in such a context. How are  practices informed by increased diversity? Why and how do s become engaged with other people's ? This  explores the concept of intensive , which ers view as commonplace among Western middle-class s, and which leads to individualizing . It argues that for some, intensive   incorporates inclusive  - a responsibility not only towards their own , but a concern for and time investment in other people's . This   is linked to a desire to create a more egalitarian society, and a belief that a 's upbringing and future depends upon the wellbeing of other people's ."
Parenting Impacts from a Mindfulness-Based Pilot Intervention for Families Facing Pediatric Chronic Pain,2020,"Objectives The current project examines   and common psychological stressors specific to  behavior reported among s of an adolescent with chronic pain. s provide crucial pragmatic and emotional supports for adolescents' engagement in healthcare behaviors and may  experience significant emotional distress around caring for adolescents with chronic pain. Families coping with pediatric chronic health conditions often report more negative family dynamics, characterized by simultaneously unresponsive and demanding  behaviors, than families with healthy . Methods Participating s completed the s as Coping Coaches (PaCC), 3-session, group intervention developed to directly support  individual needs and  behavior. Results Findings suggest that  participation in the newly developed PaCC intervention was significantly related to reductions in  experiences associated with caring for the adolescent and -reported authoritarian  . Conclusions Significant differences seen pre- to post-intervention suggest that  experiences and  behaviors are amenable intervention targets."
Parenting practices and interventions among marginalized families in Appalachia - Building on family strengths,1996,"Using an ecological framework, the various contexts for  among marginalized families in Appalachia are discussed. Appalachian   are thought to be functional adaptations to a rural and often socioeconomically depressed environment within this geographical region. Characteristics of  , s themselves, and their  are reviewed. Further, attention is paid to how family life professionals respond to these characteristics. Finally, suggestions are made for how professionals may cooperate with s through the offering of support, information, and skills that are culturally responsive."
Modifying the Positive Parenting Program' for parents with intellectual disabilities,2013,"Background Many s with intellectual disabilities (ID) want and/or need professional guidance and support to learn skills and strategies to prevent and manage  behaviour problems. However, the available support is rarely suitable, and suitable support is rarely available. The aim of this  was to determine whether a popular mainstream  training programme, known as Group Triple P' (Positive  Program), could be successfully modified for this  group. Method A pilot  was undertaken to determine whether a modified version of Group Triple P would engage and retain s with ID. A non-experimental, pre-test post-test , involving a total of 30 s with ID, was then undertaken to obtain preliminary efficacy data. Results  engagement and participation levels were high. No  dropped out' of the programme. After completing the modified Group Triple P programme, s reported a decrease in psychological distress, maladaptive  and  conduct problems. s reported high levels of satisfaction with the information and support they received. Conclusion Research-informed adaptation of mainstream behavioural family interventions, such as Group Triple P, could make suitable support' more readily available, and more engaging for s with ID."
Reciprocity in Parenting of Adolescents Within the Context of Marital Negativity,2009,"The authors investigated the degree to which s become more similar to each other over time in their rearing behaviors. Mothers and fathers of 451 adolescents were assessed at 3 points in time, with 2-year lags between each assessment. Data on  warmth, harshness, and monitoring were collected by  self-report, adolescent report, and observer ratings of family interactions. After controlling for earlier levels of ,  education, and adolescent deviancy, spouse's  and marital negativity were significant predictors of later . Marital negativity tended to be a stronger predictor of fathering than mothering. For fathers, associations between spouse's  and later fathering were strongest in marriages characterized by low negativity."
"Whither IVF assisted birth or spontaneous conception? Parenting anxiety, styles and  development in Jamaican families",2013,"Objective: This  compared Jamaican s who were assisted to reproduce through in vitro fertilisation or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) with s who conceived spontaneously (SC) for differences in  anxiety, perceived burden of having a  and  ; and whether the cognitive and social-adaptive development of the  of these s differed. Background: Despite the growing popularity of assisted reproductive technology (ART), the change in attitude towards and acceptance of ART by society has not been considered much in the relevant literature. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 IVF/ICSI s and 60 SC s using measures of   and anxiety, spousal relationship and impact of having a  on the family. First-born , 7 years and under, were assessed using standardised measures of cognitive and social-adaptive functioning. Results: SC s reported higher levels of  anxiety, emotional burden and the  impacting negatively on family life. Regardless of type of conception, only age was predictive of  anxiety. There were no significant differences in  practices between the groups, but SC s reported  beliefs that were permissive or autocratic in nature. IVF  obtained higher mean scores on IQ measures and most social-adaptive domains. Linear regressions showed that s' education was associated with communication skills. Conclusions: IVF/ICSI s were not more anxious than SC s in a culture where ART is emerging and seemingly controversial. The findings have implications for coping with having a  not only for IVF/ICSI families but for young families in general."
"Positive Parenting, Beliefs About Parental Efficacy, and Active Coping: Three Sources of Intergenerational Resilience",2014,"Prior  involving s (G1) and their adult  (G2) shows intergenerational continuity in positive . Previous , however, has not shown circumstances under which the typically modest effect size for intergenerational continuity is augmented or attenuated. Using a multigenerational data set involving 290 families, we evaluated 2 potential moderators of intergenerational continuity in positive  (i.e., beliefs about  efficacy and active coping strategies) drawn from prior theoretical work on predictors of  (Belsky, 1984). These personal resources of the second-generation (G2)  interacted with G1 positive  to predict G2  behavior. Beliefs about al efficacy and active coping both compensated for low levels of G1 positive  by promoting G2 positive  when G1 s were comparatively low on positive . An alternative interpretation of this moderation is that G1 positive  compensated for low levels of these personal resources by promoting G2 positive  when G2 s were comparatively low on  efficacy and effective coping. These findings indicate the different roles that these personal resources and a history of positive  appear to play in promoting a positive  environment for the next generation of ."
Factor Analysis of the Italian Version of the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire in a Community Sample,2016,"Despite difficulties measuring  , many studies have demonstrated a significant relationship between disruptive  and certain  practices. One of the most frequently used scales to measure   is the Alabama  Questionnaire (APQ). This scale was originally defined based on theoretical dimensions and using samples from the USA. Therefore, both factor analysis studies and its adaptation to other countries have been proposed to improve and widen its use. The aim of this  was to adapt the APQ to the Italian population. A community sample of 258 mothers and  (94 %) and 192 fathers (70 %) from 274 families with  from 10- to 14-years-old who agreed to participate and met the inclusion criteria completed the APQ. Principal components and exploratory factor analyses ed in a unique 19-item version of the APQ for mothers, fathers, and . This unified version has ed in two factor categories: positive (12 items) and negative  (7 items). The internal consistency and goodness of fit of the model were satisfactory. Moderate and significant convergent validity were found for mothers and fathers but not for . In fact, we found differences in validity rates among the participants. Children perceived less positive and more negative  than did fathers and mothers, and mothers believed that they provided more positive  than did other s. In conclusion, the APQ Italian version of the s and  global report forms are considered a suitable measure for positive and negative   with acceptable validity and reliability indices."
The relationship between self-esteem and parenting style - A cross-cultural comparison of Australian and Vietnamese Australian adolescents,1999,"Within Western cultures, self-esteem consistently has been demonstrated to be inversely related with   characterized by low levels of acceptance and high levels of overprotection (i.e., affectionless control). Although in traditional collectivist cultures there may be a preference for this  , within a strong collectivist framework it is not thought to have a negative impact on self-esteem. However, for immigrant adolescents, the cultural context of collectivism may no longer support such a   as adaptive, particularly because they tend to acculturate more quickly than their s. To investigate this proposal, 118 Vietnamese Australian and 120 Anglo-Australian adolescents, aged 11 to 18 years, were recruited. They were administered the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory; the al Bonding Instrument, an acculturation measure; and two subscales of Eysenck's Personality Questionnaire. As expected,  characterized by high levels of overprotection and low levels of acceptance related negatively with self-esteem for both samples of adolescents."
Buds of Parenting in Emerging Adult Males: What We Learned From Our Parents,2011,"The authors examine the precursors of  buds (reations regarding  before actual ) by following 60 men from adolescence to emerging adulthood. Quality of relationships with s, and attachment reations (state of mind with respect to attachment and attachment ) assessed in adolescence, contribute to the development of  buds in emerging adulthood (desire to have , perceived  capacity, satisfaction with future , self-as-a- and future- perceptions). Quality of relations with s in emerging adulthood is  associated with  buds. Qualitative analyses reveal distinct profiles of  buds among participants with different attachment reations. The findings highlight the importance of ing  buds as part of the attempt to understand the development of the caregiving behavioral system."
"THE RELATIONSHIP AMONG PARENTING STYLES EXPERIENCED DURING CHILDHOOD, ANXIETY, MOTIVATION, AND ACADEMIC SUCCESS IN COLLEGE STUDENTS",2007,"The current  examined the relationships among   experienced in hood, anxiety, motivation, and academic success in college students. Results suggested that fathers' authoritative  was related to decreases, whereas mothers' authoritarian  was related to increases, in college students' anxiety. Further, mothers' and fathers' authoritative , mothers' authoritarian , and college students' anxiety and motivation were related to college students' grade point averages. In addition, college students' motivation served a mediational role in the relationship between their anxiety and grade point averages. Results suggested that college students may be more likely to experience improvements in their academic performance with interventions that address college students' perceptions of the  that they received during their hood, their anxiety, and their motivation to do well academically. The role of such interventions deserves to be studied further."
"Parenting styles and socio-demographic dynamics associated with mental health of in-school adolescents in Ibadan, south-west Nigeria",2019,"Background: Positive  and enabling socio-demography, engenders good conduct in adolescence. Balanced al demandingness and emotional responsiveness, deployed by authoritative s, supports adolescents? mental health. al emotional responsiveness deters peer-pressured risky behaviours; while al negligence, permissiveness, or demandingness encourages mental health problems. This is especially in the context of unfavourable socio-demographic setting. Aim: We aimed to evaluate   and socio-demographic factors associated with adolescents? mental health. Method: A cross-sectional multistage  was conducted with 286 in-school adolescents in Ibadan, Nigeria. Data were collected with questionnaires. The questionnaires evaluated socio-demography, mental health, and perceived   using the Strength and Difficulty Questionnaire (SDQ) and Scale of  Styles (SPS) questionnaires. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS 21. Results: Some of the adolescents in this , experienced peer problems (4.9%), conduct problems (9.4%), hyperactivity problems (0.7%), emotional problems (14.3%), and they lacked pro-social behaviours (11.1%). In comparison to adolescents who perceived fathers as authoritative, adolescents who perceived fathers as less demanding experienced emotional (p = 0.01) and peer (p = 0.02) problems. Perceived maternal negligence and authoritarian  was associated with more peer problems (1.5?2.3 and 1.3?2.2) in comparison to perceived maternal authoritative  (0.6?1.5). Most adolescents from lower social class experienced conduct (88.8%; p = 0.07) and emotional problems (73.2%; p = 0.20). Conclusion: Competent   and socio-economic resources supports resilience to mental health problems in adolescents."
The benefits of authoritative feeding style: caregiver feeding styles and 's food consumption patterns,2005,"This  tested the associations between caregiver feeding  and 's food consumption patterns among African-American (AA) and Hispanic (H) caregivers and their preschool . Participants were 231 caregivers (101 AA; 130 H) with  enrolled in Head Start. Caregivers completed questionnaires on authoritarian and authoritative feeding  (Caregiver's Feeding Styles Questionnaire; CFSQ) and various aspects of 's food consumption patterns (availability of, feeding attempts for, and 's consumption of dairy, fruit, and vegetables). Simultaneous multiple regression analyses tested the unique contribution of feeding  in predicting food consumption patterns. Authoritative feeding was positively associated whereas authoritarian feeding was negatively associated with the availability of fruit and vegetables. Authoritative feeding was  positively associated with attempts to get the  to eat dairy, fruit, and vegetables, and reported  consumption of dairy and vegetables. Authoritarian feeding was negatively associated with 's vegetable consumption. All  remained significant after controlling for 's gender and body mass index (BMI), and caregiver's ethnicity, BMI, and level of education. Overall,  provide evidence for the benefits of authoritative feeding and suggest that interventions to increase 's consumption of dairy, fruit, and vegetables should be targeted toward increasing caregivers' authoritative feeding behaviors.

"Cross-cultural adaptation, validity, and reliability of the Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire - Short Version (PSDQ) for use in Brazil",2018,"Objective: The  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ) is used worldwide to assess three  (authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive) and seven dimensions of . In this , we adapted the short version of the PSDQ for use in Brazil and investigated its validity and reliability. Methods: Participants were 451 mothers of  aged 3 to 18 years, though sample size varied with analyses. The translation and adaptation of the PSDQ followed a rigorous methodological approach. Then, we investigated the content, criterion, and construct validity of the adapted instrument. Results: The scale content validity index (S-CVI) was considered adequate (0.97). There was evidence of internal validity, with the PSDQ dimensions showing strong correlations with their higher-order  . Confirmatory factor analysis endorsed the three-factor, second-order solution (i.e., three  consisting of seven dimensions). The PSDQ showed convergent validity with the validated Brazilian version of the  Styles Inventory (Inventario de Estilos ais - IEP), as well as external validity, as it was associated with several instruments measuring sociodemographic and behavioral/emotional-problem variables. Conclusion: The PSDQ is an effective and reliable psychometric instrument to assess rearing strategies according to Baumrind's model of  ."

High effortful control and low dispositional anger/frustration uniquely predicted Chinese 's high social functioning, and the relation of anger/frustration to social functioning was moderated by effortful control. Authoritarian  was associated with 's low effortful control and high dispositional anger/frustration. which (especially effortful control) mediated the negative relation between authoritarian  and 's social functioning. Effortful control weakly mediated the positive relation of authoritative  to social functioning."
"Relationship of perceived parenting styles, locus of control orientation, and self-concept among junior high age students",1998,"Relationships between adolescents' perceptions of their s' responsiveness and demandingness, adolescents' locus of control orientation, and adolescents' self-concept ratings were investigated. Participants included 198 students in grades eight and nine who were administered the Nowicki-Strickland Internal-External Locus of Control Scale, the Harter Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents, and the Perceived  Styles Survey. Participants who perceived their s as being Authoritative had a significantly more internal locus of control orientation than subjects who perceived their s as either Permissive or Authoritarian. Self-Concept scores were significantly higher for the Authoritative group than for the Permissive or Authoritarian groups in several areas. The findings indicate that an Authoritative  of  may contribute to the development of self-adequacy by being associated with internal locus of control orientation and stronger self-concept, while Permissive and Authoritarian  of  may be associated with negative patterns of social-emotional development.

Authority and moral reasons: Parenting style and 's perceptions of adult rule justifications,2005,"The  of  of 100  ( mean age 11 years, 5 months) was established according to Baumrind's typology. Children were asked to indicate what they thought an adult would say to justify a moral rule in five different scenarios. Results indicated that   did not relate to the number of justifications that  thought adults would produce but did affect the types of justifications they thought adults would give. Children of authoritative s thought that adults would use more justifications based on reciprocity or equality in social relations than  of authoritarian s. The  suggest that  of authoritative s do not perceive adults to offer a more discursive moral atmosphere than  of other s do; rather these  are more likely than others to think that adults will justify moral rules specifically in terms of equality in social relations. An unexpected finding was that  of permissive s tended to judge that adults would legitimise judgments by pointing to the consequences of action for other people."
Employment and parenting among current and former welfare recipients,2006,"This two-wave longitudinal  investigated whether low-wage employment predicts improvements in depressive symptoms and   in a sample of 178 current and former single-mother welfare recipients with a preschooler at Time 1 and an early-elementary school-age  at Time 2. Findings suggest that participation in employment is associated with improvements in single mothers' psychological well-being and   over time. However, in this , employment at Time 1 (baseline) was more beneficial with respect to psychological and  outcomes than was employment (and earning more) at Time 2, except for mothers who were not employed at Time 1 and who became employed by Time 2. For these mothers, employment at Time 2 predicted a decrease in depressive symptoms and, through the latter, less negative  . Mothers with higher educational attainment were more likely to be employed at Time 1 (which predicted higher levels of employment and pay at Time 2) and, among those not employed at Time 1, more likely to become employed (and earn more) by Time 2. Implications of these findings for welfare reform are discussed."

Positive Caregiving Styles Attenuating Effects of Cumulative Trauma Among Youth Who Commit Sexual Crimes,,"Among youth who commit sexual crimes, hood trauma experiences have been linked to a host of outcomes including trauma symptom expression. Furthermore,  has begun assessing differential rates of cumulative adverse hood experiences (ACEs) between youth who commit sexual and non-sexual crimes. Yet, few studies have comparatively examined rates of cumulative traumatic events using more robust measures of adversity. There is scant  on outcomes associated cumulative trauma among youth who commit sexual crimes including linkages to trauma symptoms and how positive   (PCSs) can attenuate in this relationship. This  aims to compare cumulative trauma experiences between youth who commit sexual (n = 112) and non-sexual crimes (n = 224). Among youth who commit sexual crimes, we test how PCSs mitigate or moderate the effects of cumulative trauma on trauma symptoms. Results from independent samplest-tests revealed significant group differences on singular and cumulative traumatic experiences, and trauma symptomatology, where youth who commit sexual crimes had higher rates of all. Stepwise linear regressions revealed mitigating effects of maternal PCSs and tests of moderation revealed main and interaction effects, where intermediate positive maternal caregiving  for youth with higher cumulative trauma were associated with greater trauma symptomatology. Implications and limitations are discussed."
Mothers' and Fathers' Attachment Styles and Power-Assertive Control: Indirect Associations Through Parental Representations,,"Research on adults' self-reported attachment , investigated mostly in social and personality psychology, has rarely been bridged with  on , studied mostly in developmental psychology. We proposed that s' attachment insecurity (avoidance and anxiety) has an indirect association with their power-assertive control, mediated through their negative reations, or internal working models (IWM) of the . In 200 community families from a Midwestern state (mothers, fathers, and ), we collected multimethod, parallel data for mother- and father- relationships. When  were infants, s completed self-reports of their own attachment . When  were toddlers, we assessed s' IWMs of the  in an interview and observed al power-assertive control in structured, naturalistic discipline contexts in the laboratory. Mothers' avoidance showed a unique association with their IWM of their . Consequently, there was an indirect association from the mother's avoidance to negative IWM to power-assertive control. Mothers' anxiety was associated directly with more power-assertive control. Fathers' avoidance and anxiety were  associated with their IWMs, but there were no unique associations, and the impact on  was limited. Forging a rapprochement between social and personality  on adults' attachment and developmental  on , this work elucidates a potential mechanism of the intergenerational transmission of adaptive and maladaptive  in families."
Functions of parenting styles on patterns of general and serious delinquency trajectories: A mediated model of school climates and delinquent peer association,2021,"Introduction: This  partially tests Agnew's (2005, 2011) general theory of crime and delinquency, drawing out the differential roles of , constraints, and motivations when comparing general delinquency trajectories and serious delinquency trajectories. Methods: Using data from a 7-year follow-up  of 927 South Korean male adolescents, the  incorporates a group-based trajectory modeling to identify subgroups, each having a unique pattern of trajectories, respectively. Results: The models yielded 3 subgroups: Early onset & decreaser, Increaser & late peak, and Normative for general delinquency as well as Serious delinquent, Moderate delinquents, and Normative for serious delinquency. The  reveal that compared to Normative group,   were significant of both the Moderate and Serious delinquents groups for only serious delinquency even after controlling for constraints and motivations. The odds of belonging to both the Early-Onset & Decreaser and Increaser & Late Peak groups for general delinquency and the Moderate Delinquents group for serious delinquency were significantly higher for those who more frequently associated with delinquent peers. Depression was significant among members of the Early-Onset & Decreaser group, while school connectedness was significant among members of the Increaser & Late Peak group for general delinquency. There were no mediating role of constraints and motivations in the -delinquency prediction. Conclusions: Intervention programs aimed at improving  skills can be developed to decrease the likelihood of delinquency."
Walking the Tightrope: Parenting Advice in Essence Magazine,2014,"Analysis of popular  advice in the form of magazines provides insight into culturally held views of what it means to be a good. Although  has examined  advice in popular magazines, the target readership has been largely comprised of White, middle-class mothers.

Adolescents (n = 242, M age 15.4 years, 49% male) who were enrolled in a drivers' education courses and their s (n = 276, 70% mothers) completed questionnaires reporting pre-driving   and monitoring behaviors; the adolescents' previous driving experiences; perceptions of risks for novice adolescent drivers; attitudes regarding al involvement; and expected levels of limit-setting and autonomy attainment once adolescents begins driving. s' and adolescents' involvement attitudes and expectations for limits on driving and autonomy attainment were linked in multivariate models with established patterns of  and perceptions of risk. The discussion emphasizes implications for prevention and intervention efforts to increase al involvement and limits. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Does General Parenting Context Modify Adolescents' Appraisals and Coping with a Situation of Parental Regulation? The Case of Autonomy-Supportive Parenting,2017,"Theory and  suggest that adolescents differ in their appraisals and coping reactions in response to al regulation. Less is known, however, about factors that determine these differences in adolescents' responses. In this , we examined whether adolescents' appraisals and coping reactions depend upon s' situation-specific autonomy-supportive or controlling communication  (i.e., the situation) in interaction with adolescents' past experiences with general autonomy-supportive  (i.e., the  context). Whereas in Study 1 (N = 176) adolescents' perceived general autonomy-supportive  context was assessed at one point in time, in Study 2 (N = 126) it was assessed multiple times across a 6-year period, allowing for an estimation of trajectories of perceived autonomy-supportive  context. In each , adolescents read a vignette-based scenario depicting a situation of maternal regulation (i.e., a request to  more), which was communicated in either an autonomy-supportive or a controlling way. Following this scenario, they reported upon their appraisals and their anticipated coping reactions. Results of each  indicated that both the autonomy-supportive (relative to the controlling) situation and the perceived autonomy-supportive  context generally related to more positive appraisals (i.e., more autonomy need satisfaction, less autonomy need frustration), as well as to more constructive coping responses (i.e., less oppositional defiance and submission, more negotiation and accommodation). In addition, situation x context interactions were found, whereby adolescents growing up in a more autonomy-supportive context seemed to derive greater benefits from the exposure to an autonomy-supportive situation and reacted more constructively to a controlling situation."
Applying Baumrind's parenting typology to high schools: toward a middle-range theory of authoritative socialization,2005,"I provide support for a middle-range theory of socialization  by applying Baumrind's typology of  (authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and indifferent) to high schools as socializing agents. In the family literature, findings show that the authoritative  (both responsive and demanding) produces the best  on  behavioral outcomes, and the indifferent  the worst . The school climate literature suggests that schools that are both responsive and demanding achieve the best  with students. Using data from the High School Effectiveness Study, I test the effect of school  on student disengagement-truancy and dropout. My  indicate that school  produce outcomes similar to  : authoritative schools have the best  and indifferent schools the worst  for disengagement, while authoritarian schools have the worst  for dropout.

Supporting Positive Parenting and Promoting Healthy Living through Family Cooking Classes,2021,"Background: The family is an important setting in the promotion of  health. The - relationship affects the social and health development of , and 's healthy behaviors are associated with positive  strategies. The - relationship is bi-directional and the connection between  and  health is complex. However, few  interventions work with s and  together, and more knowledge is needed on how to develop and implement interventions promoting healthy - relationships. Focusing on a family cooking class program, this  addresses how community initiatives engaging s and  together can contribute to integrating  support with local health promotion. Methods: Participant-driven photo-elicited interviews (nine families), focus group evaluations (nine s/14 ) and observations during cooking classes (10 classes) were applied to analyze the tools and mechanisms that can support positive . Results: The  found that visual, practical and sensory learning techniques, applied in a context-sensitive learning environment that ensured guidance, safety and a friendly social atmosphere, contributed to positive - interaction and bonding. Conclusion: The cooking program facilitated  practices that support  involvement and autonomy. Thus, the program constituted an effective intervention to strengthen - relationships and positive ."
"Anxiety Sensitivity: An Examination of the Relationship With Authoritarian, Authoritative, and Permissive Parental Styles",2015,"A substantial literature has investigated the role of  on a 's development. Several classifications of   (i. e., permissive, authoritarian, authoritative) have been linked to a wide range of negative outcomes such as mood and anxiety problems; however, their respective associations to anxiety sensitivity (AS) remain unclear. Using a nonclinical sample of young adults (N 5 227), this  is the first to empirically investigate whether   were differentially associated with AS, controlling for general depression and anxiety symptoms. Hierarchical linear regression analyses showed that authoritarian and permissive  were associated with elevated AS. Permissive  was associated with the AS physical subfactor, whereas authoritarian  was associated with the AS social subfactor. Moreover, AS was found to mediate the relationship between specific al  and anxiety symptoms as well as depressive symptoms. Findings suggest that AS may mediate the relationship between   and negative psychological outcomes."
"Alcohol use, mental health, and parenting practices among HIV-positive mothers",2019,"Mothers living with HIV (MLH) must balance care, their illness, and oftentimes other mental health problems/stressors. It is important to understand how a maladaptive coping strategy (alcohol use), is linked to poorer  practices. We assessed the relationship between mental health/coping (anxiety, depression, alcohol use, social support), and /family dimensions (communication,  /stress, family routines/cohesion) among 152 MLH. Mothers reporting more psychiatric symptoms and less social support  reported poorer  practices and interactions. Further, MLH who used more alcohol reported less  involvement and fewer family interactions. Alcohol use, even at subclinical levels, can negatively impact the - relationship."
Using an Evidence-Based Parenting Intervention with African American Parents,2015,"There has been a rise over the past several years in behavior problems among preschoolers. Young  who exhibit disruptive behavior are at increased risk of problematic outcomes later in life. Children from racial or ethnic minority groups and/or disadvantaged backgrounds may be at greater risk for behavioral problems. Therefore, interventions are needed before these behaviors become more entrenched. s of  with disruptive behaviors have reported higher  stress levels, which has a negative effect on  behaviors. Three models of   and behaviors are discussed, with a focus on the literature on African American  . To contribute to the literature addressing  training programs with African American populations, a case is ed as an example of the usefulness of an evidence-based behavioral family intervention with a low-income African American single  family. Treatment recommendations are ed when applying evidence-based  programs with African American and other racial or ethnic minority groups."
Exploring parenting practices of Guyanese parents based on their upbringing: the connections to their 's wayward and wandering behaviors,2019,"Effective  experiences of individuals during the hood years within micro-ecological environments are pivotal to cultivating good  practices in later adulthood. This  explored the  practices based on upbringing and the connections these practices had on 's proclivity to wayward and wandering behaviours. The  employed a qualitative exploratory design through a phenomenological approach. It utilized semi-structured interviews to gather data from 10 Guyanese s of juveniles who had wandered away from home or reported as wayward to the social services in Guyana. The findings suggest that authoritarian   is predominant among this cohort of s. However, a combined authoritarian and permissive  materialized as an unanticipated outcome. Lack of knowledge of  developmental stages and computer illiteracy emerged as key themes which have implications for appropriate  interventions. The findings offer credibility to a strong link between ineffective  practices and negative juvenile behavioural outcomes."
"The longitudinal relations among dimensions of parenting styles, sympathy, prosocial moral reasoning, and prosocial behaviors",2011,"Developmental scholars assert that s are important in fostering prosocial behaviors in adolescents, but longitudinal investigations on this topic are limited. Participants consisted of 372 boys and 358 girls with a mean age of 10.84 years (SD = 1.57) at Wave 1 from a mostly middle class community in Spain. Across three successive years, participants completed measures of fathers' and mothers' warmth and strict control, sympathy, prosocial moral reasoning, and self-and peer-reported prosocial behaviors. Results showed that al warmth, sympathy, and prosocial moral reasoning were predictive of prosocial behaviors. Further analyses showed bidirectional effects such that early prosocial behaviors predicted later  and adolescents' prosociality. Findings lend support to cognitive-developmental and moral internalization models of prosocial development."

"Uptake of HPV vaccine: Demographics, sexual history and values, parenting style, and vaccine attitudes",2008,"Purpose: To examine the relationships of demographics, , and vaccine attitudes with the acceptance Of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine or to the intent to vaccinate in the next 12 months. Methods: Mothers (n = 153) with daughters ages 11 to 17 years were recruited through the pediatric clinic waiting room/announcements to complete a questionnaire. Results: Eighteen percent of the daughters had not received the vaccine, although it had been offered: 34% had not been offered the vaccine and did not intend to get it in the next 12 months: 22% had not been offered the vaccine but intended to get it in the next 12 months: 26% had started vaccination or completed the Series. In a multinomial, multivariable logistic regression model. those mothers who had less than a high school degree, had a history of a sexually transmitted infection, supervised their daughter more when she was with peers, and whose daughter would not mind three shots were more likely to be favorable about their daughter being vaccinated. The following variables were not related to their attitudes about getting the vaccine: mothers' and daughters' ages, race/ethnicity, mothers self-reported history of HPV disease and age sexual initiation, daughters, dating status and anticipated age of sexual initiation, the number of sexual topics discussed and level of comfort. mother's sexual values, and the family environment. Conclusions: Mothers' decisions about the HPV vaccine were not related to their sexual values or their daughters' sexual behaviour but rather their , sense of vulnerability, and vaccine attitudes. Mothers who were not planning to vaccinate did not appear to not feel in urgency given the newness of the vaccine, and many planned to vaccinate eventually. (c) 2008 Society for Adolescent Medicine.

"Relations among maternal parenting style, academic competence, and life satisfaction in Chinese early adolescents",2004,"The relations among maternal concern and restrictiveness, self-evaluated academic competence, and life satisfaction were explored in a short-term longitudinal  of 346 7th-grade students (126 males and 220 females) in Hong Kong. The authors found that perceived maternal concern, academic competence, and life satisfaction significantly declined from the beginning to the end of the 7th grade. Mothers viewed themselves as higher in al concern than adolescents viewed them. Structural equation modeling found that adolescents' perceived maternal concerns and academic competences significantly predicted life satisfaction over time, whereas perceived maternal restrictiveness did not. The data support the importance of perceived maternal concern and academic competence in predicting early adolescent life satisfaction."

This  examined whether the effect of 's genotype, specifically 5-HTTLPR, on mothers'  behaviors was moderated by her own  experiences from her mother. Two independent samples of three-year-olds (N=476 and 405) were genotyped for the serotonin transporter gene, and observational measures of  were collected. Mothers completed measures of the  they received as . The  having a short allele on 5-HTTLPR was associated with more maternal hostility (Samples 1 and 2) and with less maternal support (Sample 1), but only if the mother reported lower quality grandmothers'  (abuse and indifference in Sample 1 and lower levels of grandmother care in Sample 2).

"Maladaptive Parenting, Temperament, Early Maladaptive Schemas, and Depression: A Moderated Mediation Analysis",2017,"According to the Schema Therapy Model, maladaptive   interact with a 's unique temperament in the development of early maladaptive schemas (EMSs), which in turn increase one's risk for developing pathology. However, few authors have examined the comprehensive model. The purpose of this  was to assess the indirect effect of perceived   on depressive symptoms through EMSs. Furthermore, a series of moderated mediation analyses were conducted to examine whether the indirect effect varies as a function of temperament. A total of 403 undergraduate students completed measures of perceived  experiences, temperament, EMSs, and depressive symptoms. Results indicated that the schema domains of disconnection/rejection and impaired autonomy mediated the relationship between perceived   and depressive symptoms. Moderation of the indirect effect was only found in two of the twelve tested models. This  lends partial support to the Schema Therapy model and  offers a new way of looking at the interactive nature of the constructs."
Parenting and Cyberbullying Across Adolescence,2018,"Cyberbullying perpetration continues to be a prevalent and harmful phenomenon. Despite the recent wealth of studies that examine cyberbullying frequency, further  is needed to investigate protective factors or variables that decrease the likelihood of engaging in cyberbullying perpetration. Past work has identified certain types of  as a potential protective factor against adolescent cyberbullying perpetration; however, there is a paucity of  testing these relations over time. This  explores  during early adolescence as predicting attitudes and behaviors associated with cyberbullying in late adolescence. Data were derived from the Flourishing Families Project (FFP) at Wave 2 (M age = 12) and Wave 9 (M age = 19). Results suggest that the authoritative  pecifically the warmth and support dimensionwas associated with less supportive attitudes toward cyberbullying and lower levels of cyberbullying in emerging adulthood. Moreover, particularly for boys, authoritarian  behaviors served as a risk factor for cyberbullying engagement. Suggestions are offered to advocate for greater positive  education during early adolescence as a potential protective factor against cyberbullying."
Parental Socialization Styles: The Contribution of Paternal and Maternal Affect/Communication and Strictness to Family Socialization Style,2019,"The aim of this  is two-fold: (a) to determine the general degree of family affect/communication and strictness by examining the combination of the two classical dimensions of mother  : affect/communication and strictness, and (b) to analyze the impact of both s' affect and strictness on the family , thereby exploring the specific contribution made by each 's  and dimension.

The aim of this  was to examine whether the relationship between eating and behaviour problems could be explained in part by   and practices. Methods Seventy-seven mothers of 3- to 8-year-old  completed measures of 's eating behaviours, behaviour problems,   and feeding practices. Results Eating behaviours (food responsiveness, emotional under-eating, fussiness) and behaviour problems (conduct problems, hyperactivity, total difficulties) were significantly correlated, but when   and feeding practices were controlled for, significant associations disappeared. Conclusions Although the findings are limited because of a relatively low response rate, in non-clinical groups, the perceived commonality between eating and behaviour problems may be explained by ."
"Parental Sedentary Restriction, Maternal Parenting Style, and Television Viewing Among 10-to 11-Year-Olds",2011,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether   or practices were associated with 's television (TV) viewing. METHODS: A total of 431 - dyads (10- to 11-year-old ) from Bristol, United Kingdom, were included. Child and  TV viewing were self-reported and categorized as <2, 2 to 4, or >4 hours/day. Children reported maternal   (authoritarian, authoritative, or permissive). Child-reported maternal and paternal sedentary restriction scores were combined to create a family-level restriction score. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine whether  TV viewing was predicted by   or family restriction. RESULTS: A greater proportion of  with permissive mothers watched >4 hours of TV per day, compared with  with authoritarian or authoritative mothers (P = .033). A greater proportion of  for whom both s demonstrated high restriction watched <2 hours of TV per day (P < .001). The risk of watching 2 to 4 hours (vs <2 hours) of TV per day was 2.2 times higher for  from low-restriction families (P = .010). The risk of watching >4 hours (vs <2 hours) of TV per day was 3.3 times higher for  from low-restriction families (P = .013). The risk of watching >4 hours of TV per day was 5.2 times higher for  with permissive (versus authoritative) mothers (P = .010).

The effects of parenting on early adolescents' noncognitive skills: Evidence from a sample of twins in Germany,,"Many theories in the social sciences assume that  affects  development. Previous  mostly supports the notion that  affects the skill development of  in early hood. There are fewer studies testing whether  in early adolescence has such an influence. We estimate the effects of  on early adolescents' noncognitive skills using data from the German Twin Family Panel (TwinLife). Specifically, we look at the effects of  , al activities, and extracurricular activities on the academic self-concept, motivation, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and locus of control of 10 to 14 years old . To control for unobserved heterogeneity and reverse causality, we employ twin fixed-effects models combined with longitudinal information. In addition, MZ twin fixed effects models  control for genetic confounding. Our findings provide no support to the notion that  , al activities, and extracurricular activities in early adolescence affect the development of 's noncognitive skills. We conclude that our , in combination with the majority of evidence from previous , are in line with a model according to which  has larger effects on the skill development of  in early hood than in early adolescence."
Imposter phenomenon and self-handicapping: Links with parenting styles and self-confidence,2006,"This  examined al rearing  and objective confidence in relation to impostor phenomenon (feelings of phoniness experienced by individuals who have achieved some level of success, Clance & Imes., 1978) and self-handicapping tendencies (creation of an impediment to performance as an excuse for possible failure, Jones & Berglas, 1978). Participants (N = 115) completed measures of impostorism, self-handicapping, al bonding (for each ) and Esoteric Analogies test with confidence judgments. Impostor feelings were predicted by paternal overprotection and lack of Paternal care. Self-handicapping scores were predicted by lack of maternal care. A significant relationship was found between impostorism and self-handicapping. Supporting the nature of the impostor phenomenon, impostors showed a gap between assessment of their performance and actual task-related achievements. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The reproduction of educational inequalities - do parenting and  behavioural problems matter?,2019,"The strong link between al socioeconomic status (SES) and 's success in school is well established. However, mechanisms that underpin this association remain a major issue in current  on social inequality. Using data from the Families in Germany Study and structural equation modelling, this  demonstrates that   and  behavioural problems explain, in part, the association between al SES and  school grades for mathematics and German between the ages of 9 and 10. We found that s with a low SES are more likely to be inconsistent in their  and to use psychological control with their  more often, these two factors being linked to  behavioural problems. Adverse  and behavioural problems are, in turn, associated with low school grades. Our findings  show that behavioural problems in  are associated with lower school grades independent of  . These findings suggest that   and  behavioural problems and their interplay may be potential pathways that underpin the influence of al SES on 's school achievement."

Does parenting style moderate the relationship between parent-youth sexual risk communication and premarital sexual debut among in-school youth in Eswatini?,2021,"Background Based on propositions of the contextual model of  , we examined whether there is a relationship between -youth sexual risk communication (PYSRC) and premarital sexual debut, and whether this relationship is moderated by the  . Methods A cross-sectional  design was employed, and data were collected using a self-reported questionnaire from 462 youth (211 boys and 251 girls) aged 15-24 years in senior grades of three public high schools (two rural and one urban) in Eswatini (formerly Swaziland). A hierarchical binary regression analysis was conducted to examine the association between PYSRC and premarital sexual debut, and to test whether   moderates this relationship. Results The mean age of participants was 18.9 (+/- 1.85) years, and a slight majority were females (54.3%). About 35.9% of participants reported having had sex (i.e., premarital sexual debut). After adjusting for age, gender, living arrangement, school location, and peer sexual activity, neither PYSRC (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00, 1.03) nor   (AOR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.64, 1.04) significantly predicted premarital sexual debut in the sample.

Conclusion Contrary to propositions of the contextual model of  , in this ,   (authoritativeness) did not moderate the studied relationship, indicating the need for more studies to test the applicability of the contextual model of   in African settings."
"Psychological separation and adjustment to university: Moderating effects of gender, age, and perceived parenting style",2003,"Examined in this article is the association between psychological separation and adjustment to university in a sample of 969 late adolescents. Structural equations modeling confirmed the existence of two dimensions of psychological separation, namely independence from s and positive separation feelings. Results indicated that both dimensions of psychological separation positively predicted better adjustment to university, but that positive separation feelings clearly were the better predictor None of these associations was moderated by students' grade level or gender or by their s' perceived  . In the total sample, independence from s was associated with lower levels of positive separation feelings. This association was, however moderated by students' grade, gender and s' perceived  . The negative relationship between the two dimensions of psychological separation only held for fresh-men and junior students, females, and students reared by authoritarian s. Implications of these findings for current understanding of the separation-adjustment link and for counseling college students are discussed."
"Authority, disciplinary intimacy & parenting in middle-class America",2017,"Children learn about authority first from their s. A shift in orientation to authority occurred during middle-class formation in the mid-nineteenth century U.S., a  of  described as disciplinary intimacy.' A century later disciplinary intimacy, or -centered'  characterized rearing advice across American society. Simultaneously, distrust of all institutions in the liberal democratic state accelerated, causing questioning and confusion at every level of society. In family life, disciplinary practices once considered necessary, such as corporal punishment, came to be regarded as harsh and responsible for authoritarianism. Child-centered , while discouraging restrictive' rearing practices, gave little direction about constructive correctives, which fueled al anxiety even as developmentalists temporarily resolved the decades-long controversy about restrictive vs. permissive' . By the 1990s a debate formerly contrasting working- and middle-class rearing values was overshadowed by a second shift focused on 's school success as earlier considerations of authority and discipline faded from view. As concern spreads about the rise of authoritarianism across the West, the politics of  may once again preoccupy social scientists who worry about the nascence of sectarianism, xenophobia, and bellicose nationalism."
"Bullying Perpetration and Victimization as Externalizing and Internalizing Pathways: A Retrospective Study Linking Parenting Styles and Self-Esteem to Depression, Alcohol Use, and Alcohol-Related Problems",2016,"Background: Emerging  suggests significant positive associations between bullying and substance use behaviors. However, these studies typically focused either on the link between substance use and bullying perpetration or victimization, and few have conceptualized bullying perpetration and/or victimization as mediators. Objective: In this , we simultaneously tested past bullying perpetration and victimization as mediational pathways from retrospective report of   and global self-esteem to current depressive symptoms, alcohol use, and alcohol-related problems. Methods: Data were collected from a college sample of 419 drinkers. Mediation effects were conducted using a bias-corrected bootstrap technique within a structural equation modeling framework. Results: Two-path mediation analyses indicated that mother and father authoritativeness were protective against bully victimization and depression through higher self-esteem. Conversely, having a permissive or authoritarian mother was positively linked to bullying perpetration, which in turn, was associated with increased alcohol use, and to a lesser degree, more alcohol-related problems. Mother authoritarianism was associated with alcohol-related problems through depressive symptoms. Three-path mediation analyses suggested a trend in which individuals with higher self-esteem were less likely to report alcohol-related problems through lower levels of bullying victimization and depression. Conclusions/Importance: Results suggested that bullying perpetration and victimization may, respectively, serve as externalizing and internalizing pathways through which   and self-esteem are linked to depression and alcohol-related outcomes. The   identified multiple modifiable precursors of, and mediational pathways to, alcohol-related problems which could guide the development and implementation of prevention programs targeting problematic alcohol use."
Differential parenting and risk for psychopathology: a monozygotic twin difference approach,2015,"Consistent and non-specific associations have been found between   and major depression, anxiety disorders, and externalizing behavior. Although often considered part of twins' shared environment,  can  be conceptualized as non-shared environment. Non-shared environmental influences have important effects on development but are difficult to test and sort out because of the possible confounding effects of gene-environment interactions and evocative gene-environment correlations. The monozygotic (MZ) differences approach is one way to analytically investigate non-shared environment. The aim of the   is to use the MZ differences approach to investigate the relationship between differential  among 1303 twin pairs (mean age 36.69 +/- A 8.56) and differences in total symptom counts of major depression (MD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), conduct disorder (CD), and anti-social behavior (ASB) during adulthood. Although effect sizes tended to be small, a number of  were significantly different from zero. Perceived differences in al coldness was positively associated with internalizing disorders. Differences in protectiveness were negatively associated with MD, GAD, and ASB. Differences in authoritarianism were positively associated with MD and CD, but negatively associated with ASB. Perceived differences in   are associated with differences in MD, GAD, CD, and ASB outcomes in a sample of MZ twins. Despite the lack of a basis for making causal inferences about   and psychopathology, these  are suggestive of such a relationship and show that non-shared environmental influence of  does in some cases significantly predict adult psychopathology."
"Parenting Style, the Home Environment, and Screen Time of 5-Year-Old Children; The 'Be Active, Eat Right' Study",2014,"Introduction: The global increase in hood overweight and obesity has been ascribed partly to increases in 's screen time. s have a large influence on their 's screen time. Studies investigating  and early hood screen time are limited. In this , we investigated associations of   and the social and physical home environment on watching TV and using computers or game consoles among 5-year-old . Methods: This  uses baseline data concerning 5-year-old  (n = 3067) collected for the 'Be active, eat right' . Results: Children of s with a higher score on the   dimension involvement, were more likely to spend >30 min/day on computers or game consoles. Overall, families with an authoritative or authoritarian   had lower percentages of 's screen time compared to families with an indulgent or neglectful , but no significant difference in OR was found. In families with rules about screen time,  were less likely to watch TV>2 hrs/day and more likely to spend >30 min/day on computers or game consoles. The number of TVs and computers or game consoles in the household was positively associated with screen time, and  with a TV or computer or game console in their bedroom were more likely to watch TV>2 hrs/day or spend >30 min/day on computers or game consoles. Conclusion: The magnitude of the association between   and screen time of 5-year-olds was found to be relatively modest. The associations found between the social and physical environment and 's screen time are independent of  . Interventions to reduce 's screen time might be most effective when they support s specifically with introducing family rules related to screen time and prevent the presence of a TV or computer or game console in the 's room."
The relationship of parenting styles to commitment to the Church among young adults,2000,"A survey of 653 Seventh-day Adventist young adults, randomly distributed throughout the United States and Canada, compared their perceptions of the way their s treated them as  with their  commitment to the church. Warm, caring behaviours from s predicted strong religious commitment when the  entered adulthood. In the case of the mother it  predicted regularity in worship attendance. Of the four  of , affectionate constraint, a mixture of care and control, produced the largest percentage of enthusiastic members and the fewest dropouts."
Parenting in Emerging Adulthood: An Examination of Parenting Clusters and Correlates,2011,"The changing nature of the transition to adulthood in western societies, such as the United States, may be extending the length of time s are engaged in  activities. However, little is known about different approaches s take in their interactions with their emerging-adult . Hence, this  attempted to identify different clusters of s based on the extent to which they exhibited both extremes of control (psychological control, punishment, verbal hostility, indulgence) and responsiveness (knowledge, warmth, induction, autonomy granting), and to examine how combinations of  were related to emerging adult 's relational and individual outcomes (e.g. - relationship quality, drinking, self-worth, depression). The data were collected from 403 emerging adults (M age = 19.89, SD = 1.78, range = 18-26, 62% female) and at least one of their s (287 fathers and 317 mothers). Eighty-four percent of participants reported being European American, 6% Asian American, 4% African American, 3% Latino, and 4% reported being of other ethnicities. Data were analyzed using hierarchical cluster analysis, separately for mothers and fathers, and identified three similar clusters of s which we labeled as uninvolved (low on all aspects of ), controlling-indulgent (high on both extremes of control and low on all aspects of responsiveness), and authoritative (high on responsiveness and low on control). A fourth cluster was identified for both mothers and fathers and was labeled as inconsistent for mothers (mothers were above the mean on both extremes of control and on responsiveness) and average for fathers (fathers were at the mean on all eight aspects of ). The discussion focuses on how each of these clusters effectively distinguished between  outcomes."
Human evolution and culture in relationship to shame in the parenting role: Implications for psychology and psychotherapy,2019,"Objectives There is considerable evidence that early  has profound effects on a range of physiological and psychological maturation processes. Furthermore, psychotherapy often addresses some of the distortions and developmental difficulties that have arisen from early hood. While  has focused on obvious candidates such as abuse and neglect, this paper reviews some of the core themes related to a less investigated area, specifically al shame on  development. Role shame sensitive   will be explored against an evolutionary background that contrasts early human and modern human rearing contexts. We  outline a  examining the role of shame in psychological controlling and dysfunctional  , its relationship to different dimensions of shame and fears of compassion. Design An online survey was conducted containing self-report measures of dysfunctional  , three dimensions of shame (external, internal, and reflected), fears of compassion, mental health indices, and a measure of psychological flexibility. Methods An online survey was accessed by 333 s (306 being female) with a  between the ages of 3-9 years. Results Two hierarchical multiple regressions indicated support for our two primary hypotheses, with shame explaining significant variance in both psychological controlling and dysfunctional   over and above that explained by psychological inflexibility, al mental health, and fears of compassion. Additionally,  from standard multiple regressions indicated that fears of compassion account for significant variance in external shame, as well as internal and reflected shame. Conclusions Recommendations for future  include focusing on al motivation in order to help support s and  are provided. Practitioner points Shame is a major factor for how s engage in  practices and respond to their  Practitioners need to be sensitive to the shame s can experience and asses for it Assessing shame-threat in  and shifting to compassionate motivation can lead to more responsive and positive "
"Parenting Practices, Life Satisfaction, and the Role of Self-Esteem in Adolescents",2019,"Introduction: Studies have shown significant associations between  practices, life satisfaction, and self-esteem, and the role of  practices in adolescent adjustment, emphasizing its influence on wellbeing. Objectives: To analyze the relationships between  practices, self-esteem, and life satisfaction, and test the mediating effect of self-esteem on the relationship between the different  practices and life satisfaction of adolescents. Method: The sample came to a total of 742 adolescents, with an average age of 15.63 (SD = 1.24; range 13-19). The  Style Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and the Satisfaction with Life Scale were used. Results: Perception by adolescents of high levels of affect and communication, self-disclosure, and a sense of humor related to their s, as well as low levels of psychological control, explained the life satisfaction of the adolescents. Self-esteem exerted a partial mediating effect on the relationship between  practices and satisfaction with the life of the adolescent. Finally, self-esteem  appeared to be a moderator variable, specifically in the effect of self-disclosure on the life satisfaction of the adolescent. Conclusions: The  reinforce the role of personal variables, especially self-esteem, in - interaction and in the improved subjective wellbeing of the adolescent."
The influence of parenting on maladaptive cognitive schema: a cross-sectional  on a group of adults,2017,"Background: The literature emphasizes the role of early interpersonal experiences in the development of cognitive vulnerability; in particular, interruptions in early family relationships, al unavailability and dysfunctional  are potential evolutionary precursors to negative cognitive  and emotional disorders. Materials and methods: This  measured the relationship of retrospective ratings on al bonding with cognitive patterns in a group of Italian adults. The objectives of this  were as follows: to analyze the influence of age and education level on cognitive domains; to verify whether being s and living at home with s affect both   and cognitive domains; to investigate how the type of the maternal and paternal  independently affects cognitive ; to measure the predictive variables for the use of cognitive dysfunctional patterns and to investigate age as a moderating variable of the relation between   and cognitive domains in a group of adult men and women. The  involved 209 adults (118 males and 91 females) living in Sicily (Italy) aged between 20 and 60 years (M = 37.52; SD = 11.42). The  lasted for 1 year. The instruments used were the al Bonding Instrument to measure the perception of  during hood and the Young Schema Questionnaire-3 to investigate cognitive patterns. Results: Data show that being a younger adult male with mother's   characterized by a lower level of nurturance is predictive of the disconnection and rejection domain, whereas, being a younger adult woman, with a higher level of maternal control is predictive of the impaired limits domain. Conclusion: This  underlines that because mothers and fathers establish different bonds with their , care and control by both s might impact different domains of development."
Food parenting practices for 5 to 12 year old : a concept map analysis of parenting and nutrition experts input,2017,"Background: s are an important influence on 's dietary intake and eating behaviors. However, the lack of a conceptual framework and inconsistent assessment of food  practices limits our understanding of which food  practices are most influential on . The aim of this  was to develop a food  practice conceptual framework using systematic approaches of literature reviews and expert input. Method: A previously completed systematic review of food  practice instruments and a qualitative  of s informed the development of a food  practice item bank consisting of 3632 food  practice items. The original item bank was further reduced to 110 key food  concepts using binning and winnowing techniques. A panel of 32 experts in  and nutrition were invited to sort the food  practice concepts into categories that reflected their perceptions of a food  practice conceptual framework. Multi-dimensional scaling produced a point map of the sorted concepts and hierarchical cluster analysis identified potential solutions. Subjective modifications were used to identify two potential solutions, with additional feedback from the expert panel requested. Results: The experts came from 8 countries and 25 participated in the sorting and 23 provided additional feedback. A parsimonious and a comprehensive concept map were developed based on the clustering of the food  practice constructs. The parsimonious concept map contained 7 constructs, while the comprehensive concept map contained 17 constructs and was informed by a previously published content map for food  practices. Most of the experts (52%) preferred the comprehensive concept map, while 35% preferred to  both solutions. Conclusion: The comprehensive food  practice conceptual map will provide the basis for developing a calibrated Item Response Modeling (IRM) item bank that can be used with computerized adaptive testing. Such an item bank will allow for more consistency in measuring food  practices across studies to better assess the impact of food  practices on  outcomes and the effect of interventions that target s as agents of change."
Autism spectrum disorder traits in typically developing emerging adults and associated parenting: A person-centered approach,2018,"Research on   with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) indicates these  receive  tailored to their condition. However, little is known about ASD in adulthood, especially in emerging adults at college, and how they are ed. The current  examined how emerging adults in a non-clinical typically-developing sample differed in their current perceptions of  as a function of ASD traits. Participants completed questionnaires about their current perceptions of  and self-reported ASD traits.  characteristics assessed included  , discipline, - relationship quality, and al distress. Results indicated that higher levels of self-reported ASD traits were associated with increasingly ineffective  characteristics including lower authoritative , harsher discipline, poorer - relationship quality (e.g., lower involvement), and higher al distress. Researchers are encouraged to extend ASD  into adulthood by validating diagnostic methods with adults and investigating processes in adulthood that have been well-established in the hood ASD literature."
"Adult attachment, parenting experiences, and core beliefs about self and others",2008,"The aim of this  was to examine whether reports of al care-giving and attachment reations were associated with the self- and other-evaluative core beliefs that are implicated in cognitive models of psychopathology. Undergraduate students (n = 389; 283 [73%] female; mean age 21.9 years, s.d. 5.25) completed questionnaire measures of attachment, self- and other-evaluative core beliefs, al caregiving , and negative affect. As hypothesised, with negative affect controlled for, negative self-evaluative core beliefs were correlated with anxious attachment (r(s) =.397, p < .001) and with inconsistent or ambivalent maternal care-giving, but the latter effect was confined to females (r(s) =.303, p < .001). Correlations between negative other-evaluative core beliefs, avoidant attachment and cold and rejecting  were rendered non-significant when negative affect was controlled for (r(s) = .085 and r(s) = .072, respectively). Warm and responsive  was correlated with positive self- and other-evaluative core beliefs. Our findings are consistent with a role for  experiences and attachment reations in the development of negative self-evaluative core beliefs, but not negative other-evaluative core beliefs. These findings may both inform our understanding of psychopathology and have implications for therapeutic relationships. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
The influence of Parenting change on pediatric weight control,2005,"Objective:   was examined as a predictor of weight loss maintenance in behavioral family-based pediatric obesity treatment. Research Methods and Procedures: Fifty obese  who participated in a behavioral family-based pediatric obesity treatment were studied. Hierarchical regression tested the incremental effect of baseline  and  during treatment on 's percentage overweight change over 12 months, beyond demographics and adherence to targeted behaviors. Results: Children's percentage overweight significantly decreased at 6 (-16.3) and 12 (-11.1) months. Adherence to program goals significantly increased variance accounted for in the regression model by 10.8%, whereas adding baseline father acceptance and change in father acceptance accounted for another 20.5%. The overall model accounted for 40.6% of the variance in pediatric weight control. ANOVA showed significantly greater percentage overweight decrease from baseline for youth with fathers who increased their acceptance vs. those who decreased acceptance at 6 (-19.8 vs. -14.6) and 12 (-17.4 vs. -8.1) months. Discussion: Youth who perceive an increase in father acceptance after treatment had better changes in percentage overweight over 12 months than youth with lower ratings of father acceptance. Future directions include examining how other  dimensions impact pediatric obesity treatment outcome and how al acceptance can be enhanced to improve  weight control."

"Parental psychopathology, parenting styles, and the risk of social phobia in offspring - A prospective-longitudinal community study",2000,"Background: This article examines the associations between DSM-IV social phobia and al psychopathology,  , and characteristics of family functioning in a reative community sample of adolescents. Methods: Findings are based on baseline and first follow-up data of 1047 adolescents aged 14 to 17 years at baseline (response rate, 74.3%), and independent diagnostic interviews with one of their s. Diagnostic assessments in s and adolescents were based on the DSM-IV algorithms of the Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview.   (rejection, emotional warmth, and overprotection) was assessed by the Questionnaire of Recalled al Rearing Behavior, and family functioning (problem solving, communication, roles, affective responsiveness, affective involvement, and behavioral control) was assessed by the McMaster Family Assessment Device. Results: There was a strong association between al social phobia and social phobia among offspring (odds ratio [OR],4.7; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 1.6-13.5). Other forms of al psychopathology  were associated with social phobia in adolescents (depression: OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.3-9.1; any anxiety disorder other than social phobia: OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.4-8.8; and any alcohol use disorder: OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.1 7.8).  , specifically al overprotection (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.9) and rejection (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9), was found to be associated with social phobia in respondents. Family functioning was not associated with respondents' social phobia. Conclusions: Data suggest that al psychopathology, particularly social phobia and depression, and perceived   (overprotection and rejection) are both associated with the development of social phobia in youth."
"Punishing 'Poor Parents': 'Respect', 'Responsibility' and Parenting Orders in Scotland",2007,"This article critiques the rise of  orders in Scotland within New Labour's self-d model of 'respect' and 'responsibility'. It examines the emergence of  orders in Scotland, which became available in April 2005, and argues that Scottish local authorities are sceptical of an approach they perceive as an ideological and legislative mix premised on punitive notions of individual responsibility and justice."
Cultural Variations in Mothers' Acceptance of and Intent to Use Behavioral Child Management Techniques,2012,"We examined cultural differences in mothers' acceptance of and intent to use behavioral  techniques for managing disruptive  behavior, and the possible roles of   and implicit theories in explaining these cultural differences. A community sample of 117 Euro-Canadian and Chinese-immigrant mothers of boys aged 4- to 8-years participated. Chinese-immigrant mothers had more favorable attitudes towards punishment techniques (i.e., overcorrection and spanking) than Euro-Canadian mothers, and mothers' authoritarian   accounted for this cultural difference. No cultural differences were found in mothers' attitudes towards reward (i.e., praise and token economy) or withdrawal of positive reinforcement (i.e., response cost and time-out). This  helps to inform efforts to increase the cultural sensitivity of mental health services for the underserved population of Chinese-immigrant families."
The Relationship Between Pediatric Residents' Experiences Being Parented and Their Provision of Parenting Advice,2018,"Background: Factors surrounding pediatricians'  advice and training on  during residency have not been well studied. The Resident  Questionnaire (RPQ) was developed to assess (a) the relationship between pediatric residents' upbringing and their  advice  and (b) factors associated with confidence and resource use when delivering  advice. Methods: Three hundred and one pediatric residents from 15 United States residency programs completed the RPQ with upbringing and advice responses categorized using Baumrind's model (authoritative, authoritarian, permissive). Chi-square/Fisher's exact tests, Bowker's test of symmetry, and regression analyses assessed associations between residents' upbringing,  advice /content, and confidence in providing  advice. Results: Most participants indicated being raised authoritatively (68%) and giving authoritative  advice (83%), but advice differed based on how they perceived their upbringing (p < 0.001). Residents noting authoritative upbringing were more likely to give authoritative advice (85%) while others tended to give advice differing from upbringing (e.g., those perceiving authoritarian upbringing were more likely to give authoritative/permissive). Analyses suggest resident race, acculturation, future plans, and resident level are associated with  advice type. Confidence in giving  advice decreased significantly as patient age increased and increased with resident level advancement. Residents reported consulting attending physicians for  advice guidance more than any other evidence-based resources. Conclusion: Most pediatric residents appear to be aware of appropriate authoritative  advice regardless of upbringing, especially as they advance through residency. Residents may benefit from opportunities to reflect upon their upbringing, particularly if raised in authoritarian or permissive . Targeted training of residents on evidence-based  strategies, particularly for older pediatric patients, appears warranted."
"Relationship between body mass index and family functioning, family communication, family type and parenting style among African migrant parents and  in Victoria, Australia: a parent- dyad study",2016,"Background: Although hood obesity prevalence is stabilised in developed countries including Australia, it is continuing to rise among migrants and socially disadvantaged groups in these countries. African migrants and refugees in particular, are at high risk of obesity due to changes in their family dynamics. The aim of this  was to examine the difference between  and al perception of family functioning, family communication, family type and   and their relationship with body mass index. Methods: A cross-sectional - dyad  was conducted among 284 African families from migrant and refugee backgrounds living in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Bilingual workers were trained to collect demographic, anthropometric and questionnaire data on family functioning, , family type and family communication. Results: s and  reported different levels of family dynamics. Children reported a higher prevalence of poor family functioning (61.5 %, 95 % CI: 55.6, 67.2 versus 56.8 %, 95 % CI: 49.7, 61.6) and protective family type (29 %, 95 % CI: 23.9, 34.5 vs. 13.4 %, 95 % CI: 9.9, 17.9), but a lower prevalence of authoritative   (51.6 %, 95 % CI: 45.7, 57.5 vs. 63 %, 95 % CI: 57.5, 68.8) than s. There was a positive relationship between poor family functioning and  BMI both before (beta = 1.28; 95 % CI: 0.14, 2.41; p < 0.05) and after (beta = 1.73; 95 % CI: 0.53, 2.94; p < 0.001) controlling for confounders, and an inverse relationship between consensual family type and  BMI after adjustment (beta = -1.92; 95 % CI: -3.59, -0.24; p < 0.05). There was no significant relationship between al BMI and family functioning, communication, family type or  . Conclusion: Children's perception of poor family functioning was associated with hood obesity. Family interventions to reduce hood obesity need to adopt an intergenerational approach to promote a clear understanding of family dynamics between  and s. Unless these intergenerational challenges associated with family dynamics are clearly addressed in obesity interventions, current obesity prevention initiatives will continue to widen the hood obesity gap in Australia."
Effects of Parenting Stress and Controlling Parenting Attitudes on Problem Behaviors of Preschool Children: Latent Growth Model Analysis,2018,"Purpose: This  was conducted to examine the longitudinal effects of  stress and al control attitudes on problem behaviors in preschool , using a latent growth model. Methods: Participants were 1,724 pairs of s and 1,724 preschool  who had completed the panel survey on Korean  (5(th)similar to 7(th) survey panels). Results: An analysis of the multivariate latent growth model of  stress, al control attitudes, and 's problem behaviors suggested that the s' intercepts for  stress influenced their intercepts for al control attitudes (father: beta=.21, p<.001; mother: (beta=.55, p<.001). In addition, the slopes for fathers'  stress was the only aspect that affected the slopes for mothers' al control attitudes (beta=.77, p<.001). Moreover, both the intercepts and slopes of  stress and al control attitudes significantly affected the 's problem behaviors. Conclusion: This  is significant as it provides longitudinal evidence of the impact of  stress and al control attitudes on 's problem behaviors. The findings suggest that accurately assessing changes in  stress and al control attitudes and developing intervention programs to reduce them will be effective in reducing problem behaviors in ."
"Breastfeeding Duration and Early Parenting Behaviour: The Importance of an Infant-Led, Responsive Style",2014,"Background: Popular  literature promotes different approaches to caring for infants, based around variations in the use of -led routines and promoting infant independence. However, there is little empirical evidence of how these early behaviours affect wider  choices such as infant feeding. Breastfeeding often requires an infant-led approach, feeding on demand and allowing the infant to regulate intake whilst conversely formula feeding is open to greater caregiver manipulation. The infant-led  associated with breastfeeding may therefore be at odds with philosophies that encourage strict use of routine and independence. The aim of this  was to explore the association between early  behaviours and breastfeeding duration. Methods: Five hundred and eight mothers with an infant aged 0-12 months completed a questionnaire examining breastfeeding duration, attitudes and behaviours surrounding early  (e.g. anxiety, use of routine, involvement, nurturance and discipline). Participants were attendees at baby groups or participants of online  forums based in the UK. Results: Formula use at birth or short breastfeeding duration were significantly associated with low levels of nurturance, high levels of reported anxiety and increased maternal use of -led routines. Conversely an infant-led approach characterised by responding to and following infant cues was associated with longer breastfeeding duration. Discussion: Maternal desire to follow a structured  approach which purports use of -led routines and early demands for infant independence may have a negative impact upon breastfeeding duration. Increased maternal anxiety may further influence this relationship. The findings have important implications for Health Professionals supporting new mothers during pregnancy and the postpartum period."
"RELATIONS BETWEEN BULLYING, PERSONALITY TRAITS AND PARENTING PRACTICES",2008,"The main aims of this  were examination of a latent structure of the PRONA questionnaire, intended to measure proneness to bullying, as well as the examination of the relations between the latent dimensions of the PRONA questionnaire and the dimensions of Eysenck's PEN model,  practices, age, and gender. The  was conducted on a sample of 123 participants of both genders, aged 11-13. Proneness to bullying was measured by the 42- item PRONA questionnaire, while Junior EPQ (JEPQ) was used to assess the personality traits of Eysenck's model.  practices were measured by the UVS questionnaire, a 49- item measure. Applying a principal component analysis with Promax rotation, three latent dimensions (which accounted for approximately 31 % of variance) were extracted and interpreted as risky behavior, victimisation and psychological harassment. The relations between these dimensions, personality traits,  practices, age, and gender were examined by a multivariate analysis of covariance. Factor scores on the Promax dimensions of the PRONA questionnaire were the criteria, while gender was a categorical predictor, and the JEPQ's and UVS' first principal components' factor scores were continuous predictors (covarieties). Psychoticism, Lie scale, and Extraversion significantly partially contributed to the prediction of risky behavior scores. Neuroticism, Lie scale, and the dimension of mother's restrictive   were significant predictors of the victimization, while Psychoticism and gender (boys scoring higher) were significantly partially related to psychological harassment."
A phenomenologic investigation of pediatric residents' experiences being parented and giving parenting advice,2016,"Factors surrounding pediatricians'  advice and training on  during residency have not been well studied. The primary purpose of this  was to examine pediatric residents' self-reported experiences giving  advice and explore the relationship between  advice given and types of  residents received as . Thirteen OUHSC pediatric residents were individually interviewed to examine experiences being ed and giving  advice. Phenomenological methods were used to explicate themes and secondary analyses explored relationships of findings based upon Baumrind's   (authoritative, authoritarian, permissive). While hood experiences were not specifically correlated to the  advice  of pediatric residents interviewed, virtually all reported relying upon hood experiences to generate their advice. Those describing authoritative s reported giving more authoritative advice while others reported more variable advice. Core interview themes related to residents'  advice included anxiety about not being a , varying advice based on families' needs, and emphasis of positive interactions and consistency. Themes related to how residents were ed included discipline being a learning process for their s and recalling that their s always had expectations, yet always loved them. Pediatric residents interviewed reported giving family centered  advice with elements of positive interactions and consistency, but interviews highlighted many areas of apprehension residents have around giving  advice. Our  suggests that pediatric residents may benefit from more general educational opportunities to develop the content of their  advice, including reflecting on any impact from their own upbringing."
Firm maternal parenting associated with decreased risk of excessive snacking in overweight ,2015,"Objective To examine the relationship between  feeding practices (restriction, monitoring, pressure to eat), general  behaviors (acceptance, psychological control, firm control), and aberrant  eating behaviors (emotional eating and excessive snacking) among overweight and normal weight . Methods Overweight and normal weight  between 8 and 12 years old and their mothers (n = 79, - dyads) participated in this . Mothers completed surveys on  feeding practices (Child Feeding Questionnaire) and  eating behaviors (Family Eating and Activity Habits Questionnaire). Children reported on their mothers' general  behaviors (Child Report of  Behavior Inventory).  and  height and weight were measured and demographic characteristics assessed. Logistic regression models, stratified by  weight status and adjusting for  BMI, were used to determine which  dimensions and feeding practices were associated with  emotional eating and snacking behavior. Results Overweight  displayed significantly more emotional eating and excessive snacking behavior than normal weight . Mothers of overweight  used more restrictive feeding practices and psychological control. Restrictive feeding practices were associated with emotional eating in the overweight group (OR = 1.26, 95 % CI, 1.02, 1.56) and excessive snacking behavior in the normal weight group (OR = 1.13, 95 % CI, 1.01, 1.26). When examining general , firm control was associated with decreased odds of excessive snacking in the overweight group (OR = 0.51, 95 % CI, 0.28, 0.93). Conclusion Restrictive feeding practices were associated with aberrant  eating behaviors in both normal weight and overweight . Firm general  however, was associated with decreased snacking behavior among overweight . Longitudinal studies following  from infancy are needed to better understand the direction of these relationships."

The minimizing style: Perceptions of psychological abuse and quality of past and current relationships,1999,"Objective: The goals of this current project were to expand and elaborate on the  of Varia, Abidin, and Dass' (1996)  to better understand what historical  factors may contribute in creating a Minimizing perception of hood psychological abuse. A second objective included examining the association between perceptual  and adult ratings of adult relationship satisfaction. Method: Ninety individuals from a non-clinical adult sample completed self-report questionnaires regarding psychological maltreatment and adult relationship satisfaction. Three groups were created and compared using analysis of variance. The groups were (I) Non-Abused, consistent reporters of no abuse; (II) Acknowledgers, consistent reporters of abuse; and (III) Minimizers, reporters of abuse, but do not label themselves as having been abused. Results: Results indicated a continuum effect with the Non-Abused individuals reporting the highest level of maternal warmth and affection, the Acknowledgers reporting the lowest, with the Minimizers in the middle. The Non-Abused group reported the healthiest adjustment in terms of adult relationship satisfaction. While Minimizers and Acknowledgers reported similar levels of psychologically abusive experiences, Acknowledgers reported more difficulties with adult relationships. Conclusions: This  highlights the importance of ing Minimizers, a group which describes abusive events but minimizes the meaning and scope of these experiences. The relatively higher levels of maternal care which the Minimizers reported is hypothesized to be associated with their perceptions that they were not abused and acted as a protective factor associated with better quality adult relationships. The varying degrees of nurturance and care in the early family environment of abused individuals is speculated to be associated with distinct perceptual . (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd."
The additive and interactive effects of parenting style and temperament in obese youth seeking treatment,2008,"Objective: To examine maternal  behaviors,  temperament and their potential interactions in families of obese  and demographically similar families of nonoverweight . Design: A total of 77 obese youth (M body mass index (BMI) z-score values, zBMI = 2.4; ages 8-16, 59% female, 50% African American) and their s were recruited from a pediatric weight management clinic and compared to 69 families of nonoverweight youth (M zBMI = -0.03). Comparison youth were classmates of each obese participant matched on gender, race and age. Measurements: Maternal report of  temperament,   and anthropometric assessments were obtained. Results: Compared to nonoverweight youth, mothers of obese youth described their  as having a more difficult temperament and their   as lower in behavioral control. A logistic regression model indicated that difficult temperament, lower behavioral control and the interaction of low maternal warmth and difficult  temperament were associated with increased odds of a  being classified as obese. Conclusions: Treatment-seeking obese youth and their s are characterized by different  and  factors when compared to nonoverweight comparison families. These findings direct investigators to test more complex models of the relation between  and  characteristics and their mutual role in the weight-related behavior change process.

"Pubertal Timing, Parenting Style, and Trajectories of Pornography Use in Adolescence: Peer Pornography Use as the Mediator",2020,"This  examined the effect of pubertal timing,  , and peer behaviors on the trajectories of pornography use among adolescents. Data consisted of 1272 boys and 1210 girls, who completed at least three waves of pornography use questions from 7th to 12th grade (the year 2007 to 2012). Group-based trajectory modeling was applied to identify the trajectories of pornography use. Multinomial logistic regression and the Z-mediation method were conducted to examine the influences of pubertal timing,  , and peer behaviors on the trajectories and the mediating effect. The  showed that early puberty was associated with earlier exposure to pornography and more frequent exposure later. al monitoring protected adolescents from pornography use, whereas psychological control increased the chance of more exposure. Peer pornography use mediated the relationship between adolescent pornography use, pubertal timing, and al . This mediating effect was stronger among boys versus girls. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of pubertal timing, al , and peer influence on the trajectory of pornography use in adolescence."
"The father- relationship, parenting stvles. and adolescent risk behaviors in intact families",2006,"The father- relationship and father's   are examined as predictors of first delinquency and substance use, using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997, Rounds 1 to 3 (N = 5,345), among adolescents in intact families. Discrete time logistic regressions indicate that a more positive father- relationship predicts a reduced risk of engagement in multiple first risky behaviors. Having a father with an authoritarian   is associated with an increased risk of engaging in delinquent activity and substance use. Two-way interaction models further indicate that the negative effect of authoritarian  is reduced when fathers have a positive relationship with their adolescent. Permissive   predicts less risky behavior when the father- relationship is positive. The positive influence of the father- relationship on risk behaviors is stronger for male than for female adolescents."
Childhood Maltreatment and its Effect on Parenting among High-Risk Parents,2018,"Research evidence indicates that a hood history of maltreatment affects al behaviors in adulthood. The aim of the  was to investigate the predictors for al behaviors among individuals who reported a history of maltreatment. The current  investigated whether attachment , emotional regulation and cognitive appraisals of  predicted al behaviors (positive vs. negative). The   investigated the differential effects of abuse experiences in hood (physical, sexual, emotional, and neglect) on al behaviors. The participants were 213 high-risk Jewish and Arab s of  aged six and under. Participants completed five self-report questionnaires assessing al behaviors, hood experiences of abuse and neglect, attachment , emotional regulation, and cognitive appraisal of hood. The regression analyses revealed that personal attributes such as ethnicity, hood experience of emotional abuse/neglect, emotional regulation, and appraisal of , predict negative al behavior. Anxious attachment and hood emotional abuse and neglect moderated the impact of hood appraisal on  behaviors. Although physical and sexual abuse had the highest impact on insecure attachment, emotional abuse/neglect had higher predictive power for non-positive . Clinical interventions for improving the capacity for emotional regulation and - relational skills are suggested."
"Child Temperament, Maternal Feeding Practices, and Parenting Styles and Their Influence on Obesogenic Behaviors in Hispanic Preschool Children",2019,"Although obesogenic behaviors (physical activity and/or sedentary behavior and dietary intake) are known predictors of hood weight status, little is known about mother and  behaviors contributing to obesogenic behaviors and obesity in Hispanic preschool , whose obesity rate is higher than in non-Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Blacks. The purpose of this cross-sectional, descriptive  was to examine relationships among  temperament, maternal behaviors (feeding practices and  ),  obesogenic behaviors, and  weight status in 100 Hispanic preschool . Results showed that higher scores on the negative affectivity dimension of  temperament were associated with higher scores on the dimension of permissive , and permissive  was associated with less time spent in sedentary behaviors (B = -3.53, confidence interval [-7.52, -0.90]). Findings can guide school nurses in developing interventions that consider  temperament and   to promote nonobesogenic behavior in Hispanic preschoolers."

Co-occurrence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms with other psychopathology in young adults: parenting style as a moderator,2015,"The extent to which   can influence secondary psychiatric symptoms among young adults with ADHD symptoms is unknown. This issue was investigated in a sample of 2284 incoming college students (male, 50.6%), who completed standardized questionnaires about adult ADHD symptoms, other DSM-IV symptoms, and their s'   before their ages of 16. Among them, 2.8% and 22.8% were classified as having ADHD symptoms and sub-threshold ADHD symptoms, respectively. Logistic regression was used to compare the comorbid rates of psychiatric symptoms among the ADHD, sub-threshold ADHD and non-ADHD groups while multiple linear regressions were used to examine the moderating role of gender and   over the associations between ADHD and other psychiatric symptoms. Both ADHD groups were significantly more likely than other incoming students to have other DSM-IV symptoms. al care was negatively associated and al overprotection/control positively associated with these psychiatric symptoms. Furthermore, significant interactions were found of   with both threshold and sub-threshold ADHD in predicting wide-ranging comorbid symptoms. Specifically, the associations of ADHD with some externalizing symptoms were inversely related to level of paternal care, while associations of ADHD and sub-threshold ADHD with wide-ranging comorbid symptoms were positively related to level of maternal and paternal overprotection/control. These  suggest that   may modify the effects of ADHD on the risk of a wide range of temporally secondary DSM-IV symptoms among incoming college students, although other causal dynamics might be at work that need to be investigated in longitudinal studies.

Understanding the Role of Personality in Explaining Associations Between Marital Quality and Parenting,2009,"Analyses assessed the degrees to which personality accounts for associations between marital quality and  and mediates genetic contributions to these relationships. Participants included 318 male and 544 female same-sex twin pairs from the Twin and Offspring Study in Sweden. All twins completed self-report measures of marital quality and personality (anxiousness, aggression, sociability). Composite measures of  negativity and warmth were derived from the twins' and their adolescent 's ratings of the twins' disciplinary  and the emotional tone of the - relationship. Observational ratings of marital quality and  were  obtained for a subset of twins. Personality characteristics explained 33% to 42% of the covariance between reported marital quality and  and 26% to 28% of the covariance between observed marital quality and . For both sets of analyses, personality accounted for more than half of the genetic contributions to covariance between marital quality and . Results indicate that personality significantly contributes to associations between marital quality and  and that personality is an important path through which genetic factors contribute to family relationships."
Parenting and Family Relationships in Chinese Families: A Critical Ecological Approach,2018,"Scholars have recently been paying greater attention to cultural and cross-cultural . However, studies have primarily been on between-group comparisons, using White North American samples as a baseline. This approach  in misleading conclusions that overemphasize intergroup and underemphasize intragroup differences. We focus on Chinese families because they account for one-fifth of the world's population, yet the understanding of Chinese families is limited. Our broad objective is a call to action, emphasizing the importance of moving beyond global and superficial assessments of Chinese . On the basis of Bronfenbrenner's bioecological model, we critically explore the intra- and intergroup intricacies of Chinese  to illustrate how the  of culture and Chinese  has developed over the years. We provide in-depth context for the various Chinese societies (i.e., China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan) and recent social transformations that emphasize the importance of considering the exo- and macrosystems."
Parenting revisited: Profiles and associations with psychological distress among traumatized Chinese adolescents,,"While individual  behaviors have been shown to account for adolescents' posttraumatic symptoms, no  has investigated whether  profiles can relate to posttraumatic symptoms among Chinese adolescents. This  aimed to identify  profiles using person-centered latent profile analysis and examine their associations with psychological distress. Nine hundred and fifty-four Chinese adolescents completed questionnaires measuring their perception of al psychological control, behavioral control, autonomy granting, mother and father rejection, and psychological distress (PTSD and psychiatric co-morbidity). Among them, six hundred and ninety-nine had experienced trauma in the past and were included in the data analysis. Four  profiles were generated: controlling-rejecting (lower level), autonomous-accepting, undifferentiated and controlling-rejecting (higher level). Undifferentiated  was the dominant profile. Adolescents who had s with the autonomous-accepting  profile showed the least distress, while those with the controlling-rejecting (higher level) profile showed the most. Following trauma, adolescents can develop posttraumatic distress, the level of which can vary depending on different perceived  . Adolescents with s who accept and give them autonomy tend to show a low level of distress."
The relationship between 's and adolescents' perceptions of parenting style and internal and external symptoms,2007,"Background This  examined the relationship between 's and adolescents' external (aggression or delinquent behaviour) and internal (depression and anxiety, somatic complaints or regressive behaviour) symptoms and their perceptions of  behaviour. Method Participants were 159  (83 boys and 76 girls) aged 10-17 years and were categorized into five groups. The two experimental groups included clearly defined externalizing (n = 35) and internalizing (n = 46) . Two sibling groups and one non-sibling group served as controls. The five groups were compared for subjective perceptions of maternal and paternal rejection, favouritism and overprotection. Results No effects of age or gender were found. The  revealed that compared with non-symptomatic  from different families and with non-symptomatic siblings, both internalizing and externalizing  obtained higher scores on the variables examined. Externalizing  obtained the highest scores, while internalizing  obtained intermediate scores. The sibling comparison data revealed a gap between the perceptions of symptomatic  and their siblings: symptomatic  reported negative  practices towards both themselves and their siblings, whereas the opposite was true of sibling reports. The reports suggest that while both internalizing and externalizing symptoms are associated with negative perceptions of the - interaction, this may be particularly the case among externalizing . Conclusions The importance of perceptions of reality, as opposed to objective circumstances, is discussed in the context of treatment."
"Associations Between Parenting Styles and Perceived Child Effortful Control Within Chinese Families in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Taiwan",2017,"The current  examined the associations between ally perceived  effortful control (EC) and the   of 122 Chinese mothers (36 first-generation Chinese immigrants in the United Kingdom, 40 first-generation Chinese immigrants in the United States, and 46 Taiwanese mothers) of 5- to 7-year-old (M age = 5.82 years, SD = .805; 68 boys and 54 girls) . The findings showed significant cultural group differences in mothers' reported authoritarian  . Significant associations  emerged between mothers' reports of their 's EC and some  dimensions, although there were no cultural group differences in perceived  EC. Different patterns of associations between perceived  EC and   in these three groups  demonstrated heterogeneity within the Chinese population, and highlighted the need to consider differences between original and receiving societies when seeking to understand  and  development in different immigrant groups."

A self-administered survey was conducted with 100 adolescents who visited the National Museum of Iran in 2016. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation analysis and multiple linear regression analysis. Firstly, the adolescents perceived their s influence on them as more authoritative than authoritarian or permissive. Secondly, the authoritarian   was tied to less self-determined motivation including amotivation and external regulation; authoritative  was found to be related to intrinsic motivation. Finally, the permissive   was a good predictor for introjected motivation."

Methods: Information on s'  of  was obtained from 199 participants in the Adventist Health Study-1 (AHS-1) who 27+ years later  enrolled in the AHS-2 where blood was collected for relative TL (rTL) assessment. Results: Subjects describing their mothers'   as cold had on average 25% smaller rTL compared to subjects not reporting a cold mother (1.89 vs 2.53). This association was greatest among those with less education, and those who stayed overweight/obese or put on weight during follow-up. Conclusions: These  support previous findings that early life stress may have health implications by promoting cellular aging, and expands these stressors to include cold  during an individuals' formative years. Higher education and normal weight seem to provide some resilience."

Mothers who are warm and nurturing were more strongly associated with prosocial behavior in their . An unexpected finding was that mothers with more  were more assertive and strict towards them."
"Hospital acquisitions, parenting styles and management accounting change: An institutional perspective",2017,"Many healthcare scholars have applied institutional theories to the  of management accounting systems (MAS) change. However, little attention has been devoted to MAS change within groups. Kostova et al. highlight the limitations of traditional institutional frameworks in ing groups since they are characterised not only by the existence of external institutional environments but  by intra-organisational (meso-level) ones. Given this background, the  question is: how does the meso-level institutional environment affect MAS change in healthcare groups? We use a longitudinal multiple-case  design to understand the role of headquarters in shaping local MAS change. We would expect companies to adopt similar MAS. However, we argue that the relationship between external institutions and MAS change cannot be wholly understood without taking into consideration the role of headquarters. Our analysis shows how hospitals facing the same external institutional environment implement different MAS as a consequence of different  . From a scientific perspective, our article contributes to broaden traditional institutional theoretical frameworks."
"Homework in the home: How student, family, and parenting-style differences relate to the homework process",2000,"s (n = 709) were surveyed about involvement in their 's homework. A factor analysis revealed three dimensions of homework involvement similar to those found in more general studies of  . These dimensions are autonomy support, direct involvement, and elimination of distractions. A fourth dimension, al interference, differentiated itself from. autonomy support for students in higher grades. Two-thirds of s reported some negative or inappropriate form of involvement.   for homework was then related to student and family characteristics and student schooling outcomes. Results indicated s with students in higher grade levels reported giving students more homework autonomy and less involvement of all other types. s in poorer families reported less support for autonomy and more interference. s reported less elimination of distractions when an adult was not at home after school and. for elementary school students, when there were more than one  living in the home. Elementary school s of males reported more direct involvement in homework, while high school s of females reported more direct involvement. More al support for autonomy was associated with higher standardized test scores, higher class grades, and more homework completed. More positive  involvement was associated with lower test scores and lower class grades, especially for elementary school students. Student attitudes toward homework were unrelated to   for homework. Stage-environment fit theory and conceptions of families as varying in resources to support  are used to explain the findings and draw implications for  behavior and educational practice, (C) 2000 Academic Press."
EARNED-SECURITY AND CONTINUOUS-SECURITY IN ADULT ATTACHMENT - RELATION TO DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMATOLOGY AND PARENTING STYLE,1994,"The secure working model classification of adult attachment, as derived from Main and Goldwyn's (in press) Adult Attachment Interview scoring system, was considered in terms of earned-security and continuous-security. Earned-security was a classification given to adults who described difficult, early relationships with s, but who  had current secure working models as indicated by high coherency scores; continuous-security referred to a classification in which individuals described secure early attachment relationship with s and current secure working models. Working models of attachment were classified as earned-secure, continuous-secure, or insecure in a sample of 40 s of preschool . Comparisons among the classifications were conducted on a measure of depressive symptoms and two sets of ratings of observed  . Adults with earned-secure classifications had comparable depressive symptomatology to insecures, with 30% of the insecures, 40% of the earned-secures, and only 10% of the continuous-secures having scores exceeding the clinical cut-off. The rate of depressive symptomatology in the earned-secure group suggests that reconstructions of past difficulties may remain emotional liabilities despite a current secure working model. With regard to   with their preschoolers, the behavior of earned-secure s was comparable to that of the continuous-secures. This refinement in conceptualizing secure working models suggests ways for understanding variation in pathways to competent  as well as a possible perspective on how adults' adverse early experiences may continue to place them and their  at risk."
The Effect of Parenting Style on Social Smiling in Infants at High and Low Risk for ASD,2016,"This  examined how   at 9 months predicts growth in infant social engagement (i.e., social smiling) between 9 and 18 months during a free-play interaction in infants at high (HR-infants) and low (LR-infants) familial risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Results indicated that across all infants, higher levels of maternal responsiveness were concurrently associated with higher levels of social smiling, while higher levels of maternal directiveness predicted slower growth in social smiling. When accounting for maternal directiveness, which was higher in mothers of HR-infants, HR-infants exhibited greater growth in social smiling than LR-infants. Overall, each   appears to make a unique contribution to the development of social engagement in infants at high-and low-risk for ASD."
Associations of parenting factors and weight related outcomes in African American adolescents with overweight and obesity,2021,"This  evaluated the associations between  factors and adolescent weight related outcomes in African American adolescents with overweight and obesity. Baseline heights and weights were collected from 241 African American adolescents (11-16 years) with overweight and obesity. Self-reported adolescent perceptions of caregiver's   (responsiveness, demandingness), al feeding practices (monitoring, responsibility, weight related concerns, pressure-to-eat, and restriction), and their own dietary self-efficacy for healthy eating were assessed. Results demonstrated that greater al responsiveness was significantly associated with lower adolescent body mass index (BMI) and higher adolescent dietary self-efficacy. In contrast, al concern about adolescent weight was significantly associated with greater adolescent BMI, while greater al responsibility for foods was associated with lower adolescent BMI. Although al pressure-to-eat was significantly associated with higher dietary self-efficacy, greater al restriction was associated with lower dietary self-efficacy. The  of this  highlight the importance of al responsiveness and responsibility in understanding obesity related outcomes in African American adolescents with overweight and obesity."
Emotion Regulation in Relation to Emerging Adults' Mental Health and Delinquency: A Multi-informant Approach,2016,"Relative to the merits of authoritative , potential adverse outcomes are well documented for authoritarian and permissive . However, conclusions are typically drawn from single informants. The ability of youths' emotion regulation skills to mediate outcomes in emerging adults has  not been fully explored. This  investigated whether emotion regulation mediated   history and potential outcomes of mental health and delinquency.   history and emerging adults' emotion regulation ability were reported by 110 youth and their caregivers; youth reported on mental health functioning and delinquency. Emerging adults' emotion regulation ability partially mediated the association between authoritative  history and mental health functioning and authoritative  history was indirectly related to delinquency through emotion regulation; however, based on all reporters, emotion regulation ability was not associated with authoritarian or permissive   history. Results support that the merits of authoritative  may lie in fostering better emotion regulation skills."
"Early Feeding, Child Behaviour and Parenting as Correlates of Problem Eating",2017,"Mealtimes are a common source of stress for families. Examining factors related to problem eating may provide markers by which to identify families requiring assistance and salient targets for treatment. The current  investigated  practices and cognitions, generalisation of  behavioural issues, and early feeding history as they relate to problem eating in typically developing young . We compared a community sample of 105 s of 1.5-6-year-old  via survey and observation with 96 s seeking treatment for their 's problem eating. History of problems with breastfeeding, chi(2)(1) = 3.88, p = .049, and the transition to solids, chi(2)(1) = 7.27, p = .007, were more common among problem eaters than comparisons. Problem eaters had a greater number of problem behaviours outside of mealtimes, F(1181) = 10.88, p = .001, though not more frequently than comparisons and not to clinical levels, F(1181) = 1.81, p = .181. s of problem eaters reported more unhelpful mealtime  strategies, F(1155) = 22.59, p < .001, yet general   was similar by group, F(1187) = 0.42, p = .527. s' cognitions about mealtimes, F(1155) = 119.81, p < .001, including mealtime-specific self-efficacy, F(1155) = 171.30, p < .001, were poorer amongst problem eaters, and were the only factors to predict problem eating in the total sample. General  self-efficacy was poorer in s of problem eaters (Behaviour: F(1187) = 42.36, p < .001; Setting: F(1187) = 10.64, p = .001). Evidence of feeding issues in infancy may support early detection of and intervention for later problem eating.

The moderating effects of parenting styles on the relation between the internet attitudes and internet behaviors of high-school students in Taiwan,2016,"The purpose of this  is to investigate how   moderate the relation between the Internet attitudes and behaviors of high-school-aged students in Taiwan. We review the literature on studies of   and Internet attitudes, and their relations between Internet behaviors. We employed Latent Class Analysis to cluster the -reported  . In this regard, we found that there exist three types of   in Taiwan. We in turn implemented the 2nd-order confirmatory factor analysis to validate the 6-T internet attitude model. The so-called 6-T internet attitude model is to explain the Internet attitude by the multi-dimensions such as Tool, Telephone, Toy, Territory, Treasure and Trade. It provides the basis on which we conducted the structural regression modeling. Three kinds of Internet behavior online social compensation seeking, online game addiction and information security behavior are analyzed in our . We used the structural regression modeling to incorporate the 2nd-order confirmatory factor analysis and path analysis so that we can tell the moderating effects of   on the relation between Internet attitudes and Internet behavior by multi group analysis.

Cultural value orientation and authoritarian parenting as parameters of bullying and victimization at school,2013,"The purpose of the   was to examine the existing association between cultural value orientation, authoritarian , and bullying and victimization at school. The participants (N=231) were early adolescents, randomly selected from 11 different schools in urban and rural areas of Cyprus. Participants completed self reports measuring cultural value orientation, authoritarian , bullying, and victimization. These instruments were the following: the Cultural Value Scale (CVS), the al Authority Questionnaire (PAQ), and the Revised Bullying and Victimization Questionnaire (BVQ-R). Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine mediation effects. It was found that vertical individualism acted as a mediator between authoritarian  and bullying. Statistically significant positive correlations were found between authoritarian  and the vertical dimensions of both cultural value orientations (individualism and collectivism), but not with the horizontal dimensions of either cultural orientation. Further, authoritarian  was  positively associated with bullying and victimization at school. The main contribution of the   is the finding that vertical individualism significantly mediates the relationship between authoritarian al  and bullying propensity."

The  is based on an ethnographic  of 32 American middle-class families and takes a discourse analytic approach. Earlier  has argued that   are dependent on social class, ethnicity, and gender. The  data reveal considerable diversity in how middle-class s deal with game play, which is currently one of the most common  and youth leisure activities. This diversity is seen across stances taken within the same interview and across interviews. It is argued that differences in middle-class families'   are related to their view of the  and their stance on game technology.

Moderating effects of family environment on overweight/obese adolescents' dietary behaviours,2019,"Background: The familial environment can influence adolescents' risk for obesity. However, we do not fully understand the mechanisms through which s can influence overweight/obese adolescents' dietary behaviours, specifically whether  practices (e.g., rules or routines) and/or their own dietary behaviours are associated with their overweight/obese adolescent's dietary quality. Objectives: This  examined whether  practices and/or al modeling of dietary quality are associated with overweight/obese adolescents' dietary quality while considering the moderating effects of   and family functioning. Methods: Baseline data from 172 overweight/obese adolescents and one of their s who enrolled in a life modification intervention were analyzed [mean age = 13.1 (1.8); mean BMI z-score = 2.70 (0.83)]. -adolescent dyads completed three 24-hr dietary recalls online. An index of dietary quality was computed by summing the scores for different food categories assessed in the dietary recall over 3 days. s completed questionnaires about their family functioning, dietary  practices (i.e., whether  eats breakfast everyday), and  (authoritative and permissive). Path analysis was used to model interrelationships among the variables using the Stata software version 13. Results: al modeling of dietary quality was significantly associated with adolescent dietary quality. Additionally,   significantly moderated al modeling, such that an authoritative   in conjunction with modeling healthy eating habits was associated with better adolescent dietary quality. Conclusions: This work suggests that al modeling of health behaviours is important; however, it is necessary to consider the broader emotional/relational context into which modeling is expressed since   moderated these effects. This  provides insight into how   may alter the effectiveness of al modeling and highlights the need to account for   to improve the efficacy of current family-based interventions."
Examination of Korean Immigrant Mothers' Parenting Practices: By Using the Framework of Bilinear Acculturation,2021,"By using the conceptual framework of bilinear acculturation, this  examined Korean immigrant mothers'  practices among 389 mother-youth (adolescent  in middle or high school) dyads. We examined (a) how mothers' acculturation and enculturation were related to mainstream (i.e., authoritarian vs. authoritative , communication, warmth/bonding, autonomy support) versus culture specific  practices (i.e., interdependence, commitment to education, academic control) and (b) how  practices were, in turn, linked to youth outcomes of depression, antisocial behaviors, and academic performance as measured 1.5 years later. Mothers and youth had significant perceptual gaps in  practices, especially in autonomy support and al commitment to education. Therefore, path analyses were conducted separately for mother-reported versus youth-reported . As hypothesized, mothers' acculturation was more closely related to mainstream , while enculturation was to culture specific . Mother-reported autonomy support predicted higher academic performance, while youth-reported authoritarian  predicted lower academic performance. Youth-reported communication predicted lower depression and antisocial behaviors. The current findings have implications for  and family interventions to optimize Korean immigrant youth's well-being in the bicultural context.

In pediatric care, especially pediatric nurses need to understand the differences in 's physical, emotional, and social development, and they should provide  with the love, affection and attention they need. Under the current circumstances in our country, not all nurses may find a chance to work in their field of choice. For this reason, the liking of  in nurses and the   they were raised with are of particular importance. This  was designed to determine and evaluate the  attitudes and liking of  in nurses working in pediatric and adult clinics. Materials and Methods: The current  using a descriptive  design included 160 nurses working at Samsun Ondokuz Mayis University, who agreed to participate in the . The  data were collected using Personal Information Form, Liking of Children Scale and Family Life and Child Rearing Attitude Scale ( al Attitude Research Instrument-PARI). Results: Of the nurses participating in the , 62.5% were in the age range of 22-30, 59.4% were married and 65.6% had a bachelor's degree. While 71.9% of the nurses reported choosing this profession through their own decisions, 79.4% reported that they were raised with democratic  of . The  revealed that the liking of  and  attitudes were not affected by the fields nurses work in (p>0.05). Conclusion: We found no statistically significant correlation between the scores for liking of  and  attitudes and the sociodemographic characteristics of nurses and  of  they were raised with."
Do Parenting Styles Moderate the Association Between Family Conformity Orientation and Young Adults' Mental Well-Being?,2012,"This  investigated   (i.e., authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive) as moderators of the association between family conformity orientation and young adults' self-esteem and depression. Participants included 213 young adult . Preliminary analyses revealed an inverse association between family conformity and young adults' self-esteem, a positive relationship between mothers' and fathers' authoritativeness and self-esteem, and a positive relationship between perceptions of mothers' permissiveness and young adults' depression. Hierarchical regression analyses provided no evidence to suggest that   moderate the association between family conformity orientation and young adults' self-esteem and depression. However, the  revealed small, but meaningful positive effects for both mothers' and fathers' authoritativeness on young adults' self-esteem, as well as a positive main effect for family conformity on depression. Two additional analyses of covariance revealed that young adults from pluralistic families had higher self-esteem and lower depression than young adults from protective, laissez faire, and consensual families."
PARENTING AS PAUL'S PREFERRED STYLE OF LEADERSHIP: SOME INSIGHTS FOR CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP IN FAITH COMMUNITIES,2017,"Introducing the Journal of New Testament Studies of 2004 which carried a number of articles on early Christian families, MacDonald and Moxnes (2004:3-6) observed that, The hope is that a direct focus on 'family matters' will shed new light on such diverse topics as rituals, leadership, asceticism, social location, community growth, and the lives of women,  and slaves in early Christianity. In this article I focus on how 'family matters,' specifically , shed light on Paul's practice and understanding of leadership. In a world where poor leadership has led us into a number of problems (political, environmental, economic, ecclesiastical, etc), the subject of leadership becomes very important. In Christian circles, models of leadership with a biblical basis are likely to be more effective. In support of servant leadership, the article therefore uses Paul's imagery of  as a model that he preferred leaders to follow. Using the undisputed Pauline letters, the article analyses texts like 1 Cor. 3:2, 4:15,17, 2 Cor. 6:13, Philm 10, Phil. 2:22 and 1 Thess. 2:7,11 from a historical critical perspective to draw lessons on leadership for communities of faith."
"Mediational Links Among Parenting Styles, Perceptions of Parental Confidence, Self-Esteem, and Depression on Alcohol-Related Problems in Emerging Adulthood",2009,"Objective: Depression is often found to be comorbid with alcohol-related problems. al overprotection, which may be of particular importance during emerging adulthood, has been linked to internalizing symptoms in offspring. This article evaluates the impact of   and al confidence in their offspring on an internalizing pathway to alcohol-related problems through self-esteem and depression. Method: Mediational links were tested among   (authoritative, authoritarian, permissive), al confidence (overprotection, autonomy), self-esteem, depression, and alcohol-related problems. A two-group, multiple indicator multiple-cause structural equation model with 441 (216 female, 225 male) college students was examined. Results: Overall, having a father who was confident in his 's ability to make autonomous decisions was protective against depression for both genders. Perceptions of paternal autonomy mediated the impact of the fathers'   (authoritative, permissive) on depression for both genders. For men, al overprotection mediated the impact of an authoritarian father on self-esteem, and self-esteem mediated the impact of al overprotection on depression. Moreover, among men, perceptions of maternal autonomy mediated the impact of the mothers'   (authoritative, permissive) on self-esteem, and self-esteem mediated the impact of maternal autonomy on depression. Conclusions: The current pattern of findings is distinct from pathways through behavioral undercontrol with influences from the same-sex  for both genders. These findings indicate that  may have differential influences on internalizing pathways to alcohol-related problems. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs 70: 215-226, 2009)"
Sleep duration in Mexican American : Do mothers' and fathers' parenting and family practices play a role?,2019,"This  examined  ,  practices and family practices that may be associated with weeknight sleep duration among 8- to 10-year-old Mexican American (MA) . This cross-sectional  of MA  used baseline data from a 2-year cohort  of mother- pairs (n = 308) with additional data on fathers (n = 166). Children's weeknight sleep duration was accelerometer estimated and averaged for 2 weeknights. s reported on their   and practices regarding food and family food-related practices. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to examine sleep duration with   and practices, and family practices, and adjusting for  gender and body mass index. Model 1 included mothers'   and practices; Model 2 included both mothers' and fathers'   and practices. Children's average sleep duration was 9.5 (SD = 0.8) hr. Mothers who used pressure to encourage their  to eat and those who used food to control behavior had  with longer sleep duration (beta = 0.21, p < 0.01; beta = 0.15, p = 0.03, respectively). Mothers who reported their  ate dinner with the TV on and those who valued eating dinner as a family had  with shorter sleep duration (beta = -0.16, p = 0.01; beta = -0.18, p = 0.01, respectively). Fathers who restricted the amount of food their  ate had  with shorter sleep duration (beta = -0.27, p = 0.01). Mothers' and fathers' feeding practices, the 's eating dinner with the TV on, and valuing family dinners, played a role in 's weeknight sleep duration among Mexican American families. al feeding practices and family mealtime contexts may have an effect on 's weeknight sleep duration."
Socioeconomic Differences in Parenting Strategies to Prevent Adolescent Smoking: A Case Study from the Netherlands,2016,"Purpose This  aimed to identify possible socioeconomic differences in the use of anti-smoking  strategies. Methods In 2012, survey data of adolescents (N = 225) aged 13 to 17 years and their mothers (N = 122) and fathers (N = 105) were collected in Haarlem, the Netherlands. Questions on smoking behaviour and eleven anti-smoking  strategies were answered by adolescents, mothers and fathers. School tracks of adolescents and educational level of s were measured as indicators of socioeconomic position. Linear multilevel regression analyses were applied to  the association between socioeconomic position (SEP) and standardised scores of anti-smoking strategies. Analyses were controlled for age, sex and smoking by s and adolescents. Results We found no consistent socioeconomic differences in the use of anti-smoking  strategies. There were no statistically significant differences in relation to al educational level or when using adolescent reports on  practices. However, when using al reports, a few strategies varied significantly according to adolescent educational track. Adolescents in higher educational tracks were more likely to have no-smoking rules in the home (standardised regression coefficient (beta) = 0.20, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.03; 0.37, p = 0.022) and more likely to have a no-smoking agreement (beta = 0.17, 95 % CI: 0.00; 0.34, p = 0.048). However, they were less likely to frequently communicate about smoking with their s (beta = -0.25, 95 % CI: -0.41; -0.08, p = 0.004). Conclusion In this specific population, there was no consistent support for the hypothesis that anti-smoking  strategies contribute to socioeconomic inequalities in adolescent smoking. al factors that are more likely to contribute to these inequalities include al smoking and  ."
Parenting and psychopathology: Differences in family members' perceptions of parental rearing styles,1997,"Psychiatric patients generally report more adverse recollections of their s' rearing behaviour than individuals from the general community. II is, however, as yet unclear whether we can infer from this finding that the families of psychiatric patients differ from the families of healthy controls, that is, whether patients' adverse views are shared by their family members. This issue bears on the construct validity of reports about al rearing : should these reports be interpreted to reflect characteristics of the family, of the , of the - relationship, or of the individual providing the reports? In this , patterns of agreement and variability within families with regard to recalled al behaviour were analysed in order to examine this aspect of the validity of al reations. We examined whether families of psychiatric patients report less favourable   than families of healthy controls. Furthermore, we examined the level of agreement between all family members participating in the , between the two members reporting on the sane - relationship, between s, and between siblings. Finally, we examined what factors might be accountable for differences of opinion between family members. Results suggested that perceptions of al rearing  are primarily tales by individuals, and to a much smaller extent tales about families, s or relationships. The implications of these findings for  with regard to the relationship between al rearing behaviour and adult psychopathology are discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd."
Discipline styles and co-morbid disorders of adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: a longitudinal study,2014,"Introduction. Problems in cognitive functioning, social and educational development of  with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) continue to be  in adolescence and adulthood. Although the literature shows a significant relationship between the use of dysfunctional discipline methods and severity in the course of ADHD, follow-up studies have been rare. Aims. To analyze   and ADHD symptomatology assessed in hood (time 1) to predict the oppositional behavior and cognitive problems in early adolescence (time 2), and to , depending on the use of dysfunctional  , the course of oppositional behavior and cognitive problems. Patients and methods. Forty-five  with ADHD-combined ation were assessed in two different moments: time 1 (ages: 6-13) and time 2 (ages: 8-16). Results. Oppositionism and cognitive problems in the follow-up were predicted by dysfunctional discipline  and ADHD severity (assessed in time 1). Oppositional behavior increased between time 1 and time 2 in  with a dysfunctional , whereas a decrease on oppositional symptoms was observed in the functional  group (time x discipline interaction effect). Conclusions. Dysfunctional  practices in hood predicted cognitive and behavioral problems associated in adolescence. The findings have implications for the planning of interventions."
An evaluation of a brief universal seminar series on positive parenting: a feasibility study,2009,"This  examined the impact of a brief seminar series on positive  (Selected Triple P) on behavioural and emotional problems in pre-adolescent  and on inter-al conflict,  , relationship quality, al adjustment and al confidence. Two hundred and forty-four s with  aged four to seven years were assigned to one of three conditions: (a) partial exposure condition involving attendance at a single introductory seminar; (b) full exposure (attendance at all three seminars); or (c) a waitlist control group. Analyses were completed for the 109 participants for whom full data were obtained. There was a significant reduction in al reports of problem  behaviour and dysfunctional   with the introductory seminar alone. However, exposure to all three seminars was associated with significant improvements in all dysfunctional   and in the level of inter-al conflict. There were no significant differences between conditions at post-intervention on al reports of depression, anxiety, stress, relationship quality or al confidence. This  provides preliminary support for the efficacy of a brief universal  intervention in improving  behaviour and  variables associated with the development and maintenance of  conduct problems. The findings  offer preliminary support for the notion that positive outcomes for both s and  can be achieved through the delivery of brief preventive  interventions that require minimal time commitments from s."
Parenting and Adolescent Grandiose Narcissism: Mediation through Independent Self-Construal and Need for Positive Approval,2018,"While particular   and  qualities have been linked to adolescent narcissistic tendencies, their association is likely indirect. s aim to indoctrinate adolescents with dispositional tendencies, such as self-confidence independence and a focus on peer acceptance, which incidentally manifest in narcissism. The authors investigated whether mothers' and fathers' positive  and lax discipline were linked indirectly to adolescent grandiose narcissism through a need for positive approval and independent self-construal. Adolescents (n = 460; 58.5% girls; age range = 15-18years) completed several measures online. Structural equation modeling revealed that maternal positive  and discipline were indirectly linked to grandiose narcissism through adolescents' need for positive approval. Fathers' positive  was linked directly and partially through independent self-construal to grandiose narcissism. Fathers' discipline remained directly associated with adolescent grandiose narcissism. Discussion focuses on the nuanced association between  and grandiose narcissism in adolescents and the implications for upholding behavioral standards."
Parenting the premature infant: balancing vulnerability and quality of life,2005,"Background: Relationships between  quality of life (QOL), maternal well-being and  were explored in a questionnaire . Method: Mothers of 126 full-term (FT) and 91 pre-term (PT) infants during the 's second year of life completed measures of their own and the 's quality of life and behavioural difficulties. We developed a measure of   derived from Regulatory Focus Theory (RFT), to distinguish greater reported use of promotion as opposed to prevention strategies (emphasising gains rather than losses, and encouraging pursuit of goals rather than prevention of harm). Results: The two groups of mothers showed no differences on the  measure, but those in the PT compared with the FT group described their infant as having lower QOL and more behavioural and mood problems, and rated their own well-being as less satisfactory. Greater use of promotion was associated with reports of fewer difficulties (better QOL) for the  and better mothers' well-being. Differences in mothers' well-being as a function of group (FT vs. PT) and promotion were strongly mediated by mothers' perceptions of their 's difficulties. At the same time, associations with  difficulties were partly mediated by mothers' well-being, suggesting that maternal distress may have partly contributed to higher perceptions of such difficulties. Among PT infants, the degree of prematurity predicted  difficulties, but was not consistently related to mothers' well-being. Discussion: Mothers of PT infants report more physical health and behavioural difficulties than mothers of FT infants, but specific   can contribute to  difficulties and QOL in both infants and their mothers. Conclusion: We conclude that RFT has potential for understanding the conflicts experienced by s caring for vulnerable ."

Maternal characteristics influence infant feeding styles in Caribbean women,2021,"Objective: To examine associations between maternal characteristics and feeding  in Caribbean mothers. Design: Participants were mother- pairs enrolled in a cluster randomised trial of a  intervention in three Caribbean islands. Maternal characteristics were obtained by questionnaires when infants were 6-8 weeks old. Items adapted from the Toddler Feeding Behaviour Questionnaire were used to assess infant feeding  at the age of 1 year. Feeding  were identified using factor analysis and associations with maternal characteristics assessed using multilevel linear regression. Setting: Health clinics in St. Lucia (n 9), Antigua (n 10) and Jamaica (n 20). Participants: A total of 405 mother- pairs from the larger trial. Results: Maternal depressive symptoms were associated with uninvolved (beta = 0 center dot 38, 95 % CI (0 center dot 14, 0 center dot 62)), restrictive (beta = 0 center dot 44, 95 % CI (0 center dot 19, 0 center dot 69)) and forceful (beta = 0 center dot 31, 95 % CI (0 center dot 06, 0 center dot 57)) feeding and inversely associated with responsive feeding (beta = -0 center dot 30, 95 % CI (-0 center dot 56, -0 center dot 05)). Maternal vocabulary was inversely associated with uninvolved (beta = -0 center dot 31, 95 % CI (-0 center dot 57, -0 center dot 06)), restrictive (beta = -0 center dot 30, 95 % CI (-0 center dot 56, -0 center dot 04)), indulgent (beta = -0 center dot 47, 95 % CI (-0 center dot 73, -0 center dot 21)) and forceful (beta = -0 center dot 54, 95 % CI (-0 center dot 81, -0 center dot 28)) feeding. Indulgent feeding was negatively associated with socio-economic status (beta = -0 center dot 27, 95 % CI (-0 center dot 53, -0 center dot 00)) and was lower among mothers >= 35 years (beta = -0 center dot 32, 95 % CI (-0 center dot 62, -0 center dot 02)). Breast-feeding at 1 year was associated with forceful feeding (beta = 0 center dot 41, 95 % CI (0 center dot 21, 0 center dot 61)). No significant associations were found between maternal education, BMI, occupation and feeding . Conclusion: Services to identify and assist mothers with depressive symptoms may benefit infant feeding . Interventions to promote responsive feeding may be important for less educated, younger and socio-economically disadvantaged mothers."
"Achievement perceived, parenting, internet use and adolescent behavior",2019,"The intensive use of the Internet can contribute to the development of serious psychosocial dysfunctions in adolescents. The purpose of this  is to analyze the relationships between achievement perceived with the leisure use of the internet, , and externalized and internalized problems during adolescence (aggressiveness reactive, proactive, physical and verbal, affiliation with deviant peers and emotional instability). The sample is made of 762 adolescents from 12 to 17 years old (M = 13.69, SD = 1.40), with 52.8% of males and 47.2% of females. The use of internet in leisure time is between 0-98 hours per week. Hence the population distributed in quartiles. The variables have been obtained through standardized tests. Statistical analyzes are descriptive and predictive methodology. The analyses carried out have allowed us to obtain three conclusions. First, the number of hours of internet for recreational purposes is related to worse achievement perceived of the adolescent. Second, it has been found that adolescents who use Internet intensively greater perceived permissiveness of the s and a lower support and communication with them. These adolescents  an increased risk of joining deviant peers and have higher rates of emotional instability and aggressiveness (reactive, proactive, and physical and verbal). Third, more punitive , aggressiveness and affiliation with deviant peers boost the intensive use of the internet. This empirical  corroborates the need for adequate training aimed at fostering al- support and communication to educate the rational and responsible use of the Internet by both s and adolescents (C) 2019 Fundacion Universitaria Konrad Lorenz."
Indulgent Feeding Style and Children's Weight Status in Preschool,2008,"Purpose: The primary aim of this  was to examine whether  affect and  temperament characteristics differ across feeding  in low-income families, given suggestive evidence. The secondary aim was to examine whether feeding  were still related to 's body mass index independent of  affect,  temperament, and known correlates. Methods: Participants in this  were 718 s of s attending Head Start programs across two sites (Texas and Alabama). s were categorized into feeding  of authoritative (n = 118), authoritarian (n = 219), indulgent (n = 240) and uninvolved (n = 141) using a -report questionnaire characterizing feeding in a general  paradigm. s completed questionnaires and measured height and weight was obtained from s and . Results: Differences were found across feeding  on  affect and  temperament characteristics. indulgent s reported lower Negative Affect for themselves and lower Negative Affectivity for their . The indulgent feeding  was significantly associated with higher  body mass index after controlling for  affect,  temperament, and correlates (ethnicity,  age,  body mass index). Conclusions: The  of this  not only show a robust association between the indulgent feeding  and weight status of low-income preschool s, but  suggest how congruence between  emotional affect and  temperament characteristics may contribute to excess consumption among  of indulgent s."
The distressed (Type D) personality mediates the relationship between remembered parenting and psychological distress in cardiac patients,2014,"Objective: Both the distressed (Type D) personality (i.e. the combination of negative affectivity and social inhibition traits) and dysfunctional   are associated with anxiety and depression. As   have been related to personality development, dysfunctional   may  be associated with Type D personality. We examined whether remembered  was associated with anxiety and depression in cardiac patients and whether Type D personality mediated this relationship.Methods: Our sample comprised 435 patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and 123 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Type D Scale (DS14), and Remembered Relationship with s (RRP10) scale.Results: Remembered  was significantly associated with higher anxiety and depression levels and Type D personality. In multivariable linear regression analyses, Type D personality accounted for 25-29% of the variance in anxiety and 23-46% of the variance in depression, while remembered  was no longer significantly associated with these domains. Sobel tests and bootstrapping indicated that Type D personality mediated the relationship between remembered  and anxiety and depression.Conclusion: Type D personality mediated the relationship between remembered  and anxiety and depression in both PCI and CHF patients."
Quality of life and parental styles assessed by adolescents suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases and their parents,2016,"Background: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) in adolescents are chronic medical conditions with a substantial influence on the quality of life (QoL) of the families. Methods: A total of 27 adolescents suffering from IBD, 39 healthy adolescents, and their s were included in the cross-sectional . The adolescents completed the questionnaires ADOR ( ), KidScreen-10 (QoL), SAD (The Scale of Anxiety in Children), and CDI (Children's Depression Inventory). The s completed the BAI (Beck Anxiety Inventory), BDI-II (Beck Depression Inventory, second version), and PedsQL (Pediatrics Quality of Life) Family Impact Module. Results: The al  of the s of the IBD adolescents and controls were without significant differences. The only exception was that fathers' positive al  was significantly higher in the fathers of the controls. There were no statistically significant differences between the IBD  and controls in the QoL assessed using KidScreen-10. However, the QoL, of the s of the ill  was significantly lower than that of the s of the controls (PedsQL total scores in mothers 66.84 +/- 14.78 vs 76.17 +/- 14.65 and in fathers 68.86 +/- 16.35 vs 81.74 +/- 12.89, respectively). The mothers of the IBD adolescents were significantly more anxious (BA I scores 9.50 10.38 vs 5.26 +/- 4.75) and the fathers more depressed (BDI-II scores 7.23 +/- 6.50 vs 3.64 +/- 3.51) than the s of the controls, but there was no difference in the levels of anxiety or depression between the IBD adolescents and the controls. The positive al  of both the s of the  suffering from IBD positively correlated with the QoL of the adolescents evaluated by KidScreen-10. The positive al  of the fathers negatively correlated with the 's state and trait anxiety and negatively correlated with the severity of hood depression. Conclusion: The fathers of the IBD adolescents may exhibit low levels of positive   and be mildly depressed, and the mothers tend to exhibit higher levels of anxiety."
Parenting styles of abusive mothers in group-living rhesus macaques,1998,"Maternal abuse of offspring in group-living monkeys was investigated to assess whether abuse of infants can be interpreted as an adaptive reduction of al expenditure or as a behavioural pathology. I compared the   of 10 abusive and 10 non-abusive rhesus macaque, Macaca mulatta, mothers living in three large captive groups over the first 12 weeks of infant life. I  analysed the social interactions between mothers and infants and other individuals. Abusive females scored higher than controls on several measures of maternal protectiveness and rejection, indicating that they were highly controlling mothers. They  received fewer contacts and approaches from other individuals, and tended to be more aggressive and more interested in other females' infants compared to non-abusive mothers. Infant abuse was accompanied by similar or higher al expenditure in the offspring rather than by a reduction in expenditure, as predicted by the adaptive hypothesis. Therefore, the  of this  support the hypothesis that infant abuse is a form of behavioural pathology. Infant abuse in rhesus macaques shows parallels with that in other primate species, but some of its characteristics could be a by-product of species-specific behavioural adaptations of rhesus macaques.

"Fathers' and mothers' attachment styles, couple conflict, parenting quality, and 's behavior problems: an intervention test of mediation",2019,"A diverse sample of 239 primarily low-income couples participated in a random controlled trial of the Supporting Father Involvement couples group intervention. In this report, we examined the value of adding measures of fathers' attachment  and  to mothers' measures in order to explain variations in 's behavior problems. We  tested the hypothesis that the link between intervention-induced reductions in couple conflict and reductions in anxious/harsh  can be explained by intervention effects on s' attachment insecurity or on anxiety and depression. Fathers' attachment security and  behavior added significantly to mothers' in accounting for 's internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors. Fathers' anxious attachment  and anxiety/depression mediated the link between post-intervention reductions in al conflict and anxious/harsh . For mothers, only improvements in attachment security accounted for those links. The findings support the need for attachment ers to consider the contributions of both s to their 's development."
"INTER-PARENTAL CONFLICTS, PARENTING STYLES AND INTERNALIZED PROBLEMS IN ADOLESCENT SONS AND DAUGHTERS",2016,"In this  the relationship between inter al conflicts and internalized problems of adolescent  was analyzed, as well as the potential mediating effect that two dimensions of   (affection and psychological control) may have on that relationship. Sample consisted of 2,389 adolescents aged between 12 and 17 years. Results showed significant relationships between inter-al conflicts as perceived by adolescents and their internalized problems. In addition, a partial mediating effect of al warmth and psychological control on this relationship was found. Moreover, data provided evidence of the greater vulnerability of younger teens (12 and 13 years old), and girls in general, in face of inter-al conflicts."
Dissociation as a mediator between perceived parental rearing style and depression in an adult community population using college students,2007,"The purpose of this  was to investigate the mediating process in the relationship between early  and depressive symptoms. In particular, the potential role of dissociation as a mediator between the perceived al rearing  during hood and depression in adulthood was examined, along with the effect of avoidance as a coping . A total of 449 undergraduates (231 men and 218 women) completed five measures: the al Bonding Instrument (PBI), the  Scale of Inconsistency (PSI), the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES), the Depression Scale of the GHQ-60, and the Tri-axial Coping Scale (TAC-24). Path analyses were conducted to test for mediating effects. The findings showed different paths by gender. For men, dissociation mediated the relationship between overprotective  and depressive symptoms, although for women, dissociation mediated the relationship between inconsistent  and depressive symptoms. Avoidance as a coping  had no effect on depressive symptoms. The mediating role of dissociation between perceived   and depressive symptoms was confirmed in a community sample. Some clinical and  implications of the  were outlined. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd."
Adolescents' perceived parenting styles and their substance use: Concurrent and longitudinal analyses,2001,"The relation between   and adolescent substance use (tobacco, alcohol, hashish, and amphetamines) was examined concurrently (at age 14) for licit drug use and longitudinally (from age 14 to 17) for both licit and illicit drug use in a sample of 347 youth from compulsory schools in Reykjavik, Iceland. After controlling for adolescent perceptions of al and peer use, own previous use, and gender,  indicated that adolescents who characterized their s as authoritative were more protected against substance use than adolescents who perceived their s as neg glectful, both concurrently and longitudinally. Compared with adolescents who characterized their s as authoritative and neglectful, those from authoritarian and indulgent families each showed a different pattern of substance use both with regard to the type of substance and over time in a longer term perspective."
"Temperament, recalled parenting styles, and self-regulation: Testing the developmental postulates of self-discrepancy theory",1998,"Self-discrepancy theory (SDT) postulates that self-regulatory systems corresponding to the ideal and ought self-domains emerge from the influences of temperament (e.g., sensitivity to stimuli for positive vs. negative outcomes) and socialization (e.g.,  behaviors and interpersonal outcome contingencies). This article reports 2 studies testing the developmental postulates of SDT concurrently and retrospectively. Study 1 showed that self-regulation with reference to the ideal vs. the ought domain was differentially associated with recollections of   of warmth and rejection, respectively. In Study 2, these findings were replicated, and self-regulation with reference to the ideal vs, ought domain was discriminantly associated with questionnaire measures of positive vs. negative temperament. Findings support the developmental postulates of SDT, despite the limitations of retrospective studies."
Early material parenting and adolescents' materialism: the mediating role of overt narcissism,,"Although material  is a very common   in China, it has received little attention from ers, and thus far, only one  has demonstrated that early material  fosters materialism in adulthood. However, whether early material  promotes materialism in adolescents remains unknown. Therefore, this  aimed to examine the relationship between material  and materialism and the underlying mechanisms among Chinese adolescents by conducting two retrospective surveys. A pilot  was first designed to test the recall bias and - rating agreement on a small sample of - dyads (N = 222) using a pairing questionnaire. The  showed that there was no significant systematic error that may affect the relationship between the variables and revealed a high rating agreement between  and s on material . Then, a formal  investigated the relationship between material  and materialism among a larger sample of adolescents (N = 1173) and examined the mediating role of overt narcissism. We found that both conditional material rewards and unconditional material rewards positively predicted materialism, and overt narcissism played a mediating role in the relationship. Our findings indicate that early material  may lead to 's overt narcissism and subsequently foster their materialistic values in adolescence."
The development of 's inhibition: Does parenting matter?,2014,"Whereas a large body of  has investigated the maturation of inhibition in relation to the prefrontal cortex, far less  has been devoted to environmental factors that could contribute to inhibition improvement. The aim of the current  was to test whether and to what extent  matters for inhibition development from 2 to 8 years of age. Data were collected from 421 families, with 348 mother- dyads and 342 father- dyads participating. Children's inhibition capacities and  behaviors were assessed in a three-wave longitudinal data collection. The main analyses examined the impact of  on the development of 's inhibition capacities. They were conducted using a multilevel modeling (MLM) framework. The  lead to the conclusion that both mothers and fathers contribute through their -rearing behavior to their 's executive functioning, even when controlling for age-related improvement (maturation) and important covariates such as gender, verbal IQ and place of enrollment. More significant relations between 's inhibition development and  were displayed for mothers than for fathers.

Group Triple P was designed to be delivered over 8 consecutive weeks, but in response to  demands has been delivered in an adapted format (All-Day Group Triple P) at the Child and Family Psychology Clinic, the University of Queensland. All-Day Group Triple P consists of an 8-h all-day group followed by 4 weekly telephone calls, which is a more time-efficient and convenient delivery format for s. This service-based evaluation examines the effectiveness of the Group Triple P when delivered as an all-day group followed by four telephone calls. Retrospective pre-post data from 2001 to 2011 collected during service delivery was analyzed. Participants were 159 mothers and 144 fathers. Significant improvements in  problems,  , al adjustment, and al disagreement were reported, with no improvement in al relationship quality. Reliable and clinically significant improvements were demonstrated, and high levels of program satisfaction reported. This  highlights the potential benefits of providing more convenient and efficient services in order to reach more families in need."
"A Longitudinal Study of Authoritative Parenting, Juvenile Delinquency and Crime Victimization among Chinese Adolescents",2020,"Empirical  on the relationship between authoritative  and crime victimization has been sparse, although this  of  has been identified as an effective  practice for inhibiting offending behavior among  and adolescents. The current  aims at filling this gap by examining the influences of authoritative  on juvenile delinquency and crime victimization, as well as the mechanisms connecting the processes. Using two-wave survey data collected from a probability sample of 1066 Chinese adolescents, the current  employed a structural equation modeling analysis to test the relationships. The  indicated that authoritative  negatively predicted juvenile delinquency and crime victimization. Further, adolescent mental health problems and delinquent peer association partially mediated the influence of authoritative  on delinquency, while adolescent mental health problems, delinquent peer association, and juvenile delinquency fully mediated the relationship between authoritative  and crime victimization. The   showed that juvenile delinquency positively predicted future crime victimization. Overall, this  demonstrated that authoritative  operated as a protective factor against juvenile delinquency and crime victimization."
Short stature in hood and adolescence: psychopathology and family educational style,2021,"Having short stature (stunting) during hood or adolescence may be associated with increased clinical distress and depression. Factors such as  , gender, age, treatment, hospitalizations and height of the adolescent and s may influence adjustment. The aim was to  personal and family variables that are associated with less clinical anxiety, depression and emotional distress. A total of 168 adolescents with TB aged 9-17 years (M=12.09; S/32.07) participated, 60.10%. They were assessed using an ad hoc register, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the al Styles Scale. Descriptive analyses, Student's t-tests for independent samples, effect size calculation, Pearson correlations and hierarchical regressions were performed. Results showed that positive family  and fewer hospitalizations were associated with fewer anxious and depressive symptoms. Girls and those who had been diagnosed with TB for a longer period of time showed greater communication with their family. Younger adolescents showed worse perception of  . Age, medical treatment and height were not related to psychological adjustment. In the prediction of anxious and depressive symptoms and emotional distress, a greater number of hospitalizations and less promotion of autonomy and behavioural control were relevant. We highlight the importance of family variables in the adjustment of adolescents with TB."
Gradient of association between parenting styles and patterns of drug use in adolescence: A latent class analysis,2017,"Background: To identify different patterns of drug use in adolescence and determine if these are associated with   and other sociodemographic factors. Methods: A latent class analysis was conducted using baseline data collected in a sample (n = 6381) from a randomized controlled trial conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the #Tamojunto drug-use prevention program, carried out with 7th- and 8th-grade public school students in six Brazilian cities. Results: Three latent classes were identified among the students: 1) abstainers/low users (81.54%), 2) alcohol users/binge drinkers (16.65%), and 3) polydrug users (1.80%). A gradient of inverse association was found between   (authoritative, authoritarian, and indulgent, with the neglectful  as a reference point) and the classes alcohol users/binge drinkers (aOR = 0.36, 95%CI = 0.27-0.47; aOR = 0.56, 95%CI = 0.43-0.72; and aOR = 0.64, 95%CI = 0.51-0.80, respectively) and polydrug users (aOR = 0.09, 95%CI = 0.03-0.24; aOR = 0.23, 95%CI = 0.11-0.52; and aOR = 0.24, 95%CI = 0.08-0.74, respectively). Associations were  revealed between the latent classes and the adolescent's age and socioeconomic status. Conclusion: The  suggest that activities to develop  skills should be included in school programs aimed at the prevention of drug use among adolescents in order to reduce neglectful practices and thereby possibly reduce drug use among the ."
"Researching Parental Socialization Styles across Three Cultural Contexts: Scale ESPA29 Bi-Dimensional Validity in Spain, Portugal, and Brazil",2019,"Recent  that relates  with adolescent adjustment has shown the importance of considering the cultural context of the relationship. New  are emerging when considering the classical four-typologies model of al socialization in some European and South-American countries. Among the instruments used in this emergent  is the al Socialization Scale ESPA29. This scale is a bi-dimensional  instrument that was specifically developed to measure the four  typologies, through the dimensions of acceptance/involvement and strictness/imposition. This  examines the good fit of the orthogonal bi-factor model based on the ESPA29 versus one-dimensional and bi-dimensional oblique alternative models, with three adolescent samples from 12 to 17 years old (53.4% girls), from Spain (N = 826), Portugal (N = 752), and Brazil (N = 628). We applied structural equation models (SEMs) to analyze the fit of the models to the data. The  confirm a better fit to the data for the orthogonal bi-factor model versus one-dimensional and bi-dimensional oblique alternative models across country, adolescent sex, and the three age groups. Additionally, the convergent validity of the scale was proved by showing the relation of the two  dimensions with self-concept. The  guarantee the adequacy of the ESPA29 to measure  ."
Depressive symptoms in Chinese elementary school :  social-cognitive factors and parenting factors,2016,"This  examined  cognitive-behavioural factors and  factors related to hood depressive symptoms. Results indicate that positive and negative attributional  were protective and vulnerable factors of depression symptoms, respectively, and the attribution-depression link was mediated by self-esteem and coping responses. Children who inclined to explain positive outcomes with internal, stable and global factors reported higher self-esteem which predicted adopting seeking social support but not internalization and externalization coping responses. These  reported less depressive symptoms. In contrast,  who explained negative events with internal, stable and global causes developed lower self-esteem and adopted internalization and externalization coping responses which predicted depression in the positive direction. Authoritative   and al anxiety predicted  depressive symptoms in the negative and positive directions, respectively. The current  solicit the attention of school personnel and professionals to the importance of fostering self-esteem and adaptive attributional  and coping responses in ."
The association between 's Behavior and Parenting of caregivers: a longitudinal study in Japan,2016,"The purpose of this  was to elucidate the association between 's behavior (i.e., prosocial and problematic behavior) and the   (i.e., laxness and overreactivity) of their caregivers by using longitudinal data in the Japanese population. These data were collected when the  were 7.5 and 9 years. We proposed three hypotheses: 's behavior at 7.5 years will predict their behavior at 9 years; 's behavior at 7.5 years will predict the  of their caregivers; and the   of caregivers will affect their 's behavior at 9 years. We evaluated 's behavior and  behavior using a strength and difficulties questionnaire and a  scale. The hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). The  of the SEM showed that 's behavior at 7.5 years predicted their behavior at 9 years. Children's problematic behavior at 7.5 years triggered over-reactive  in their caregivers at 9 years, which increased problematic behavior and decreased prosocial behavior in the  at 9 years. These findings indicate the association between 's behavior and the   of caregivers in Japan."

The socio-materiality of parental style Negotiating the multiple affordances of parenting and  welfare within the new  surveillance technology market,2016,"Purpose - This  aims to offer understanding of the  -  relationship by examining, through a socio-material lens, how one aspect of the new  surveillance technology market,  GPS trackers (CGT), are rejected or adopted by families, highlighting implications for  welfare, privacy and 's rights policy. Design/methodology/approach - The authors gathered netnographic data from a range of online sources ( forums, online product reviews, discussion boards) that captured al views towards the use of CGT and stories of the technology in use and theorize the data through application of a novel combination of neutralisation and affordance theory. Findings - The  reveals how critics of CGT highlight the negative affordances of such product use (highlighting the negative agency of the technology). al adopters of CGT, in turn, attempt to rationalize their use of the technology as a mediator in the  -  relation through utilisation of a range of neutralisation mechanisms which re-afford positive product agency. Implications for  welfare and policy are discussed in the light of those findings. Originality/value - The paper s an empirical, qualitative understanding of s negotiating the emergence of a controversial new -related technology - CGT - and its impact upon debates in the field of  and hood; develops the theory of al  towards al affordances, using a socio-material theoretical lens to augment existing sociological approaches; and contributes to the debates surrounding  welfare, ethics, privacy and human rights in the context of  surveillance GPS technologies."

It is about a descriptive and correlational exploratory  with twelve bial families with a five to seven years old , at least. Two instruments were used: the Co Relationships Scale (CRS) and the  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ). A descriptive and correlational statistic was used by the SPSS 18.0 statistical package. Results had shown that validation (endorsement) of the partner's  appeared as a relevant factor in  . The more mothers reported to endorse the hood of their spouses, the more they mentioned the use of a democratic reciprocal . The validation by mothers was positively related to coal support: the more they realized the support of their husbands, the more they endorsed their . The coal sabotage had a positive relationship with the use of a permissive  (lack of firmness) for both.

Parenting Style and the Vulnerable Child Syndrome,2009,"TOPIC: Vulnerable  syndrome (VCS) refers to the combination of the al view that their  is at increased risk for death despite the 's objective health and the ing behavior problems in the . Although risk factors for the development of the syndrome have been outlined, the variability in the development of VCS has not been explained. PURPOSE: A theoretical explanation for the variability in the development of VCS utilizing Susan Calkins' model is explored. By considering the development of VCS in light of Calkins' model, variability may be explained and preventative interventions may be instituted. SOURCES USED: Relevant literature pertaining to  development and VCS was reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: By recognizing the risk of the role that  sensitivity plays in the development of VCS, team-based interventions involving a developmental approach may be employed, and the long-term behavioral sequelae of the disorder may be prevented or alleviated.

Effect of Parenting and Peer Stressors on Cognitive Vulnerability and Risk for Depression among Youth,2018," behaviors influence clinical depression among youth, but little is known about the developmental processes that may account for this association. This  investigated whether  is associated with the onset of clinical depression and depressive symptoms through negative cognitive , particularly under conditions of high exposure to stressors, in a community sample of  and adolescents (N = 275; 59% girls). Observational methods were used to assess positive and negative  during a laboratory social-evaluative stressor task. Depressive symptoms and clinical depressive episodes were repeatedly assessed over an 18-month prospective follow-up period. Results supported a conditional indirect effect in which low levels of observed positive  during a youth stressor task were indirectly associated with an increased likelihood of experiencing an episode of depression and worsening depressive symptoms over the course of the  through youth negative cognitive , but only for youth who  experienced a high number of peer stressors. These findings elucidate mechanisms through which problematic  may contribute to risk for the development of clinical depression during the transition into and across adolescence. Implications for depression interventions are discussed."
"The relationship between parenting attitudes, negative cognition, and the depressive symptoms according to gender in Korean adolescents",2016,"Background:   is one potential contributor to the development of adolescents' cognitions, self-esteem and emotional problems. This  examined the relationship between maternal  attitudes and adolescents' negative cognitions, and depressive symptoms according to gender. Methods: A total of 401 middle and high school students were recruited (i.e. 221 males and 180 females; mean age, 13.92 +/- 1.31 years). The Maternal Behavior Research Instrument assessed maternal  attitudes. Analyses examined the relationship between  attitudes and affective symptoms, with self-esteem and negative automatic thoughts as mediators of these relations. Results: Maternal rejecting attitudes were positively associated with depressive symptoms via increasing negative autonomic thoughts and decreasing self-esteem among female adolescents. Among male adolescents, maternal rejecting attitudes were associated with low self-esteem, but they were not associated with depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Maternal  has a larger impact on the emotional adjustment of females compared to males. Interventions to increase self-esteem and correct negative cognitions may be helpful for depressed female adolescents, specifically for those whose mothers are rejecting."
Relationship between parenting attitudes and 's pre-school education attainment level,2007," attitudes is one of the important factors in  education.

Also, the data showed that there is a negative correlation between the types of  attitudes and pre-school education attainment level. However, it was found out that there is no significant relation between democratic  attitudes and 's pre-school education attainment levels. It was revealed that the s of , who had longer pre-school education attainment, had the highest level of  attitude scores. Finally, it was found that  attitudes did not change according to the sex of the ."
The role of parenting styles and alcohol expectancies in teen binge drinking: A preliminary investigation among Italian adolescents and their parents,2013,"As adolescents' alcohol abuse is more widespread almost everywhere, the aim of this  was to better understand the influence of both alcohol expectancies and   on this risky behaviour in order to allow the development of future prevention programmes, by evaluating the correlation between these variables. A total of 1500 subjects participated in this : 500 high school students were asked to complete different questionnaires concerning their consumption attitude, and their beliefs on alcohol, whereas their s (N = 1000) were asked to evaluate  . According to previous studies, the sample was classified into non-drinkers, social, binge and heavy drinkers. Consistent with the hypothesis, statistical analysis showed that both alcohol expectancies and   significantly differ within these groups, thus being powerful predictors of high-risk drinking patterns."
Parenting Values and Practices among Muslim Parents in Indonesia,2012,"Despite the fact that Muslims are fast becoming part of the world population, they are the least known group. Moreover, Muslims have been seriously misunderstood and negatively perceived because of several tragic events related to terrorist attacks or wars in the Middle East countries. In this light, the current  examined how  values and practices varied by importance of religion, gender, and generation, based on the questionnaire data collected from 312 Muslim fathers and mothers living in Jakarta, Indonesia. The most salient  of this  was that the religion was at the center of everyday lives. The importance of religion in their lives clearly translated in their   by engaging in religious practices with their . At the same time, Muslim s in Indonesia had a high level of expectation for their 's education and making happy family life as well as being faithful as Muslim. This  contributed to promoting cultural sensitivity towards Muslims by examining Indonesian Muslim s'  values and practices."
Gratification Delay and Parenting Behaviour: A Study on Pre-School Children,2015,"This  examined gratification delay and  behaviour among the preschoolers. Maternal -rearing approaches have been identified as important in the development of 's capacity to delay gratification (e.g., Olson et al., 1990; Vaughn et al., 1984). The participants in the  were divided into two subgroups of 'success' and 'failures' with the help of an activity planned on the basis of the famous 'Stanford Marshmallow Experiment' (Mischel et al., 1972). A self report of maternal   was obtained. A behavioral checklist was  filled up by the mother and the teacher of these subjects. The  indicated a significant difference in the  of preschoolers who could delay gratification and those who could not. Significant difference was  obtained in the disruptive behaviour exhibited by the two groups of preschoolers as rated by their teachers and mothers."
Coercive Parenting and Adolescent Developmental Outcomes: The Moderating Effects of Empathic Concern and Perception of Social Rejection,2020,"Previous studies have identified coercive  as a prevalent   in Chinese society. They suggested that this  of  could promote prosocial behavior and school commitment when combined with close monitoring and proper training, but it could  undermine mental health. This  critically examines these claims. Based on the existing theory and , it is predicted that the influences of coercive  on adolescent development vary according to adolescent personal attributes including empathic concern and perception of social rejection. Through the analysis of two-wave survey data collected from a probability sample of 1085 Chinese adolescents, this  found that adolescents with higher levels of empathic concern and perceived social rejection reported less delinquency and stronger school commitment than their peers with lower levels of such attributes, when coercive  was low to moderate. However, under the condition of excessive coercive control, these adolescents demonstrated more delinquency and weaker school commitment. Empathic concern and perception of social rejection, on the other hand, played no or limited role in moderating the relationship between coercive  and depression. These  suggest that the influences of coercive  are dynamic and are subject to change as they interact with adolescent personal characteristics across different developmental domains."
Aggression in toddlers: Associations with parenting and marital relations,2001,"This  examined the relation among  factors, marital relations, and toddler aggression. A structured questionnaire was administered to both s of 254 2-year-olds. The authors used correlation and hierarchical multiple regression analyses to assess the extent to which certain personality traits, drug use,  , and marital conflicts were related to the toddlers' aggressive behavior. Results showed that the maternal -rearing and al aggression domains had a direct effect on toddler aggression. The domain of maternal  rearing  served as a mediator for the domains of marital relations, paternal  rearing, al aggression, and al drug use. The findings indicated that maternal -rearing practices, personality attributes, and drug use were more important than paternal attributes in relation to toddler aggression. Implications for prevention among families at risk are discussed."

Developmental pathways in adolescents representations of their relationship to mother and links to mothers parenting,2007,"The purpose of this  was to identify and compare different developmental pathways in adolescents' reations of their relationship to mother and to test how these trajectories can be predicted by mothers' supportive  as perceived by adolescents and mothers. Data come from 228 adolescents who were investigated four times between the years 1996 and 2002. Analyses consider insecurities in relation to mother as well as engulfment anxiety which reflects a distant and dismissing attitude. Semiparametric latent class analyses revealed for both aspects differential development pathways which could be predicted by maternal , partly by discrepancies in adolescents' and mothers ratings. Results show that nonwithstanding age-specific changes interindividual differences proved to be largely stable across adolescence."
"Overprotective Parenting, Social Anxiety, and External Locus of Control: Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Relationships",2009,"A relationship between social anxiety and a   marked by overprotection and low warmth has been repeatedly demonstrated (e.g., Bruch et al. in Anxiety Reaserch 2:57-65, 1989; Lieb et al. in Arch Gen Psychiatry 57:859-866, 2000). The current  supports the findings in the broader literature of a significant relationship between social anxiety and recollections of overprotective and cold  among college students. External locus of control partially mediated the relationship between overprotective  and social anxiety. However, these analyses used cross-sectional data, and an alternate mediational model was  significant, highlighting the various ways in which these factors interact. Finally, recollections of maternal overprotection predicted an increase in social anxiety during the first semester of college, suggesting their influence on current functioning."
Parenting priorities and pressures: furthering understanding of 'concerted cultivation',2016,"This paper re-examines the purposes of a planned and intentional   - 'concerted cultivation' - for different middle-class groups, highlighting that social class fraction, ethnicity, and  individual family disposition, guides understandings of the purposes of enrolling  in particular enrichment activities. We examine how s and their  engage in extra-curricular activities for instrumental reasons with a view to securing skills, qualities and distinction for the future. Additionally, however, enrichment activities are understood as offering -day values such as enjoyment, social bonding and purposeful activity. The paper  highlights that current policy and broader commercial discourses call for the increased responsibilisation and intensification of , which means that 'good' s are required to 'buy into' extra-curricular activities for their , with concomitant implications for those whose access to activities is limited by economic circumstance."
"Parenting, corpus callosum, and executive function in preschool ",2014,"In this longitudinal population-based  (N=544), we investigated whether early  and corpus callosum length predict  executive function abilities at 4 years of age. The length of the corpus callosum in infancy was measured using postnatal cranial ultrasounds at 6 weeks of age. At 3 years, two aspects of  were observed: maternal sensitivity during a teaching task and maternal discipline  during a discipline task. s rated executive function problems at 4 years of age in five domains of inhibition, shifting, emotional control, working memory, and planning/organizing, using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool Version. Maternal sensitivity predicted less executive function problems at preschool age. A significant interaction was found between corpus callosum length in infancy and maternal use of positive discipline to determine  inhibition problems: The association between a relatively shorter corpus callosum in infancy and  inhibition problems was reduced in  who experienced more positive discipline. Our  point to the buffering potential of positive  for  with biological vulnerability."
Racial differences in parenting dimensions and adolescent condom use at sexual debut,2006,"Objectives:   may be a determinant in reducing adolescent risk behavior. Previous studies have relied on a typological  approach, with classification into four groups: authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and neglectful. In this , two distinct  dimensions, demandingness and responsiveness, were examined as independent predictors of adolescent condom use. Design and Sample: This  used a subsample of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) that included 153 adolescent-mother pairs. Measurement: Maternal demandingness and responsiveness were measured using Wave I mother interviews. Logistic regression analyses were used to predict adolescent condom use at sexual debut at Wave II and to assess moderation by gender and race. Results: (1) Maternal demandingness predicted increased likelihood of condom use in African American adolescents but decreased likelihood of condom use in White adolescents; (2) maternal responsiveness did not predict condom use; and (3) gender moderation was not . Conclusions: To provide appropriate family counseling, public health nurses need to consider racial differences in contraceptive practices. Education regarding al supervision practices should be considered as part of nursing interventions intended to increase condom use in African American adolescents."
Psychometric Properties of the Interpersonal Mindfulness in Parenting Scale in a Sample of Portuguese Mothers,2017,"The Interpersonal Mindfulness in  scale (IM-P) is a self-report questionnaire for measuring mindful . The goal of this  was to explore the psychometric properties and factor structure of the Portuguese version of the IM-P. Three studies were conducted. The first  included 300 mothers of /adolescents, the second  included 323 mothers of /adolescents, and the third  included 237 mothers and 142 fathers of /adolescents. In  1, the exploratory factor analysis and the reliability analyses ed in a five-factor structure. Furthermore, the scale scores showed adequate internal consistency and correlated as expected with measures of self-compassion,  stress, and perceived stress, evidencing adequate convergent validity. In  2, the five-factor structure was confirmed through a confirmatory factor analysis. In  3, the construct validity of the scale (convergent and known-groups) was further explored. Significant correlations were found between the IM-P and measures of self-compassion,  , and anxious/depressive symptomatology. Mothers reported higher levels of compassion for the  and emotional awareness of the  but lower levels of non-judgmental acceptance of al functioning than fathers. This  demonstrated that mindful  can be measured through the assessment of five dimensions (Listening with Full Attention, Compassion for the Child, Non-judgmental Acceptance of al Functioning, Self-regulation in , and Emotional Awareness of the Child) and confirmed that the Portuguese version is an adequate measure of this construct."
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PARENTING STYLES AND YOUNG-ADULTS SELF-CONCEPTS AND EVALUATIONS OF PARENTS,1992,"In the  , 123 college students were surveyed in order to assess their self-concepts, evaluations of s, and perceptions of their s'  . Notably, the students' self-concepts were found to vary directly with perceived level of al warmth, but did not vary as a function of their s' level of restrictiveness. Fathers and mothers were found to be rated more highly if they were perceived as being warm and permissive rather than hostile and restrictive. Finally, opposite-sex s' level of warmth  correlated with how each  was evaluated. Some explanations for these findings are offered."
Parenting Infants: Socialization Goals and Behaviors of Italian Mothers and Immigrant Mothers From West Africa,2013,"This  was aimed at contributing to the understanding of cultural  strategies in a context of immigration. Socialization goals (SGs) and  behaviors during interaction with 3-month-old infants of first-generation West African immigrant mothers in Italy and autochthonous Italian mothers were compared. The relation between SGs and maternal behaviors within the two groups was  examined. As expected,  showed that West African immigrant mothers placed more emphasis on SGs related to hierarchical relatedness and a proximal   than Italian mothers, who emphasized SGs related to psychological autonomy and a distal  . Although there were no significant differences in the amount of overall vocal/verbal behaviors between the two samples, West African immigrant mothers showed longer durations of rhythmic vocalizing and singing than Italian mothers, who showed more affectionate talking. Compared with the literature on West African  strategies, this  suggests a possible increased amount of talking of immigrant mothers in the new language-driven environment, but maintenance of a protosong structure typical of their culture of origin. Furthermore, a significant association between socialization goals and  behaviors was found in the Italian group of mothers but not in the sample of immigrant mothers, suggesting that the weaker links between goals and behaviors in the immigrant sample may express a reorganization in the composition of  beliefs and practices."
Is a Pejorative View of Power Assertion in the Socialization Process Justified?,2013,"Power assertion is foundational to the authoritative   and the authoritative   is consistently acknowledged to be optimal so that a pejorative view of power assertion per se is unwarranted. In contrast to the -centered presumption that power assertion by s is detrimental to the well-being of  and bears an antinomian relation to reasoning, I argue that reasoning and confrontive power assertion are independent processes that, when synthesized, account for the benefits of authoritative  relative to the other primary   (authoritarian, permissive, disengaged) in which either or both confrontive power assertion and reasoning are minimal. Directive , a newly identified power-assertive   that is as demanding as the authoritarian , but is not arbitrary, hostile, or punitive, has  been found to be beneficial."
Six Dimensions of Parenting: A Motivational Model,2005,"Objective. A motivational conceptualization provided the basis for identifying 6 core features of   (warmth, rejection, structure, chaos, autonomy support, and coercion) and constructing 2 measures to assess them (1 for s and 1 for ). Design. Self-report data were collected from independent samples of s (N = 1212, 645 mothers and 567 fathers) and adolescent  (N = 3,752). Results. Models of multiple (unipolar) dimensions provided a significantly better fit than traditional models of bipolar dimensions. Moreover, correlations among dimensions suggested that dimensions can be aggregated in several ways. Conclusion. The conceptual framework and measures can contribute to future work on , including  designed to map the many constructs that describe , and studies that explore how   shapes  and adolescent outcomes."
Maladaptive personality styles in a clinical sample of women with postpartum depression,2020,"Background: Personally traits are associated with the onset and course of postpartum depression. The impact of maladaptive personality traits on mother- bonding and  is less studied. Therefore, the aims of this  are to investigate: a) the frequency of maladaptive personality  in women with postpartum depression; b) the association between personality  and the course of maternal psychopathology; and c) the association between personality  and mother- bonding and  competence. Methods: We examined n = 123 patients of a mother-baby unit with the Personality Style and Disorder Inventory (PSSI) at admission and instruments assessed maternal psychopathological symptoms (BSI), mother bonding (PBQ), and  sense of competence (PSOC) at admission and discharge. Results: Maladaptive personality  were frequent. Women with postpartum depression had higher scores on the schizoid, avoidant, obsessive-compulsive, negativistic, dependent, borderline, depressive, and self-forgetting PSSI scales than women of the general population. The presence of maladaptive personality  was associated with higher psychopathology, impaired mother- bonding, and lower  sense of competence at admission. From admission to discharge, women showed significant improvements on psychopathology, bonding and  irrespective of the presence of maladaptive personality . However, mothers with maladaptive personally  still had higher psychopathology and impaired mother- bonding at discharge compared to mothers with normal PSSI scores. Limitations: Data is based upon a clinical sample of women hospitalized in a mother- unit. Results are not reative for all women with postpartum depression. Conclusions: Our  underline the need for early identification of maladaptive personality  and for the adequate treatment and monitoring of women with postpartum depression. It can be anticipated that women suffering from maladaptive personally  will need ongoing care to prevent long-term negative outcomes."
"Effects of a Foster Parent Training Intervention on Child Behavior, Caregiver Stress, and Parenting Style",2016,"Findings from Maryland KEEP, a replication of KEEP (keeping foster and kinship s trained and supported), a foster and kinship  training intervention are ed. The purposes of this  were to evaluate  behavior change, changes in caregiver  , and permanency and placement stability at baseline and then after the KEEP intervention. The KEEP intervention was provided to 65 foster and kinship s providing care for  ages 4-12. Children who participated in the  were referred due to behavior problems, as reported by foster s: they all scored in the clinical range for externalizing behavior on the  behavior checklist (CBCL). Baseline and posttest analyses assessed for  behavior and   changes. Permanency data, including placement moves and exits from  welfare were examined. Overall, foster and kinship s reported significantly fewer  behavior problems at posttest; severity levels on the CBCL decreased from baseline to posttest and scores on the  Daily Report decreased from 7.25 at baseline to 3.0 at posttest.

Gendered Parenting in Early Childhood: Subtle But Unmistakable if You Know Where to Look,2018,"Gendered  refers to al messages and behaviors that convey information about how girls and boys are supposed to behave. In this article, we show that although gendered socialization is rarely found in broad   or explicit  practices, it is  in implicit  practices. Such implicit practices can be directed to the  (direct messages) and take the form of exposing  to different products and responding to 's behaviors differently depending on gender. Implicit gendered  practices can  be directed to others or reflect general gendered expressions that are conveyed to the  (indirect messages); these can take the form of gendered evaluations of others' behaviors in the 's presence and modeling gendered roles. We argue that ing these subtle forms of gendered  is important to understand gendered  development in light of the changing societal backdrop of gender roles and values."
Exploration of Parents' Digital Parenting Efficacy through Several Demographic Variables,2019,"As digital technologies develop, they provide individuals with new opportunities in various areas of daily life. However, these technologies  bring about some potential risks. Through digital technologies, several risks including but not limited to malicious content, cyberbullying, pornography, and sexually-explicit messages can easily reach out to households. The most vulnerable group for such risks is the . As s are primarily responsible for the well-being of their , they have an important role in protecting the  in the digital environment. s need to get acquainted with the digital age so that they could protect their  from the risks pertaining to the use of digital technologies. The purpose of this  was twofold: (a) to identify digital  efficacy domains and their indicators, and (b) to examine s' efficacy levels in terms of some demographic variables through a measure based on the identified indicators. The  was survey  with two phases. In the first phase, based on a literature review and a focus group interview with experts, digital  efficacy fields and their indicators were identified. In the second phase, a digital  self-efficacy scale was developed and administered to 576 s in Eskisehir region to explore the participants' self-efficacy levels based on  roles, internet use, income level, occupation, and educational level. The digital  competencies and their indicators used in the scale development process consisted of seven dimensions. Through the participation of separate samples of s, the factorial structure of the scale was examined through exploratory (n=520) and confirmatory factor analyses (n=556). After construct validity steps, indicators were gathered under three factors as digital literacy, digital safety, and digital communication. These indicators did not differ based on s' role in the process, internet use, socio-economic status, occupation, and level of education."
The Relationship Between Neighborhood Characteristics and Effective Parenting Behaviors: The Role of Social Support,2012,"Neighborhood characteristics have been linked to healthy behavior, including effective  behaviors. This may be partially explained through the neighborhood's relation to s' access to social support from friends and family. The current  examined associations of neighborhood characteristics with  behaviors indirectly through social support. The sample included 614 mothers of 11- to 12-year-old youths enrolled in a health care system in the San Francisco area. Structural equations modeling shows that neighborhood perceptions were related to  behaviors, indirectly through social support, whereas archival census neighborhood indicators were unrelated to social support and . Perceived neighborhood social cohesion and control were related to greater social support, which was related to more effective  , - communication, and monitoring. Perceived neighborhood disorganization was unrelated to social support. Prevention strategies should focus on helping s build a social support network that can act as a resource in times of need."
"Parenting practices, aggressive response evaluation and decision, and social difficulties in kindergarten : The role of fathers",2021,"The association between fathers'  characteristics and their preschool 's social information processing (SIP) patterns is an understudied  topic. Hence, the current  aims to bridge this gap by examining whether there are differences between mothers' and fathers'  characteristics and their 's SIP patterns as well as their social functioning in school, with a specific focus on 's aggressive response evaluation and decision (RED) and social difficulties in kindergarten. Using a multimethod (self-reports and direct assessments) multi-informant (mother, father, , and teacher) design, we collected data from 115 kindergarten , their mothers, and their fathers, tapping the s' perceptions of the relationships with the  and  ; the 's aggressively biased RED, and the 's social difficulties in kindergarten. We found that fathers'  capacities are associated with 's aggressively biased RED, whereas no such associations were found for mothers. In addition, aggressively biased RED mediated the association between fathers' authoritative   and the 's maladaptive behavior in kindergarten. There were no differences between fathers and mothers in relation to social difficulties in kindergarten, with both s' authoritative   associated with less social difficulties. However, sex moderated this association in mothers as their authoritative  was associated with social difficulties in boys but not in girls. This difference was not found in fathers. On the other hand, fathers' authoritarian   was associated with aggressive RED in boys but not in girls. The tentative nature of these findings and the need for replications are discussed."

Children diagnosed as Combined or Predominantly Hyperactive Impulsive Type had significantly higher scores than those diagnosed as Predominantly Inattentive Type in anxious and avoidant attachment, emotionality, and activity dimensions of temperament, and their s reported higher levels of controlling . Hierarchic regressions indicated that al promotion of autonomy with  with temperamental emotionality predicted anxious attachment, while al restriction of autonomy with  with high levels of temperamental activity predicted avoidant attachment."
Pediatrician Identification of Child Behavior Problems: The Roles of Parenting Factors and Cross-Practice Differences,2012,"While most primary care pediatricians acknowledge the importance of identifying  behavior problems, fewer than 2% of  with a diagnosable psychological disorder are referred for mental health care in any given year. The   examined the potential role of al characteristics (al affect,  , and  self-efficacy) in pediatrician identification of  behavior problems, and determined whether these relationships differed across practices. s of 831  between 2 and 16 years completed questionnaires regarding demographic information, their 's behavior, their affect, their  , and their  self-efficacy. Pediatricians completed a brief questionnaire following visits in four community-based primary care practices in the Midwest. Logistic regressions controlling for  behavior and demographic predictors of pediatrician identification found that an authoritarian  , in which s yell or strongly negatively react to problem behavior, was negatively associated with likelihood of identification in the overall sample. However, the variables that were predictive of pediatrician identification differed depending on the specific practice. al characteristics can aid in understanding which  are likely to be identified by their pediatrician as having behavioral problems. The finding that practices differed on which variables were associated with pediatrician identification suggests the need to potentially individualize interventions to certain physicians and practices to improve identification of  behavior problems in primary care."
Mindful Parenting Assessed in Mainland China: Psychometric Properties of the Chinese Version of the Interpersonal Mindfulness in Parenting Scale,2019,"ObjectivesThe Interpersonal Mindfulness in  Scale is a 31-item self-report measure to assess mindful , and has been revised into a Dutch, Portuguese, and Hong Kong version. The aim of this  was to explore the factor structure and psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Interpersonal Mindfulness in  scale (IM-P-C) in Mainland China.MethodsThe Chinese version was translated from the original English version in the preliminary . Exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and measurement invariance analysis across gender, test-retest reliability were examined consecutively in  1 (n=183), 2 (n=294), and 3 (n=48). In  4, its factor structure was examined in a clinical sample (n=288).ResultsA four-factor structure was found in  1 and the scale scores showed adequate internal consistency. The four-factor structure was confirmed with a new sample in  2. Measurement invariance analysis across gender suggested that both fathers and mothers interpreted the IM-P-C in a similar manner. Significant correlations were found between the IM-P-C and measures of over-reactivity, al warmth, anxiety, depression, life satisfaction, and dispositional mindfulness. In  3,  exhibited temporal stability over a period of 2weeks. In  4, the IM-P-C was validated in s of  with autism.ConclusionsThe   demonstrated that mindful  in a Chinese population can be measured through the assessment of four dimensions (Interacting with Full Attention, Compassion and Acceptance, Self-regulation in , Emotional Awareness of Child) and confirmed that the Chinese version is an adequate measure for the studies of mindful  in Mainland China."
"Impact of Chinese Parenting on Adolescents' Social Bonding, Affiliation with Delinquent Peers, and Delinquent Behavior",2017,"Using data collected from 615 middle- and high-school students in rural and urban areas in China, this  examines how different   such as warmth, coercion, monitoring, and permissiveness affect 's delinquent behavior, both directly and indirectly through bonds with conventional others (i.e., s, school, and peers) and affiliation with delinquent peers. The  show that only al coercion has a direct effect on delinquency. All  , except for al monitoring, affect delinquency indirectly through mediating processes of social control and social learning in predicted directions. Despite different pathways to delinquency, variables of social control and social learning play an important role in mediating the relationship between  and delinquency. The implications of the  are discussed."
Parenting attitudes and 's understanding of mind - A comparison of Korean American and Anglo-American families,2001,"This  explores the relationship between maternal  attitudes and 's understanding of mind through a comparison of Korean American and Anglo-American families. It was hypothesized that  of authoritative mothers would perform better on theory-of-mind tasks than  of authoritarian families. Understanding of mind was assessed for 45 Korean American  and 52 Anglo-American  from ages 3 to 6. Mothers of the  completed a  Attitudes Inventory (PAI), which measured three aspects of   -a focus on behavioral control, freedom in learning, and encouragement of autonomy. Korean American mothers were generally authoritarian, though not exclusively so, and their 5-year-olds performed better on the theory-of-mind tasks than their Anglo-American agemates. For Anglo-American , a negative relationship between an understanding of mind and authoritarian  attitudes was found. A general positive effect of authoritative  was not found. These  suggest that the same developmental endpoint can be reached in different cultures by different means, and that what constitutes 'good ' depends on a complex of attitudes and behaviors that can only be understood in their sociocultural context, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Does Strength-Based Parenting Predict Academic Achievement? The Mediating Effects of Perseverance and Engagement,2019,"Strength-based  (SBP) is a  of  characterized by knowledge and encouragement of a 's unique personality, abilities, talents, and skills (i.e., strengths). Recent studies have demonstrated a unique contribution of SBP, above other  , in predicting a range of wellbeing indicators in adolescents. Given that wellbeing supports learning, and SBP predicts wellbeing, it is  plausible that adolescents with strength-based s will have greater academic achievement. At the beginning of term, students from a public secondary school in Australia (N=741, M-age=13.70, SD=1.33; 50% female) completed a self-report survey measuring perceptions of al , engagement, and perseverance. Subsequent academic  were obtained 3months later. SBP predicted higher wellbeing in the form of adolescent engagement and perseverance. SBP  demonstrated a significant effect on academic achievement which was mediated by perseverance, but not engagement. Thus,  supported a model in which adolescents with strength-based s achieved higher grades via increased perseverance. Results reaffirm the importance of the -student link, and dispositional qualities of engagement and perseverance, in predicting educational outcomes such as grades. This  extends positive education  beyond the classroom by demonstrating that positive  techniques like SBP can predict student wellbeing and academic achievement."
"Parenting practices, interpretive biases, and anxiety in Latino ",2013,"A number of factors are believed to confer risk for anxiety development in ; however, cultural variation of purported risk factors remains unclear. We examined relations between controlling-and rejecting  , al modeling of anxious behaviors,  interpretive biases, and  anxiety in a mixed clinically anxious (n = 27) and non-clinical (n = 20) sample of Latino  and at least one of their s. Families completed discussion-based tasks and questionnaires in a lab setting. Results indicated that  anxiety was: linked with al control and  interpretative biases, associated with al modeling of anxious behaviors at a trend level, and not associated with low al acceptance. Findings that controlling  and  interpretive biases were associated with anxiety extend current theories of anxiety development to the Latino population. We speculate that strong family ties may buffer Latino  from detrimental effects of perceived low al acceptance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
A Qualitative Study of the Impact of Spousal Death on Changed Parenting Practices of Iranian Single-Parent Widows,2010,"Background: While it is expected, different causes to decision making accept  responsibility and   based on the single hood occurs as a  death of the spouse, it has not been clearly articulated. Therefore, we explored the  experiences of Iranian single- widows who keep custody of their  after their spouses die. Method: In this descriptive, exploratory  in-depth interviews were held with 24 Iranian single- widows. The data generated were analyzed using the constant comparative method. Result: Preliminary  indicated four main thematic categories: (a) development of a paradoxical identity: a hopeless widow vs. a hopeful mother, (b) submerging self in custody role vs. staying from widow role, (c) sentimental  and, (d) paradoxical evaluation: fruitful for  vs. fruitless for self. Conclusion: The  indicate that single- after the death of the spouse is a difficult experience. Sentimental  practices, related to maladjustment with spousal death and roles transformation is a risk for the health of widow-single s, so they need to be supported by health care delivery and social welfare systems to cope with their life after spousal death."
"Beyond Deficits: Intimate Partner Violence, Maternal Parenting, and Child Behavior Over Time",2014,"Exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) has negative consequences for 's well-being and behavior. Much of the  on  in the context of IPV has focused on whether and how IPV victimization may negatively shape maternal , and how  may in turn negatively influence  behavior, ing in a deficit model of mothering in the context of IPV. However, extant  has yet to untangle the interrelationships among the constructs and test whether the negative effects of IPV on  behavior are indeed attributable to IPV affecting mothers' . The current  employed path analysis to examine the relationships among IPV, mothers'  practices, and their 's externalizing behaviors over three waves of data collection among a sample of 160 women with physically abusive partners. Findings indicate that women who reported higher levels of IPV  reported higher levels of behavior problems in their  at the next time point. When  practices were examined individually as mediators of the relationship between IPV and  behavior over time, one type of  was significant relationship, such that IPV lead to higher authoritative  and lower  behavior problems. On the other hand, there was no evidence that higher levels of IPV contributed to more  behavior problems due to maternal . Instead, IPV had a significant cumulative indirect effect on  behavior via the stability of both IPV and behavior over time. Implications for promoting women's and 's well-being in the context of IPV are discussed."
Poverty and Child Behavioral Problems: The Mediating Role of Parenting and Parental Well-Being,2017,"The detrimental impact of poverty on  behavioral problems is well-established, but the mechanisms that explain this relationship are less well-known. Using data from the Families in Germany Study on s and their  at ages 9-10 (middle hood), this  extends previous  by examining whether or not and to what extent different   and s' subjective well-being explain the relationship between poverty and  behavior problems. The  show that certain  , such as psychological control, as well as mothers' life satisfaction partially mediate the correlation between poverty and  behavioral problems."
Styles of parent- interactions in families with preschool-age ,2015,"With regard to cultural-historical and activity approaches, collaborative activity with an adult, including communication as a type of meta-activity, is considered to be the necessary mechanism of  development. A  is considered to be an active partner, possessing his/her own motives, and is guided by mental reations of the  and interactions with him/her. Russian psychologists have developed a range of   classifications; however, these  primarily emphasize a 's position, contrary to methodological perspectives, with inadequate consideration of a 's own agency. The aims of the current  were to investigate actual goaloriented interactions between preschoolers and their s and to outline certain patterns (types) of interactions, considering both partners and analyzing interactions according to the activity model. A total of 75 - dyads ( aged from 4.6 years to 6.11 years) participated in collaborative activity trials in which the observational method was based on the activity approach. Cluster analysis (k-means clusterization) revealed five different groups of - dyads: conflictual, harmonious, distant and two-fold dominant (with dominant  or dominant ). Between-group comparisons (Mann-Whitney U test) showed significant differences in a range of parameters of activity and emotional components of interactions. The harmonious type of interactions is not prevalent, although subgroups with different types of domination are the most common, which may be attributed to cultural peculiarities. Domination-subordination misbalance does not seem to seriously distort the normal developmental trajectory; however, in cases of conflictual and distant dyads, interactional issues might hinder the course of goal-oriented activity, which might serve as a predictor for potential difficulties in further learning."
Attachment parenting among middle-class couples in Spain: gendered principles and labor divisions,,"The time that middle-class fathers and mothers devote to care activities has significantly increased over the last two decades in Spain. In a context of increasingly widespread intensive and -centred  , the attachment  movement draws on a gender-essentialist interpretation of attachment theory to prescribe a series of practices that place great pressure on women's time, minds and bodies. Such burdens are likely related to the gendered division of household roles, but this issue remains largely underexplored in . This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature by exploring the links between gendered interpretations of attachment  principles and gendered patterns of labour division. The methodological approach consists of 28 semistructured interviews conducted separately with mothers and fathers from heterosexual couples with professional or managerial jobs and  under three years of age. The findings show that the gender essentialist interpretation of the attachment relationship rather than the amount of attachment  performed seems more determinant of task segregation. Prolonged breastfeeding stands out as a major barrier to a more egalitarian division of tasks, even for couples who are critical of the gendered interpretation of the attachment figure."
Translation and Validation of a Chinese Version of the Mindfulness in Parenting Questionnaire (MIPQ),2019,"Objective: To translate the Mindfulness in  Questionnaire (MIPQ) into Standard Mandarin and then explore the reliability and validity of this newly translated measure in a large sample of Chinese middle school s. Methods: We translated the MIPQ using the forward-backward method and pilot tested it on a sample of s of adolescents (aged 12-16 years) in China. Following minor modifications, 1057 Chinese s (Mothers or Fathers) in two middle schools (one in the North and one in the South of China) completed the translated Chinese Mindfulness in  Questionnaire (C-MIPQ). To determine test-retest reliability 121 participants completed the C-MIPQ again 2 weeks later. In order to test convergent validity, 395 participants completed the Mindful Attention and Awareness Scale (MAAS),  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire-Short Version (PSDQ-short) and the Interpersonal Mindfulness in  Scale (IM-P). The Chinese Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS), Beck Depression Scale (BDI-13), and socioeconomic status (SES) were completed in order to test discriminant validity. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the two-factor model indicated in the original  was a good fit. The total score of the scale and the scores of the two dimensions ('Mindful discipline' and 'Being in the moment with the ') were significantly positively correlated with the total score of the MAAS, IM-P and the authoritative   in the PSDQ-short, demonstrating convergent validity. Discriminant validity was established as there was no difference in C-MIPQ sub-scale scores across any of the SES variables except for levels of education (s with higher education had higher scores on the 'being in the moment with the ' subscale). In addition, the C-MIPQ was negatively related to stress and depression. Cronbach's alpha of the total scale was 0.93 (and 0.88, 0.89 for the two dimensions of the C-MIPQ) indicating excellent internal consistency. Test-retest reliability was good (intra-class correlation of 0.83). Conclusion: This  is the first step toward establishing the psychometric properties of the C-MIPQ for measuring mindful  in s of adolescents aged 12-16 years; additional studies will be needed in order to test this further."
"Adult generativity and the socialization of adolescents: Relations to mothers' and fathers' parenting beliefs, styles, and practices",2001,"Mothers, fathers, and their adolescent  participated in two studies investigating the relations between Erikson's concept of generativity in adulthood and patterns of . Study 1 involved 77 mothers and 48 fathers of Ist-year university students; Study 2 was part of an investigation of socialization processes in 35 families with an adolescent, aged 14-18. al generative concern was assessed by the Loyola Generativity Scale (LGS) of McAdams and de St. Aubin (1992) in each . In both studies, mothers demonstrated positive relations between scores on the LGS and an authoritative  of , as well as between generativity and more positive, optimistic views of adolescent development. In Study 2, these more positive views in turn mediated some aspects of autonomy-fostering practices used with the adolescent. Variations in fathers' levels of generative concern were less consistently related to these indices of , however."
Rearing styles and psychopathology in  and adolescents with intellectual disability from Chile and Spain,2017,"The aims of our  were: a) to evaluate how   vary according to the presence of intellectual disability (ID) and between two cultures - Chile and Spain -; and to value their association with psychopathology. Participants were 236  and adolescents aged 8-14, who were classified in the following three groups according to the type of ID: with Down syndrome (DS), idiopathic intellectual disability (IID) or without disability. s answered a questionnaire on perceived rearing  and psychopathology. Our  showed that in Chile DS group perceived less overprotection. Clinical scores were associated with overprotection, rejection and the presence of ID. Moreover, the Chilean participants reported more depression and somatisation than the Spanish participants. We expect our findings will contribute to the prevention and intervention of unfavourable rearing  and psychopathology in ID."
Maternal early-life trauma and affective parenting style: the mediating role of HPA-axis function,2016,"A history of hood trauma is associated with increased risk for psychopathology and interpersonal difficulties in adulthood and, for those who have , impairments in  and increased risk of negative outcomes in offspring. Physiological and behavioral mechanisms are poorly understood. In the current , maternal history of hood trauma was hypothesized to predict differences in maternal affect and HPA axis functioning. Mother-infant dyads (N = 255) were assessed at 6 months postpartum. Mothers were videotaped during a 3-min naturalistic interaction, and their behavior was coded for positive, neutral, and negative affect. Maternal salivary cortisol was measured six times across the  visit, which  included an infant stressor paradigm. Results showed that hood trauma history predicted increased neutral affect and decreased mean cortisol in the mothers and that cortisol mediated the association between trauma history and maternal affect. Maternal depression was not associated with affective measures or cortisol. Results suggest that early hood trauma may disrupt the development of the HPA axis, which in turn impairs affective expression during mother-infant interactions in postpartum women. Interventions aimed at treating psychiatric illness in postpartum women may benefit from specific components to assess and treat trauma-related symptoms and prevent secondary effects on ."
Investigating Opinions of Mothers on Different Socioeconomic Status in Terms of Perceived Maternal Styles,2015,"Problem Statement: There are various environmental factors such as culture, socioeconomic status, family patterns, al personality, family size, and education system among others, which affect development of individuals. Especially in the hood period,   is an important variable in forming physical, emotional, cognitive, and social development.   affects the capacity of  to interact with others, psychological wellbeing, and life skills; therefore,   has increasingly been recognized for its importance in fostering 's social, emotional, and cognitive areas of development. In the literature, there are different types of categorizations of al , however, most the acceptable   are described as democratic, authoritative, and permissive. Purpose of the Study: The aim of this  is to investigate perceptions of the   of mothers who have  between 2-6 years old, depending on their socioeconomic status (upper, middle, or lower). Method: In this , a quantitative  method was used as the  design to collect and analyze the interpretations and meanings of mothers' perceptions for maternal  from their responses. In determining the  group, purposive sampling is a type of non-probability sampling technique has been applied. In this respect, within the  process, 20 mothers from upper, middle, and lower socioeconomic levels have been selected and interviewed by using a semi-structured interview form generated with regards to Baumrind's al model. Interviews were analyzed by content analysis and descriptive analysis. Findings and Results: Finding of analyses were held separately according to socioeconomic level. It was ed whether perceived maternal  differ depending on SES or not. Mothers from upper socioeconomic level reflect a democratic al . Mothers from all socioeconomic levels emphasise that there are rules for  to obey but only mothers in upper socioeconomic level make rules together with . All of the mothers in upper and middle socio-economic levels and some of mothers in the lower socioeconomic level report to explaining emotions toward behaviours of their . But when opinions of mothers are examined, it is seen that they do not use I language to express their emotions. Conclusion and Recommendations: Findings of the   are thought to be crucial in explaining maternal  over Baumrind's   based on the dimensions-unlike the other studies in literature-in the early hood period based on the SES of mothers. For further studies, it can be recommended that al  should be evaluated based on the  socialisation, practices, and beliefs, and furthermore, in preparing and implementing -education."
Attachment Styles of Parents with Alcohol Use Disorder and the Relation of Their Parenting Perception to Their Parenting Attitudes,2021,"Objective: Many neurobiological, genetic, environmental, and spiritual factors are involved in addiction etiology. This  aims to examine al perceptions, attachment , and al attitudes. Methods: This is a cross-sectional . Patients diagnosed with alcohol use disorder (AUD) were enrolled in the Addiction Clinic of the Erenkoy Mental Hospital. The structured clinical interview for DSM-5 (SCID-I) was applied, and the sociodemographic data form, Adult Attachment Style, Family Life and Child Rearing Attitude Scale, and  Attachment Scale were administered to the participants. Results: It was determined that 21.5% of participants had depressive episode and anxiety disorder diagnoses; 15.4% of participants had  with a history of psychiatric treatment; 16.9% had  with a history of alcohol/substance use. The avoidant attachment score average of individuals with APD was found to be higher. The positive perception of s participating in terms of care and protection toward their own s was significant in all subdimensions with secure attachment. When the -rearing attitudes of s with secure attachment were examined, the dimensions of democratic attitude and recognition of equality were statistically significantly higher. Conclusion:  and attachment are associated with many steps of addiction. In the fight against addiction, it is very important to treat addiction as a family problem. The education and interventions to be made can be protective in terms of psychopathology and addiction issues, which may provide early intervention for these problems. In addition, constructive interventions related to family relationships are important in increasing the social support of people who are being treated for AUD."
What do Chilean and Costa Rican psychologists believe and advise about parenting?,2017,"This  investigates the subjective theories of 12 Chilean and Costa Rican psychologists who work with , with the purpose of describing and interpreting their explanations about  rearing. Episodic interviews were used and analyzed using a Grounded Theory model. The interviewees point out that they use their own experience and beliefs when advising s. Results indicated that, according to the interviewees, the topics most frequently consulted by s were 's high impulsivity and disciplining. The interviewees believe the most common   are the authoritarian and the permissive ones, the latter being associated with s' fear and anxiety."
"Mothering with intellectual disabilities: Relationship between social support, health and well-being, parenting and  behaviour outcomes",2008,"Background There is a general agreement in the literature that no systematic correlation exists between al intellectual disability per se and  performance. Yet, a few studies in the field of s and  with intellectual disability have explored other potential determinants of  and  outcomes. In this , we examined the relationship between maternal social support, psychological well-being,  , quality of the home environment and  problem behaviours. Materials and Methods The sample included 32 mothers recruited through agencies that offer services exclusively to persons with intellectual disabilities and their families, and each mother's oldest  in the 2- to 13-year age range. In a series of semi-structured interviews, participating mothers completed a demographic and social support questionnaire, the SF-36 (health measure), the  Stress Index, the HOME Inventory and the Child Behavior Checklist.   was assessed using the Canadian National Longitudinal Study on Children and Youth  questionnaire. Results On an average, the participating mothers reported poorer physical and mental health compared with population norms. However, a few reported clinically significant levels of  stress. Overall, the target  did not have significant problem behaviours, but these were more common in older . Main findings include a significant correlation between  stress,   and perceived  problem behaviours. Conclusion Global assessment, including health status (mental and physical) and level of  stress, as well as everyday life and  skills is recommended as basis for designing individualized supports and services for mothers with intellectual disabilities."
Attachment and parental reflective functioning features in ADHD: enhancing the knowledge on parenting characteristics,2015,"Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a disorder characterized by a chronic, pervasive, and developmentally inappropriate levels of impulsivity and in attention. It is associated with adverse academic and social functions and stress to families. Studies provide evidence that family variables are correlated with this disorder and that   play an important role in its complexity. However, a thorough investigation of the impact of al affective and relational aspects on the ADHD 's areas of functioning is still needed. In designing future  on ADHD, we suggest to investigate  characteristics to a greater extent by adopting an attachment perspective with a focus on al reflective functioning as it pertains to the 's ADHD clinical condition."
The Effect of Childhood Conduct Problems on Early Onset Substance Use: An Examination of the Mediating and Moderating Roles of Parenting Styles,2019,"This  examines the role that effective  plays in the relationship between hood conduct problems and the early onset of drug use. Effective  is posited to have a direct protective effect on drug use, a moderating effect on the relationship between conduct problems and early onset, and mediate the relationship between conduct problems and early onset. Two-generational panel data are used to examine these relationships among 263 - dyads. Support is found for the direct protective effect of effective  on early onset .and for a partial mediating effect of  in the relationship between conduct problems and early onset. There was no support found for  moderating the risk that is posed by having hood conduct problems. Implications for preventing hood conduct problems from ing in early onset of drug use through enhancing efforts to help s cope with such problems are discussed."
"Perceptions of Parenting, Emotional Self-Efficacy, and Anxiety in Youth: Test of a Mediational Model",2012,"Background Though associations between   marked by control (e. g., prevention of autonomous experiences) or rejection (e. g., criticism, arbitrary blame, and withholding of warmth) and youth anxiety have been established in the literature, few studies have examined cognitive mediators purported to explain these associations. Objective The   explored relations among perceptions of maternal and paternal , emotional self-efficacy (i.e., perceived control over negative emotion), and anxiety in adolescents and tested a mediational model in which emotional self-efficacy explains the relation between negative   and youth anxiety. Methods One hundred and twenty-four non-referred adolescents aged 12-18 completed questionnaires assessing  variables in school settings. Results Emotional self-efficacy and maternal rejection predicted anxiety, maternal control was a marginally significant predictor of anxiety, and paternal rejection and control were not associated with anxiety. Maternal rejection, but not paternal rejection or control by either , predicted emotional self-efficacy, and emotional self-efficacy mediated the relation between maternal rejection and anxiety. Conclusions Results offer support for a commonly cited theoretical pathway from maternal rejection to youth anxiety by teaching that positive emotional outcomes are rare and outside of the 's control. Support was not found for a similarly theorized pathway from maternal control to youth anxiety through emotional self-efficacy. Findings point to a greater relation between youth anxiety and perceived negative  by mothers relative to fathers."
Maternal bonding styles in smokers and non-smokers: a comparative study,2016,"Background: al bonding has been implicated in smoking behavior, and the quality of maternal bonding (MB) has been associated with poor mental health and substance use. However, little is known about the association of MB and the smoking of the offspring. Methods: In our , 129 smokers and 610 non-smoker medical students completed the al bonding instrument, which measures MB along two dimensions: care and overprotection. Four categories can be created by high and low scores on care and overprotection: optimal  (OP; high care/low overprotection); affectionless control (ALC; low care/high overprotection); affectionate constraint (AC; high care/high overprotection), and neglectful  (NP; low care/low overprotection). Nicotine dependence was assessed by the Fagerstrom Nicotine Dependence Test, exhaled CO level, and daily cigarette consumption (CPD). Results: Higher CPD was significantly associated with lower overprotection (p = 0.016) and higher care (p = 0.023) scores. The odds for being a smoker were significantly higher in the neglectful maternal bonding  compared to the other rearing  (p = 0.022). Besides, smokers showed significantly higher care and lower overprotection scores with the Mann-Whitney U-test than non-smokers, although these associations did not remain significant in multiple regression models. Conclusion: Our  indicate that focusing on early life relationship between patient and mother can be important in psychotherapeutic interventions for smoking."
The Influence of Parenting and Temperament on Empathy Development in Toddlers,2019,"Empathy is a critical ability in developing relationships, and deficits in empathy have been associated with various maladaptive social outcomes. Although specific   and behaviors (including warmth and reasoning) are expected to be related to the development of  empathy, these may function differently for  with an inhibited temperament. Children with an inhibited temperament, who are at risk for developing an anxiety disorder, may  struggle with expressing empathic behaviors. These relations were tested in a longitudinal  including mothers and their toddlers. Dyads participated at time points approximately 1 year apart when toddlers were 24 and 36 months old. Moderating effects were found for al warmth and reasoning, as well as authoritative  broadly. Maternal warmth was related to higher levels of empathy for only  with low levels of inhibited temperament. Maternal reasoning was related to lower levels of empathy for  with high levels of inhibited temperament. Thus, for  with low levels of inhibited temperament, warmth predicts higher empathy, and for  with high levels of inhibited temperament, reasoning predicts lower empathy. These findings are discussed within a goodness of fit framework, suggesting that 's positive outcomes depend on the match between  behavior and temperament."
"Parenting style, young driver compliance and the imposition of additional driving restrictions within graduated driver licensing systems",2020,"Provisional (or intermediate) drivers do not always comply with graduated driver licensing restrictions and road laws. The aim of this  was to explore the effect of   on young driver compliance with licensing restrictions. Two surveys, the first a sample of s of provisionally licensed drivers (n = 101) from Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory (Australia), while the second, and separate sample, was of provisionally licensed drivers (n = 132) from Queensland. A series of regression analyses identified that s who reported higher levels of control were more likely to feel responsible for their 's driving and to have a  that complied with licensing restrictions. s who reported higher levels of support were more likely to offer their  practical assistance in order to help them to comply with licensing restrictions. Young drivers who reported that their s had higher levels of control were more likely to indicate that they complied with restrictions. Given that   appears to influence provisional driver compliance with licensing requirements, there may be an opportunity to develop interventions to enhance compliance."
"Designing a physical activity parenting course: Parental views on recruitment, content and delivery",2012,"Background: Many  do not engage in sufficient levels of physical activity (PA) and spend too much time screen-viewing (SV). High levels of SV (e.g. watching TV, playing video games and surfing the internet) and low levels of PA have been associated with adverse health outcomes.  courses may hold promise as an intervention medium to change 's PA and SV. The current  was formative work conducted to design a new  programme to increase 's PA and reduce their SV. Specifically, we focussed on interest in a course, desired content and delivery , barriers and facilitators to participation and opinions on control group provision. Methods: In-depth telephone interviews were conducted with thirty two s (29 female) of 6-8 year olds. Data were analysed thematically. An anonymous online survey was  completed by 750 s of 6-8 year old  and descriptive statistics calculated. Results: Interview participants were interested in a  course because they wanted general  advice and ideas to help their  be physically active. s indicated that they would benefit from knowing how to quantify their 's PA and SV levels. s wanted practical ideas of alternatives to SV. Most s would be unable to attend unless care was provided. Schools were perceived to be a trusted source of information about  courses and the optimal recruitment location. In terms of delivery , the majority of s stated they would prefer a group-based approach that provided opportunities for peer learning and support with professional input. Survey participants reported the timing of classes and the provision of care were essential factors that would affect participation. In terms of designing an intervention, the most preferred control group option was the opportunity to attend the same course at a later date. Conclusions: s are interested in PA/SV  courses but the provision of  care is essential for attendance. Recruitment is likely to be facilitated via trusted sources. s want practical advice on how to overcome barriers and suggest advice is provided in a mutually supportive group experience with expert input."
A cross-cultural comparison of mothers' beliefs about their parenting very young ,2012,"al beliefs are relevant to  development because they shape  behaviors and help to determine and regulate  cognitive and socioemotional growth. Here we investigated cross-cultural variation in Italian and U.S. mothers' al beliefs about their social and didactic interactions with their young . To compare al beliefs. the al Style Questionnaire (PSQ) was administered to samples of 273 Italian mothers and 279 U.S. mothers of 20-month-olds (55% male). To conduct substantive cross-cultural comparisons of beliefs, the measurement invariance of the PSQ was first established by hierarchical multi-group confirmatory factor analyses. The PSQ was essentially invariant across cultures. Italian mothers reported that they engaged in both social and didactic behaviors with their young  less frequently than U.S. mothers. Results of our  confirm that mothers in different cultures differentially value al stimulation and its relevance for early  development. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
The relationship of parenting style to self-reported mental health among two subcultures of Chinese,2001,"The  of this investigation with 127 youths (aged 16-22 years) from mainland China supported the association of recalled 's  (assessed by the EMBU) with adolescents' self-evaluated health status (measured by the SCL-90). Many psychosomatic symptoms and lower scores on indexes of general mental health were significantly related to higher levels of al rejection and denial, punishing tendency, overprotection and overinvolvement and to lower levels of al emotional warmth and comprehension. The association between   and mental health status of adolescents can he generalized across genders and across the two Chinese subcultures studied (Han and Kejia ethnical groups) with moderate to fairly high confidence. The mental health status of participants suggests some differences between different subcultures or genders on several variables of the SCL-90.

Debates on attachment parenting in the Argentine media: famous mothers and co-sleeping sect,2019,"This article analyzes discussions about attachment  that circulated in the Argentine media about   among TV celebrities during 2014 y 2015. Attachment  implies that during the early years of life infants need permanent care and attention from their mother preferably. It is examined the role of mass culture in the dissemination of ideas and prescriptions on forms of  care. Then, the explanations and opinions offered on television shows and articles about the trend of  with attachment are observed to think about on ongoing transformations of maternal subjectivities. In sum, the  identifies the selection of celebrities and follower-mothers, mostly reed as exotic and irrational, and, at the same time, a spirit of the times in which women join and contest their engagement in the public sphere."
Attachment styles in alcoholic inpatients,2007,"Despite the fact that addiction has often been identified as an attachment disorder, empirical studies on this topic are rather scarce. In our  we explore attachment  (secure vs. insecure) in alcoholic inpatients and its relationship with perceived  and alcohol-related and psychiatric problems in a sample of 101 alcoholic inpatients (Belgium). Our  reveal that in comparison to the securely-attached group, insecurely-attached alcoholic inpatients perceived their mother as more controlling, reported more severe psychiatric problems in the European Addiction Severity Index, had higher scores on the Beck Depression Inventory, showed more schizotypal and depressive personality traits and had more difficulties with communicating emotions (alexithymia). We argue that it makes sense to differentiate alcoholic inpatients on the basis of attachment  and that both groups (secure/insecure) need different treatment approaches. Copyright (c) 2007 S.

"Direct and indirect links between parenting styles, self-concealment (secrets), impaired control over drinking and alcohol-related outcomes",2015,"Introduction: Self-concealment reflects uncomfortable feelings, thoughts, and information people have about themselves that they avoid telling others (Larson & Chastain, 1990). According to Larson and Chastain (1990) these secrets range from the slightly embarrassing to the very distressing with an individual's most traumatic experiences often concealed. al attitudes including those involving self-disclosure are thought to be expressed in their choice of   (Brand, Hatzinger, Beck, & Holsboer-Trachsler, 2009). The specific aim of this investigation was to examine the direct and indirect influences of   on self-concealment, impaired control over drinking (i.e. the inability to stop drinking when intended), alcohol use (quantity/frequency), and alcohol-related problems. Methods: A structural equation model with 419 (223 men, 196 women) university students was examined. Two and three path mediated effects were examined with the bias corrected bootstrap technique in Mplus. Results: Having an authoritarian mother was directly linked to more self-concealment, while having an authoritative father was directly linked to less self-concealment. Higher levels of mother authoritarianism were indirectly linked to both increased alcohol use and alcohol-related problems through more self-concealment and more impaired control over drinking. Moreover, higher levels of father authoritativeness were indirectly linked to less alcohol use and alcohol-related problems through less self-concealment and less impaired control over drinking. Conclusions: These findings suggest that   influence vulnerabilities such as self-concealment in the impaired control over the drinking pathway to alcohol use and alcohol-related problems.

Trajectories of parenting behavior and maternal depression,2013,"This  investigated trajectories of maternal  behavior across the infants' first 18 months of life in relation to maternal depression. Furthermore, predictors of the quality of the mother-infant relationship at 18 months were examined. Participants consisted of three types of mother-infant dyads: mothers with comorbid depression and anxiety (n = 19), mothers with depression (n = 7) and nondepressed mothers (n = 24). Maternal behaviors and the quality of relationship were rated on a global scale (NICHD) from video-taped mother-infant interactions. Maternal behaviors rated at six, 12 and 18 months were collapsed into a composite variable maternal . The quality of the relationship captured as dyadic mutuality was rated at 18 months. Comorbid and depressed mothers showed lower quality in maternal  compared with the nondepressed mothers at six months. Over the follow-up the comorbid mothers were lower in maternal  compared to the nondepressed mothers, but the comorbid mothers increased significantly in maternal  despite elevated depression symptoms. Mean maternal  and infant cognitive skills predicted the quality in relationship at 18 months suggesting that the mother-toddler relationship depends on contributions from the mother and the . Higher growth in maternal  despite of depression symptoms among comorbid mothers was interpreted against the background that the majority of the comorbid mother-infant dyads received several treatments.

Intergenerational studies of parenting and the transfer of risk from parent to ,2003,"This review describes a recent approach to ing the intergenerational processes that place families and  at risk for a broad variety of social, behavioral, and health problems. Intergenerational studies typically involve two (or more) generations of participants, observed over time. These projects are utilized to  the origins and early determinants of  behavior and of other environmental, health, and social conditions that place young offspring at risk for continuing behavioral, cognitive, and health problems. Convergent findings, across a broad range of  populations in several countries, suggest that problematic  develops in part through learning the behavior modeled by one's own s. In addition, problematic  seems to be an extension of an individual's early  of aggressive and problematic social behavior. s with a history of hood aggression, in particular, tend to have continuing social, behavioral, and health difficulties, as do their offspring. Conversely, al involvement, cognitive stimulation, warmth, and nurturance appear to have important protective effects for offspring. Finally, educational achievement appears to be a powerful buffer against problematic  and a wide variety of difficult family circumstances, protecting families against the transfer of risk between generations."
A COMPARATIVE-ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PARENTING STYLES AND SELF-CONCEPTS OF BLACK-AND-WHITE HIGH-SCHOOL-STUDENTS,1995,"This  aimed to examine the relationships between   and self-concepts of Black and White high school students. Data on these variables were collected from 2014 adolescents from five urban high schools around the metropolitan area of Cape Town, South Africa.   were measured by the Perceived al Behavior Inventory (PPBI) and self-concept by the Self-Description Inventory (SDI). For Black students all the self-concept facets measured were positively related to their perceptions of al behaviors, although the relationship reached significance only for the relations with family, general school and physical appearance self-concepts for White students. Growing up in a socioeconomically segregated society is considered in the light of -adolescent relations and self-concept."
Religion and parenting: ignored relationship?,2014,"Even though the social work profession has been increasingly sensitized to the spiritual needs of those that they are working with, recent history has demonstrated that professionals lack the knowledge and skills needed for understanding those who are subscribing to strong religious beliefs. The  reported in this paper draws on a qualitative  that examined the perceived caregiving practice of s from the Seventh-day Adventist faith community associated with the conservative Protestant sub-culture. Twenty-five participants aged 20-50 were invited to recall their experiences of being reared by practicing Adventist s in the UK. An integrative phenomenological analysis yielded a number of themes that shed light on the relationship between religion and . This paper will focus on the three key ideas that emerged:  was influenced by beliefs that s held; a combination of warm and strict  was found with some evidence of stricter upbringing amongst black respondents; responses to  reported varied between acceptance and discomfort.

Caregiver's Feeding Styles Questionnaire. Establishing cutoff points,2012,"Researchers use the Caregiver's Feeding Styles Questionnaire (CFSQ) to categorize  feeding into authoritative, authoritarian, indulgent, and uninvolved . The CFSQ assesses self-reported feeding and classifies s using median splits which are used in a substantial body of  literature and allow for direct comparison across studies on dimensions of demandingness and responsiveness. No national norms currently exist for the CFSQ. This paper establishes and recommends cutoff points most relevant for low-income, minority US samples that ers and clinicians can use to assign s to feeding . Median scores for five studies are examined and the average across these studies reported. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Parental style and Cloninger's model in psychosis,2018,"al  and Cloninger's dimensions are associated with psychosis, but it is still unclear whether temperament, character and  variables are linked to specific psychotic symptoms. This  extends previous  exploring these issues. 78 patients with psychosis and 156 control subjects were recruited. al  was evaluated using the Measure of al Style. Temperament and character were evaluated using the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised. Psychotic symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. T-tests, correlations and moderation and mediation analyses were performed. Patients reported dysfunctional  and had higher scores for harm avoidance (HA) and self transcendence (ST), and lower scores for self directedness (SD) and cooperativeness (CO) than controls. Maternal indifference, abuse and overcontrol were correlated with positive symptoms (PS). Novelty seeking (NS), reward dependence, SD, CO were correlated with PS; HA and ST were correlated with negative symptoms. After adjusting for age, gender and family history of psychopathology lower CO partially mediated the relationship between maternal abuse and PS; the positive NS-maternal abuse interaction was associated with PS. Different  and personality variables may be associated with different psychotic symptoms. NS and CO may be part of a pathway between maternal abuse and PS."
Assessment of infant feeding styles among low-income African-American mothers: Comparing reported and observed behaviors,2007,"This 's goal was to provide a detailed description of feeding  adopted by a sample of African-American women in feeding their infants in North Carolina, and to examine the correspondence between reported and observed feeding . Cross-sectional semi-structured interview and videotaped data were gathered in the homes of 20 participating low-income mothers of infants aged 3-20 months. Feeding  were characterized through a tailored coding scheme (the Infant Feeding Styles Video Coding Scheme, IFSVCS) applied to both interview and video-taped data. We found that the most frequent feeding  identified for both interviews and videotaped observations was restrictive, but that mothers were roughly equally divided among predominantly controlling (pressuring or restrictive) and less controlling (laissez-faire or indulgent)  across methods. However, for over 2/3 of the sample, there was a lack of correspondence between interview and video-taped feeding .

Overt and relational aggression in Russian nursery-school-age : Parenting style and marital linkages,1998,"Maternal and paternal   and marital interactions linked to hood aggressive behavior as described in Western psychological literature were measured in an ethnic Russian sample of 207 families of nursery-school-age . Results corroborated and extended findings from Western samples. Maternal and paternal coercion, lack of responsiveness, and psychological control (for mothers only) were significantly correlated with 's overt aggression with peers. Less responsiveness (for mothers and fathers) and maternal coercion positively correlated with relational aggression. Some of these associations differed for boys versus girls. Marital conflict was  linked to more overt and relational aggression for boys. When entered into the same statistical model, more marital conflict (for boys only), more maternal coercion, and less paternal responsiveness were found to be the most important contributors to overt and relational aggression in younger Russian ."
Psychological and physical intimate partner violence and young 's mental health: The role of maternal posttraumatic stress symptoms and parenting behaviors,2018,"Young  are at significant risk of exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV), and vulnerable to exposure-related psychopathology, yet few studies investigate the effects of exposure to IPV on  under the age of 5 years. The current  investigated the role of maternal PTSD symptoms and  strategies in the relationship between mothers' IPV experiences and psychopathology in their young , ages 3-6 years in a community-based cohort of 308 mother- dyads at high risk for family violence. Data were collected from 2011 to 2014. IPV history and maternal PTSD symptoms were assessed by self-report questionnaires. Children's symptoms were assessed with a developmentally-sensitive psychiatric interview administered to mothers. Punitive/restrictive  was independently-coded from in-depth interviews with mothers about their disciplinary practices. Hypothesized direct and indirect pathways between physical and psychological IPV, maternal PTSD, maternal  , and 's internalizing and externalizing symptoms were examined with mediation models. Results indicated that neither physical nor psychological IPV experienced by mothers was directly associated with 's symptoms. However, both types of victimization were associated with maternal PTSD symptoms. Examination of indirect pathways suggested that maternal PTSD symptoms mediated the relationship between mothers' psychological and physical IPV experiences and 's internalizing and externalizing symptoms and mothers' restrictive/punitive  mediated the relationship between mothers' psychological IPV and 's externalizing symptoms. In addition, there was a path from maternal physical IPV to  externalizing symptoms through both maternal PTSD symptoms and restrictive/punitive . Findings highlight the importance of supporting s in recovering from the sequelae of their own traumatic experiences, as their ensuing mental health symptoms and  behaviors may have a significant impact on their 's emotional health."
Can Parenting Programme Reduce Parent-Adolescents Conflicts in Hong Kong?,2013,This article reported the outcome of an adapted British  programme in Hong Kong which aimed at reducing -adolescents conflicts. Adolescents' outcome was measured by Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and 's  stress was measured by  stress Index short form (PSI-SF). The level of conflict between s and their adolescents was measured by -adolescent conflict scale (PAC). The  showed that s of the experimental groups showed significant decrease in  stress after the programme. SDQ showed significant decrease in adolescents' difficulties and significant decrease in conflict between s and their adolescents. Significant between group differences was observed between experimental groups and comparison group in   dysfunction interaction and granting of autonomy to their . Participant satisfaction survey indicated majority of s perceived the programme as helpful to their  as well as reducing conflict with their adolescents. The presence  showed a promising design of a  programme that support s of adolescents in facing their conflicts with their adolescents.
Impact of stress and parenting on respiratory sinus arrythmia trajectories in early adolescence,2021,"The effects of stress and  on 1-year trajectories of physiological emotion regulation capacity among adolescents were examined. Consistent with the vulnerability-stress and allostatic load models, stress (chronic family and marital) was hypothesized to be associated with less favorable trajectories of basal respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) over 1 year. This relationship was further hypothesized to be moderated by  practices (warmth, neglect, and rejection) and adolescent sex. Participants included 150 adolescents (51.3% female), 11-15 years of age (M = 13.04, SD = 0.89). Basal RSA and stress were assessed four times across 1 year. Results indicated a significant decrease in RSA over the course of 1 year (beta = -0.15, p = .010). Warm   was associated with lower RSA in environments of low marital stress and was  related with higher RSA in environments of high marital stress (beta = 0.86, p = .021). Rejecting   were associated with higher RSA in environments of low family stress and lower RSA in environments of high family stress (beta = -0.60, p = .014). These findings may be explained by the Yerkes-Dodson law of optimal stress, suggesting that sufficient environmental challenge is needed to catalyze regulatory development."
Democratic parenting: paradoxical messages in democratic parent education theories,2013,"Some prominent  education theories in the United States and other Western countries base their educational viewpoint explicitly on democratic values, such as mutual respect, equality and personal freedom. These democratic  theories advocate sharing power with  and including them in family decision making. This  s a textual analysis of two such theories, the Adlerian model of  education and the  Effectiveness Training (PET) model, as they are embodied in two original bestselling textbooks. Through content and argumentation analysis of these influential texts, this  examines the paradoxes inherent in these two theories when they articulate how to implement fully democratic principles within the - relationship. We discover that in spite of their democratic rationale, both books offer communication practices that guide the  to modify misbehaviour, enforce al power, and manipulate the  to make decisions that follow al judgment, and thus do not endorse the use of a truly democratic  . We suggest, as an alternative to the democratic  , that s be introduced to a guardianship management , in which they do not share authority with , but seek opportunities for enabling  to make more autonomous decisions and participate in more family decision making."
Psychometric properties of Parenting and Family Adjustment Scale (PAFAS) in a Turkish sample with parents of 2-12 years old  from both community and clinical sample,2020,"Objective: The   aimed to examine the psychometric properties of  and Family Adjustment Scale (PAFAS) to measure  skills and family adjustment in Turkish s. Method: The sample of our  consisted of the s of  between the ages of 2-12. The clinical sample is from 201 mothers or fathers who were in the first 1-month evaluation process at the Dokuz Eylul University Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic; the population sample consisted of 202 mothers or fathers living in Balcova. For test-retest measurement, the test was re administered to 58 s in the community sample two weeks later. Psychometric properties of the scale were compared to  Styles and Dimensions Scale, Marriage Life Scale and General Health Questionnaire. Results: Internal consistency of  subscale were found quite reliable and Family Adjustment subscale were found highly reliable. There was no significant difference in the test-retest application of the PAFAS Turkish Form subscale and factor structures. PAFAS Turkish Form has high power to differentiate community and clinical samples; has a five-factor structure validity. It was determined that it has concurrent criterion validity with  Styles and Dimensions Scale, Marriage Life Scale and General Health Questionnaire. Discussion: In this , it has been found that the Turkish version of PAFAS is a good valid and reliable scale for screening multiple domains of family functioning."
Relationship between Parenting and Cognitive Schemas in a Group of Male Adult Offenders,2016,"This work analyzes the correlation of retrospective ratings on al binding with cognitive patterns in the inmates for property crimes.

Does positive parenting predict pro-social behavior and friendship quality among adolescents? Emotional intelligence as a mediator,," has been reported to exert significant short-term and long-term impact on the offspring's personality, behavior, and relationships during their lifespan. The   aimed to assess the impact of positive  on the trait emotional intelligence, prosocial behavior (altruism) and friendship quality of adolescents. The sample of   comprised 350 adolescents (208 boys and 142 girls) aged between 14 and 16 year (M = 15. 46 year,SD = .86) and their s. The data were collected from two public and two private sector schools of Lahore, Pakistan.  Style Scale (Batool and MumtazPakistan Journal of Psychological Reseaech, 30(2), 225-248,2015), the Emotional Intelligence Scale for Children and Adolescents (Batool and HayatPakistan Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 16(2), 17-26,2018), the Altruistic Personality Scale (Rushton et al.Personality and Individual Differences, 1, 292-302,1981), and the Intimate Friendship Scale (Sharabany1974) were employed. The final model of a mediational path analysis revealed that positive  had a statistically significant indirect impact on the prosocial behavior of adolescents via emotional intelligence (R-2 = .24). As the friendship quality of adolescents concerns, positive  had statistically significant direct and indirect impact (via emotional intelligence and prosocial behavior) on it (R-2 = .28). Gender appeared as a significant covariate of both prosocial behavior and friendship quality. Based on the , we suggest s to practice positive   and recommend emotional intelligence training of adolescents to promote prosocial behavior and better relationship with friends."
"Relationships between traumatic events, 's gender, and political activity, and perceptions of parenting styles",1997,"The associations between traumatic events, 's gender and political activity, and   were examined among 108 Palestinians of 11-12 years of age. The  showed that the more the  were exposed to traumatic events, the more they perceived both their s as strictly disciplining, rejecting, and hostile, and their mothers as more negatively evaluating. The boys perceived both their s as treating them more negatively than the girls did. Affectionate , such as intimacy and love, for its part, was not associated with traumatic events, and did not vary according to the 's gender or political activity. The gender of the  affected the association between traumatic events, political activity, and perceived . Traumatic events increased perceived al rejection and hostility only among the boys, and perceived strict disciplining only among the girls. Although politically active  perceived both of their s as more negative in general, in the families exposed to a high level of traumatic events, passive boys perceived their fathers as more rejecting and hostile than active boys did. It is suggested that mothers and fathers rear girls restrictively and with greater attention, and boys with rejection, when the family faces traumatic events. In exposed families, fathers  tend to discourage boys' political passivity and aply encourage activity."
Interactive Effects of Perceived Parental Rearing Styles on Distress Tolerance and Psychological Distress in Pakistani University Students,2021,"Several empirical studies have linked   with different mental health consequences in samples from Western nations, with some studies  in East Asian countries. However, few studies have analyzed such associations specifically in South Asian countries such as Pakistan. Moreover, few studies have examined the potential interactive role of al rearing practices by both s in relation to distress tolerance and psychological distress. In the current , we evaluated the interaction of mothers' and fathers'   in relation to distress tolerance and psychological distress in Pakistani university students. Three hundred university students were recruited using a stratified sampling strategy. Students completed measures of their mothers' and fathers'   (separately), their distress tolerance, and their general psychological distress. There was great similarity in respondents' recollection of   by mothers and fathers. Results of regression analyses indicated that high al rejection and overprotection were associated with poorer distress tolerance and greater psychological distress. Although the direct associations of emotional warmth with distress tolerance and psychological distress were small, emotional warmth interacted with other  , such that negative effects of al rejection and overprotection were lessened in the context of higher emotional warmth."

Predictors of attachment security in preschool  from intact and divorced families,2005,"The authors selected 58 mother- dyads from divorced and intact families to participate in a  on the impact of divorce on preschoolers' attachment security. The authors explored pathways that lead to security of attachment. They found that mothers from divorced families were younger, had lower income levels, and had lower levels of education compared with their intact counterparts. Divorced mothers  reported significantly higher levels of stress, depression, need for social support, and conflict with their spouses. Mothers from intact families were more likely to use positive (authoritative)   compared with divorced mothers. Children in the divorced group had lower security scores on the Attachment Q-Set instrument (E. Waters, 1995). Regression analyses indicated that   made a direct (independent) contribution to attachment security. In addition, temperament was related to attachment security, but temperament did not diminish the association of   with attachment security. Furthermore, regression analyses indicated that the relationship of divorce to attachment security was mediated by  ."
The Relationship Between Different Parenting Typologies in Fathers and Mothers and Children's Anxiety,2016,"Research on the role of al rearing behaviors in the development of 's anxiety problems has predominantly adopted a dimensional approach ing the effects of isolated  behaviors such as overprotection and rejection, while mainly focusing on the mother. Our  was set up to identify  typologies of both mothers and fathers, and to explore their relationship with 's anxiety symptoms. Three-hundred-and-ninety non-clinical Portuguese  aged 8-12 years completed a self-report questionnaire on anxiety disorder symptoms, while their fathers (27-64 years of age) and mothers (24-65 years of age) filled in two scales on al rearing behaviors as well as an index of al anxiety. Cluster analysis revealed three  typologies that were similar for mothers and fathers, and were labeled as overinvolved, disengaged, and supportive . Only the disengaged typology of mothers was associated with higher levels of anxiety symptoms on . Disengaged s and Overinvolved fathers were associated with higher levels of al anxiety whereas overinvolved s evidenced more anxiety/worry about the . These  suggest that the  of  typologies, contextualized within a cultural background, are an invaluable approach because it can be used to explore the effects that different combinations of various  behaviors may have on hood anxiety."
Parenting advice for intercultural couples: a systemic perspective,2017,"This article s advice for intercultural s, based on findings of a qualitative  that examined how intercultural s negotiated their cultural differences. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with fourteen intercultural heterosexual couples/s in South East Queensland. Thematic analysis was used to analyse data and understand the meanings of participants' experiences. The findings revealed that not only aspects of cultural background, but  systemic and contextual factors impacted on the experiences of intercultural s. Advice for intercultural s is described from three systemic perspectives: the individual sphere, the couple/ sphere and the 's sphere. Practical implications for therapists and counsellors working with intercultural s are discussed.

Development and validation of a questionnaire in parenting patterns : evidence from Tamil culture in Northern Sri Lanka,2016,"Adolescent health issues such as substance abuse, high risk sexual behaviours and psychosocial problems are becoming a threat globally. The World Health Organization has identified  interventions as a strategy to improve adolescent health. This  aimed to develop and validate a tool to understand  practices for Northern Province Tamil culture in Sri Lanka. A  Patterns Questionnaire (PPQ) with three subscales for three  dimensions; 'Connection', 'Control' and 'Respect', was constructed in accordance with   and  tools used in Western countries and by expert opinion. Item analysis was conducted to establish the internal consistency and exploratory factor analysis was conducted to check whether the items are assigned to the correct subscales. Construct validity of the PPQ was confirmed by demonstration of a moderate to good correlation with two hypothetical constructs, namely the wellbeing of the  demonstrated by the scores of Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and educational performance of the  assessed by the marks of previous term examination. The internal consistency of the PPQ and subscales was satisfactory (Cronbach's alpha > 0.7). The test re-test reliability  was satisfactory for PPQ (Pearson's correlation Coefficient > 0.9 for selected items). The correlations between the  quality assessed by the PPQ and the above mentioned constructs showed a moderate correlation (r > 0.3). This tool (PPQ) has the potential to be used by ers to assess  in selected dimensions ('Connection', 'Control' and 'Respect') in Sri Lankan Tamil culture."
"Brief report: Poverty, stress, and support: Patterns of parenting behaviour among lower income black and lower income white mothers",2003,"The relation between  behaviour and poverty has been established, with impoverished s' related experiences of stress and support typically implicated in the development of negative  behaviour. Additionally, differences in  behaviour have been identified for families with different ethnic backgrounds. However, whether ethnicity continues to effect similar differences in families'  behaviour in the face of the challenges associated with poverty or whether poverty leads to greater similarities or differences in  behaviour across ethnicity is not clear. Understanding how  behaviour is affected by the challenges of poverty is essential for identifying appropriate supportive programmes to enhance the development of  in these families. To better understand the  behaviours of lower income African American and European American mothers, this  identified levels of stress, family- and community-based support, and qualitative and quantitative measures of  for 30 African American and 30 European American mothers with  between 3 and 5 years of age. Both groups of mothers reported high levels of stress and low levels of support in their role as s. Few differences in either mothers' ratings of how they ed or their descriptions of their  behaviours were identified suggesting similar   between these two groups of low-income s. All mothers used less authoritarian  than expected based on poverty levels. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd."
"I think, therefore I am: a twin study of attributional style in adolescents",2006,"Background:  factors may be important to the development of attributional  in adolescence, which in turn relates to depression symptoms. These relationships have mainly been considered in terms of social risk mechanisms, and little is known about the role of genetic influences. Method: Self-reported measures of attributional , depression symptoms and al disciplinary  were administered to over 1300 adolescent twin and sibling pairs. Model-fitting techniques were used to examine the role of genetic and environmental influences. Results: Moderate genetic influences on attributional  were demonstrated, and furthermore, its association with depression reflected considerable genetic effects. Familial factors were implicated in the association between attributional  and punitive , although genetic from shared environmental causes could not be distinguished. Conclusions: Our  demonstrate that attributional  is influenced by genetic, as well as social factors. Implications for aetiological pathways integrating cognitive, genetic and social factors on adolescent depression are discussed."
"Parenting, Self-Control, and the Gender Gap in Heavy Drinking: The Case of Russia",2013,"Drawing on Gottfredson and Hirschi's theory linking  to deviant behavior via development of self-control, the authors assess the association between  , self-control ability, and frequent alcohol use separately for males and females. The authors' findings from a random sample of 440 Russian respondents provide mixed support for self-control theory. Contrary to the theory, but in line with extant , the authors failed to uncover significant gender differences in hood upbringing or establish a strong link between  techniques and self-control. Furthermore, whereas al upbringing appears to increase the likelihood of frequent drinking among men, self-control does not mediate this relationship but rather acts as an independent predictor of men's alcohol abuse. Finally, the relatively modest contribution of self-control differences to the gender gap in frequent drinking suggests that higher alcohol consumption among men likely stems from alternative, possibly context-embedded factors."
"Chinese preschoolers' false belief understanding: Is social knowledge underpinned by parental styles, social interactions or executive functions?",2006,"The ontogenesis of social understanding has been linked with a range of cognitive skills involving executive functions and social factors like the 's social interactions. This  was conducted in China in order to test recent claims that members of the 's social network and   are instrumental in facilitating this development and that oriental  show advanced skills in executive functions and relatively slow 'theory of mind' development. Sixty-seven preschoolers performed executive and false tests and 64 of their s returned questionnaires about the 's social network and their disciplinary strategies. Individual social and cognitive factors predicted false belief but in regression analyses inhibitory control remained significant and one social predictor, interaction with cousins, was negatively related to social awareness. The data suggest the importance of analyses of the origins of social knowledge in diverse cultural settings and exploring the cognitive and social factors that underlie this development."

Personality Disorder and Perceived Parenting in Chinese Students of Divorced and Intact Families,2016,"Background: Nurturing environment contributes to the personality development of young people, but how inappropriate al bonding from biological s influences the personality disorder functioning  of their offspring in divorced families remains unclear. Objective: We aimed to find out the relationship between   and students' disordered personality in divorced families. Methods: The al Bonding Instrument (PBI) and the Parker Personality Measure (PERM) were administered to 60 Chinese students from divorced family (Divorced group) and 120 controls (matched in age and gender) from intact family (Intact group). The depressive tendency of the participants was measured with the Plutchik-van Praag Depression Inventory (PVP). Results: PERM borderline  was more prominent when father was perceived as secondary carer than primary carer in Divorced group. When father was perceived as secondary carer, PERM borderline  was more obvious in Divorced group than in Intact group. Maternal autonomy denial and care predicted PERM narcissistic and dependent  in Divorced group, when mother was perceived as primary carer. In the Intact group, when mother was perceived as secondary carer, maternal care was lower than when mother was perceived as primary carer. Some al PBI scales predicted certain PERM scales regardless of the carer order. Conclusions: The  imply that in divorced family, biological father should be more involved in young people's daily life, and biological mother should show more care and less autonomy denial. In intact family, more care, less freedom control, and less autonomy denial from both s are important in the personality development of their offspring."
Trajectories of clinical and parenting outcomes following admission to an inpatient mother-baby unit,2019,"Background: This  aimed to examine trajectories of clinical and  outcomes following admission to a mother-baby unit (MBU), and to explore factors associated with these trajectories. Methods: Women admitted to an MBU completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Karitane  Confidence Scale (KPCS) and Maternal Postnatal Attachment Scale (MPAS) at admission, discharge and 3?months following discharge. Questions assessing psychosocial risk and adult attachment  were  completed at admission, and information relating to service engagement in the time since discharge was collected at follow-up. Additional clinical and demographic information was extracted from the patient medical record. Results: Seventy-five women participated in the . Overall, significant improvements in mean scores on measures of anxiety and  confidence were maintained 3-months following discharge. However, the majority of women (93.3%) followed trajectories that were characterised by deterioration in self-reported mother-infant attachment following discharge. 62.9 and 34.6% of women followed trajectories of increased symptoms of depression and stress between discharge and follow-up, respectively. Across measures, the least optimal trajectories, or least optimal scores, at follow-up were associated with less secure maternal attachment  (associated with more anxiety symptoms, poorer  confidence and maternal-infant attachment), older maternal age (more depressive symptoms) and increased psychosocial risk (more anxiety symptoms). Conclusions: The findings of this  highlight the clinical implications of anxious attachment  for the mental health and  outcomes of women admitted to an MBU and the importance of incorporating mother-infant therapy as part of an ongoing management plan. Comprehensive discharge planning and transitional care to help ensure women discharged from an MBU are best supported in the longer term is recommended."
Perceptions of Parenting Behavior by Adolescents: The Development of the Malaysian Parenting Behavior Inventory,2021,"We conducted a  with the aims of examining adolescents' perceptions of their mother's and father's  behavior and developing a new Malaysian  Behavior Inventory (MPBI). In Phase One, we recruited 903 adolescents using the proportionate to size sampling technique. The  of the exploratory factor analyses of the MPBI Mother and Father scales revealed four underlying factor structures: Warmth, Monitoring, and Harsh Discipline were somewhat similar to those in past findings and theory, and Indigenous centered on religious and cultural values in . In Phase Two, using an independent sample of adolescents, we replicated the factor structure of Study One with confirmatory factor analysis, ing in strong model fit estimates. We conclude that the MPBI has good initial psychometric properties and is culturally influenced. The MPBI may be useful for prevention and intervention programs in clinical and non-clinical settings, including providing valuable information on factors pertinent to -adolescent interactions."
The contribution of perceived parental and familial characteristics to attitudes toward accompanied driving among young drivers,2011,"One of the main requirements of the graduated driving licensing system in Israel is that new drivers be accompanied by an experienced driver (usually one of their s) for the first three months after receipt of their license. The current series of studies examined the associations between young drivers' attitudes toward accompanied driving (ATAD) and their perception of their s' driving  and  modes, as well as dynamic of their family. Young drivers completed questionnaires assessing their ATAD, and either perceived al driving  (Study 1, n = 100), perceived   (Study 2, n =120), or perceived family dynamic (Study 3, n = 254). The  indicated significant associations between the young drivers' ATAD of tension, relatedness, avoidance, disapproval, and anxiety, and their own perceptions of the characteristic driving  of their s (risky, anxious, angry, and careful). They  indicated significant relationship between youngsters' ATAD and their perceptions of their s'  modes (responsive, demanding, and autonomy-granting). Finally, the  indicated significant negative associations between ATAD of tension, avoidance, disapproval, and anxiety, and family cohesion and adaptability, and a positive association between these two and relatedness. The  are discussed in respect to the relationship between the al model and the young drivers' ATAD in particular, and risk management in general, and practical implications of these  are offered.

Parenting behavior and the risk of becoming a victim and a bully/victim: A meta-analysis study,2013,"Objective: Being bullied has adverse effects on 's health. Children's family experiences and  behavior before entering school help shape their capacity to adapt and cope at school and have an impact on 's peer relationship, hence it is important to identify how   and - relationship are related to victimization in order to develop intervention programs to prevent or mitigate victimization in hood and adolescence. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the published literature on  behavior and peer victimization using MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Eric and EMBASE from 1970 through the end of December 2012. We included prospective cohort studies and cross-sectional studies that investigated the association between  behavior and peer victimization. Results: Both victims and those who both bully and are victims (bully/victims) were more likely to be exposed to negative  behavior including abuse and neglect and maladaptive . The effects were generally small to moderate for victims (Hedge's g range: 0.10-0.31) but moderate for bully/victims (0.13-0.68). Positive  behavior including good communication of s with the , warm and affectionate relationship, al involvement and support, and al supervision were protective against peer victimization. The protective effects were generally small to moderate for both victims (Hedge's g: range: -0.12 to -0.22) and bully/victims (-0.17 to -0.42). Conclusions: Negative  behavior is related to a moderate increase of risk for becoming a bully/victim and small to moderate effects on victim status at school. Intervention programs against bullying should extend their focus beyond schools to include families and start before  enter school. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Beyond parenting practices: Family context and the treatment of pediatric obesity,2008,"Many family-based treatments for pediatric obesity teach specific  practices related to weight management. Although youth in these programs show increases in positive health behaviors and reductions in the extent to which they are overweight, most remain overweight after treatment. A recent trend is to create tailored programs for subgroups of families. We examine the possibility of tailoring based on family context, highlighting 3 aspects of family context that have been studied in relation to pediatric obesity:  , family stress, and family emotional climate. We argue that family context may moderate treatment outcomes by altering the effectiveness of health-related  practices and discuss the implications of this argument for designing and evaluating tailored programs."
Helping Families Improve: An Evaluation of Two Primary Care Approaches to Parenting Support in the Netherlands,2009,"The   evaluated two primary care  interventions. First, we evaluated the most widely used Dutch practices for primary care  support. Second, we assessed the applicability of the Primary Care Triple P approach, which is now being utilized in a wide variety of primary care settings. Both interventions target s of  with mild to moderate behavioural and/or emotional problems, with the aim of improving  skills and thereby decreasing  problems. We examined the interventions in pre-, post- and follow-up assessment, and compared the . Both interventions produced significant reductions in reported  emotional and behaviour problems, that  remained after 3 months. For both groups,   were  found to have improved at both post-test and follow-up measurement. When compared with the regular Dutch  consultation practices, however, the Primary Care Triple P approach produced greater reductions in al laxness and total  dysfunction, and greater improvement in total  competence at both post-test and follow-up. Primary Care Triple P may even-in light of the greater improvements in  skills and total al competences in the Triple P group than in the regular Dutch  consultation group-produce better  in the long run concerning  behaviour and emotional problems.

"Suicidal ideation, parenting style, and family climate among Hong Kong adolescents",2001,"The prevalence of suicidal ideation and its relations with perceived  treatment and family climate was examined in 120 Hong Kong students aged 15-19 years. Fifty-two per cent of the participants reported suicide ideation. Suicide ideation was found to be significantly associated with perceived authoritarian , low al warmth, high maternal over-control, negative -rearing practices, and a negative family climate. A positive family climate may act as a buffer against developing suicide ideation in adolescents."
Intergenerational transmission of parental authority in second generation of Holocaust survivors in Israel - a pilot study,2017,"A pilot  designed to examine the continuity and differences in   over two generations of s from families of Holocaust survivors. The sample included 42 s of second generation Holocaust survivors (age: 56.22 +/- 7.08) and 44 s as a control group (age: 53.56 +/- 10.6). Using two versions of the PAQ questionnaire, s reported on their own   and their recollections of their s'   during their hood. The findings revealed that the three   in the first generation of Holocaust survivors explain about 34% of the variance of permissive  in the second generation, (with permissive and authoritarian  in the first generation as dominant predictors). In the control, normal intergenerational continuity was found between the permissive and authoritarian  . It was  found that the s of second generation Holocaust survivors perceive themselves as less authoritarian, but more authoritative and permissive than their s. The findings suggest that Holocaust survivors' families hold unique characteristics of al continuity over generations."
Maternal Sleep Quality is Associated with Personal and Parenting Weight-Related Behaviors,2020,"Mothers of young  tend to report poor-quality sleep, yet little is known about links between maternal sleep quality and weight-related behaviors and  practices. Thus, mothers of preschoolers completed an online cross-sectional survey assessing their sleep, physical activity, dietary behaviors, eating ,  feeding practices, family meal behaviors, and health parameters. Comparisons by sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index item (i.e., very bad/bad,n= 87; fair,n= 255; and good/very good,n= 193) revealed mothers with poor-quality sleep had weight-related behaviors associated with higher Body Mass Index (BMI) (lower physical activity, fewer fruits/vegetables, more emotional and disinhibited eating). Poor-quality sleepers  engaged in  practices contrary to recommendations, such as less frequent modeling of healthy eating and physical activity, more control of  feeding, and fewer family meals. Mothers reporting poor-quality sleep tended to have lower  self-efficacy, poorer overall health status, more days of poor mental and physical health, greater depression, more stress, and higher BMIs. Future nutrition  should establish the directionality between sleep quality and health behaviors. Future interventions should help mothers develop strategies for improving sleep quality, such as increased physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake, and helping mothers realize how their sleep quality may affect  practices."

The  indicate key impact areas, including their relationships with their carers, perceptions of significant relationships and increased vulnerability to relationship abuse.

The article concludes with reflections on the pilot 's implications and limitations."
"Empathy and authenticity online: The roles of moral identity, moral disengagement, and parenting style",2022,"Objectives Research suggests that the Internet could be considered an arena for both virtuous and vicious behaviors, with observations of enhanced perspective-taking and honest self-reflections occurring alongside evidence of cyberbullying and deceptive communications. In the current , we explore the role of three widely recognized sources of moral behavior-moral identity, moral disengagement, and authoritative -in predicting adolescents' online empathy and online authenticity. Method In total, 788 UK adolescents aged 11-18 years (66% male) completed measures of these key constructs. Results Structural equation modeling  suggest that al responsiveness and autonomy granting are positively related to adolescents' moral identity. In turn, moral identity was positively related to both online empathy and online authenticity. Having a stronger moral identity  meant that adolescents were less likely to morally disengage, and moral disengagement was negatively related to online authenticity in adolescent females. Partial invariance across gender and age was observed. Conclusions The findings indicate that moral identity encourages moral thoughts, feelings, and actions in the online environment, including being authentic and empathic. As the formation and accessibility of one's moral identity can be promoted, we discuss the implications of these findings for cultivating prosocial behavior in the online environment as well as future  avenues."
"A new look at the links between perceived parenting, socially-prescribed perfectionism, and disordered eating",2016,"Perfectionism mediates the relation between al psychological control and disordered eating, but it is unclear whether it functions similarly within associations between other  characteristics and eating pathology. The current  tested socially-prescribed perfectionism (SPP) as a mediator of the relations between two facets of perceived   autonomy support and psychological control with disordered eating. Undergraduates (N = 333, 100% female) completed self-report measurement of  variables. Results indicated that psychological control and autonomy support were moderately correlated. Additionally, the indirect effect of  variables on disordered eating through SPP was significant across reports for both mother and father. When the directionality of variables was reversed, no indirect effects were significant, supporting the hypothesized relations between  variables. Findings reinforce prior work highlighting perfectionism as an important mechanism in the etiology of disordered eating. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
COGNITIVE READINESS AND ADOLESCENT PARENTING,1993,"This  compared cognitive readiness for  in 171 Pregnant adolescents, 48 nonpregnant adolescents, and 38 pregnant adults. The relations between cognitive readiness and  stress and behavior were  assessed. Results indicated that adolescents were less cognitively prepared, experienced more stress in the  role, and were less adaptive in their   than adult mothers. Finally, relations between cognitive readiness and  stress and maternal interactional  were found. Additional analyses controlling for multiple demographic factors suggested that demographic variables played a role in explaining age-related differences in cognitive readiness as well as the relations between readiness to  and  behavior. Cognitive readiness, however, had unique and differential explanatory power in predicting  stress."
Parents' and teachers' perceptions of adolescent storm and stress: Relations with parenting and teaching styles,2006,"The purpose of this  was to determine if s and teachers differed in their views of adolescent storm and stress, and to examine the relations of these reported perceptions with  and teaching behaviors. Subjects were s and teachers of middle and high school students in three school districts in the Midwest. Storm and stress beliefs were identified as s' and teachers' perceptions of conflict, moodiness, and risk-taking behavior. Scales assessing classic/conforming and positive adolescent behaviors  were included. Self-report assessments of  and teaching were administered as well. Results indicated that whereas both s and teachers held storm and stress beliefs, teachers maintained stronger perceptions than s. Teachers  endorsed higher classic/conforming and lower positive behaviors than did s. The  further indicated that s' perceptions of storm and stress were related to their degree of al responsiveness; but teachers' perceptions were not related to their teaching . These  suggest that stereotypic beliefs of the adolescent period continue to be maintained, and that these may influence how adults interact with adolescents."
Parent-centered parenting values among Latino immigrant mothers,2009,"This  examined -centered  values ( qualities considered important to be a 'successful' ) of Latino immigrant mothers in the United States (US) as well as their perception of  values in the dominant US culture. Latino mothers (N = 98) living in the US with at least one  between the ages of 1 and 12 years completed a survey on  values. Relational qualities, role modeling values, and firm control were highly valued, whereas low al control and having economic resources were rated relatively low. Participants  indicated that mothers in the dominant culture valued low al control and having economic resources more than they themselves valued these qualities. -centered values endorsed by Latino mothers in the  were very similar across countries of origin and levels of education. Overall  were consistent with the hypothesis that Latino mothers endorse -centered  values that adhere to a relational perspective, which emphasizes affection and loyalty towards other family members."
Parent behavior and  weight status among a diverse group of underserved rural families,2010,"The purpose of this  was threefold: to investigate the association between three  behaviors ( , feeding , and feeding practices), to evaluate whether these behaviors were associated with  weight, and to determine whether  ( and feeding) moderated the relationship between feeding practice and  weight. Ninety-nine - dyads were recruited for a cross-sectional  where s self-reported their  , feeding , and feeding practices along with demographic characteristics. Height and weight were measured for each dyad. The relationship between   and feeding  showed modest agreement. Feeding , but not  , was associated with  BMI z-score while controlling for known covariates. An indulgent feeding  was associated with a higher  weight status. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that feeding  moderated the association between restrictive feeding practices and  BMI z-score. No moderating relationship was found between feeding  and the practices of pressure to eat or monitoring and  weight. This  suggests that an indulgent feeding  may be predictive of higher  weight and that future studies should examine the possible moderating role of feeding  in the  feeding practice- weight relationship.

"The Association Between Overinvolved Parenting and Young Adults' Self-Efficacy, Psychological Entitlement, and Family Communication",2014,"This  sought to examine the association between al behavior indicative of overinvolvement and control and young adult  self-identity, namely self-efficacy and psychological entitlement. Participants in this  were 339 -young adult  dyads who completed survey measures of family environment, , family communication, and family satisfaction. Young adults  completed measures of self-efficacy and entitlement. Results showed that balanced family adaptability and cohesion, open family communication, and authoritative rather than authoritarian , were positively associated with s' and young adults' family satisfaction. al behavior that emphasized control over the  was associated with diminished self-efficacy and exaggerated psychological entitlement in young adult .

Parenting of Divorced Fathers and the Association with Children's Self-Esteem,2012,"Research suggests that high al support and control improves 's well-being. However, a large part of these studies have focused on the  of married s. Research on  after a divorce, mainly has focused on  of divorced mothers, with few exceptions concentrating primarily on non-residential fathers. Therefore, we compared both  dimensions support and control of fathers in different family structures (non-residential fathers, fathers in joint custody and married fathers). We  investigated the association between fathers'  dimensions and 's self-esteem, controlled for the  dimensions of the mother. Data from 587  (50 % girls) between 10 and 18 years old and their s were examined. Results revealed that non-residential fathers (n = 225) were less supportive and controlling than fathers in joint custody (n = 138) and married fathers (n = 224). Nevertheless, having a supportive father was beneficial to 's self-esteem in each family structure. We conclude that, even after a divorce, fathers have the capacity to enhance 's self-esteem and we suggest that future  should investigate this capacity."
Filipino Parenting in the USA: The Experiences of Filipino Mothers in Northern Nevada,2017,"Migration entails complex transformations in family functioning and dynamics, especially when traditional  beliefs and practices are not consistent with mainstream norms in the host country. Whereas some culturally embedded  beliefs might persist even after migration, others may acculturate or shift to align with -rearing norms in the host community. Using a qualitative  design with elements of indigenous Filipino psychology (Sikolohiyang Pilipino), this  explored  experiences and beliefs of Filipino immigrant s in the USA, with a specific lens towards examining continuity and change in traditional  practices. Results suggest that participants strongly maintain many aspects of traditional Filipino , including teaching Filipino culture and values, employing Filipino  practices, observing Filipino traditions, establishing the 's identity and maintaining a Filipino household. Findings were situated in the context of the  site, the complexities of the acculturation process and the potential challenges of negotiating cultural differences in  beliefs and practices."
"Parenting style and family type, but not  temperament, are associated with television viewing time in  at two years of age",2017,"Objectives Despite the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommending that electronic media be avoided in  under two years of age, screen use is common in infants and toddlers. The aims of this  were to determine how  , infant temperament, and family type are associated with television viewing in two-year-old . Study design Participants were from the Prevention of Overweight in Infancy (POI) randomized controlled trial (n = 802) (Dunedin, New Zealand). Demographic information was collected at baseline (late pregnancy), and television and other screen time assessed by questionnaire at 24 months of age.   ( Practices Questionnaire), infant temperament (Colorado Childhood Temperament Inventory), and family type (7 categories) were reported by both s. Results Data were available for 487 participants (61% of the original participants). Median television viewing was relatively low at 21 minutes per day, or 30 minutes in those watching television (82%). Children who watched television played with mobile phones (12% of ) or iPads/tablets (22% of ) more frequently than  who did not (6% of ).

Attitudes and parenting dimensions in parents' regulation of Internet use by primary and secondary school ,2013,"In keeping with the growing expansion of Internet use by  at home, this  examines the impact of al attitudes and  dimensions on the al regulation of this use. al attitudes include ideas about who decides what the  is to see on the Internet and motivations for Internet use.  dimensions involve control and warmth. al regulation involves assessment of time, concerns about content, and guidance about its developmental adequacy. Participants were 711 Spanish s of  in primary and secondary school. Results showed that the al attitudes and -rearing dimensions mostly differ according to the 's age, education and place of residence, mirroring the variables that modulate the s' digital divide. The 's schooling level and gender  modulate al attitudes and  dimensions. When controlling for 's age, 's schooling level and amount of time spent on line, the 's decision on Internet use positively predicted the assessment of time (AdjR(2) = .31), whereas the al decision on Internet use, more learning and less social motivation, and more control and warmth positively predicted both concerns (AdjR(2) = .25) and guidance (AdjR(2) = .40) about content. These  may help to design  education programs to help them discover not only the risks but  the opportunities for learning and leisure that the Internet opens up to the family. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Narcissistic traits in young people: understanding the role of parenting and maltreatment,2020,"Background Elevated narcissism in young people often sets up a cascade of interpersonal and mental health challenges, reinforcing the need to understand its concomitants. Experiences of maltreatment and different   have been implicated but findings to date are inconclusive. By simultaneously considering multiple remembered   and maltreatment in a large sample, this  aims to elucidate possible prognostic factors associated with both grandiose and vulnerable narcissistic traits in youth. Methods Young people (N = 328, age range: 17-25 years) reported on the remembered interpersonal environment and current grandiose and vulnerable narcissism traits. Structural equation modelling was used to examine maternal and paternal   and examine the association between experiences of  and grandiose and vulnerable narcissism. Results Remembered overprotection from mothers and fathers was associated with both vulnerable and grandiose narcissistic traits. Remembered maternal overvaluation related to current grandiosity, and maternal leniency related to vulnerable narcissistic traits. For paternal , the combination of overvaluation and leniency and overvaluation and care explained grandiose and vulnerable traits. There was no direct effect of remembered al care or hood maltreatment on current levels of narcissistic traits. Conclusions Remembered hood experiences of being overprotected, overvalued and experiencing leniency in al discipline, were associated with higher traits of pathological narcissism in young people. Care and maltreatment were non-specific risk factors. Remembered hood environments of being excessively pampered are associated with grandiose and vulnerable narcissistic traits, characterised by the young person expressing unrealistic self-views, entitlement beliefs and impaired autonomy. In treatment these traits may emerge in the patient-therapist relationship and working through their developmental origins may contribute to outcomes."

The interaction of perceived maternal and paternal parenting styles and their relation with the psychological distress and offending characteristics of incarcerated young offenders,2001,"A shortened form of the al Bonding Instrument (PBI) (Pederson, 1994) was used to examine the relationship between   and the psychological distress and offending patterns of a group of young male offenders held in custody in Scotland. High levels of psychological distress were linked with low al care, but there was no association between psychological distress and al control. al care was not a distinguishing factor in offending patterns, although high paternal control was linked with a younger age of first arrest. When interactions of paternal and maternal   were examined, young offenders who perceived poor  (i.e. neglectful  or affectionless control) from both s had the highest levels of psychological distress overall.

Diet-related restrictive parenting practices. Impact on dietary intake of 2-year-old  and interactions with  characteristics,2009,"This  examined the relationship between diet-related  practices, al characteristics,  characteristics, and 2-year-old 's dietary intake. Cross-sectional data (N = 2578) originated from the KOALA Birth Cohort Study. Principal component analyses revealed two restrictive  practice clusters: a cluster characterized by prohibition of the intake of various snacks and soft drinks, and a separate cluster characterized by prohibition of cookies and cake. Regression analyses showed that these Clusters were related to the 's behavioural  (i.e. oppositional, depressive and/or aggressive behaviour) and to educational level, age and alternative life of the mother. The clusters  had a favourable influence on dietary intake (i.e. restrictive  practices were related to less consumption of the restricted (unhealthy) items and higher consumption of items considered to be healthy), which was moderated by  characteristics. The  practices showed a stronger association with dietary intake in  with a favourable behavioural  (i.e. non-depressed, low anxious, low overactive), a favourable eating  or a lower BMI. The findings suggest opportunities for preventive interventions focussing on s of young , and indicate that different approaches to  practice interventions are needed for different types of .

Our aim is to investigate the impact of structural and process characteristics in the family on 's language proficiency. Our sample comprises 314 six-year-old  with and without a migration background. The  of a path analysis via multiple linear regressions reveal   as a mediator of family structural background. Structural equation models demonstrate that in native German families the SES explains 's verbal skills, whereas in migrant families stimulating activities are more important. Furthermore,   influences verbal skills independently of the family language. This is of methodological relevance as in operationalisations   is often insufficiently differentiated from stimulating activities."
Implementation and Evaluation of a Parenting Program to Prevent Child Maltreatment in Suriname,2018,"The prevention of  maltreatment has become a global health concern because  maltreatment is a violation of 's rights. Across the world, a variety of  programs have been developed to address this problem. However, no such  program currently exists in Suriname. This pilot  aimed to implement Lobi Mi Pikin (LMP)  program in Suriname and to evaluate its effects on corporal punishment (CP) and  behavioral problems. s-caregivers (N = 70) of  (ages 3-12 years) with externalizing behavioral problems participated in a protocoled  program. The 's behavioral problems and the   of the -caregiver were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the al Behavior Scale, pretreatment and posttreatment. Five-week follow-up measures revealed significant positive effects of LMP on all outcome measures. Follow-up comparisons demonstrated (a) a large reduction of total  difficulties and conduct problems, (b) a moderate reduction of hyperactivity and emotional problems, (c) a moderate to large increase in the self-reported positive behavior of the , and (d) a small decrease in the use of CP. This  provides preliminary evidence that LMP may be an effective model of  training in Suriname. Moreover, it can help guide efforts to reduce the use of CP and encourage positive , thereby preventing  maltreatment."
Single Mothers by Choice in Spain: Parenting and Psychosocial Adjustment in Adopted and ART Children,2021,"This  explores the effects of family structure (single mother by choice/partnered mother), pathway to motherhood (adoption/assisted reproduction techniques or ART), and   on 's psychological adjustment and social competence. Ninety-eight families participated: 45 single mothers by choice (29 adoptive, 16 by ART); and 53 partnered mothers (27 adoptive, 26 by ART). Ninety-eight  were evaluated (Age = 5.36) by their teachers. As regards family structure,  of single mothers by choice (both adopted and conceived by ART) showed good psychological adjustment and good social competence. No significant differences were observed between them and those living with two s when all were conceived by ART. However,  adopted by single mothers had higher hyperactivity and lower self-control than those living with two adoptive s. No differences were observed in terms of nurturing  , either between single and partnered mothers, or between adoptive and ART mothers. The nurturing   significantly predicted better psychological adjustment and social competence among .

Uninvolved Maternal Feeding Style Moderates the Association of Emotional Overeating to Preschoolers' Body Mass Index z-Scores,2016,"Objective: To examine the relation between preschoolers' eating behaviors and body mass index (BMI) z-scores (BMIz) and the moderating role of permissive  feeding  in these associations. Design: Cross-sectional  involving mothers' report of food-related   and  eating behaviors. Setting: Small city in southern Mississippi. Participants: Mother-preschooler dyads (n = 104). Main Outcome Measure: Child body BMIz. Analysis: Moderated multiple regression. Results: An uninvolved feeding  moderated the relationship between emotional eating and BMIz such that  with higher emotional overeating scores had higher a BMIz in the presence of an uninvolved feeding  (B = 2.16; P = .01). Conclusions and Implications: An uninvolved feeding  may be a risk factor for higher BMIz in preschoolers who tend to overeat to cope with negative emotions. For other  in this population, self-regulatory aspects of eating may be more important than mothers' feeding  in the maintenance of healthy weight."
Emotion-Related Parenting Styles (ERPS): A Short Form for Measuring Parental Meta-Emotion Philosophy,2012,"Research Findings: s' meta-emotion philosophy guides their approach to teaching their  about emotions (J. M. Gottman, L. F. Katz, & C. Hooven, 1997) and is measured with the Emotion-Related  Styles Self-Test-Likert (Gottman et al., 1997, modified by J. Hakim-Larson, A. Parker, C. Lee, J. Goodwin, & S. Voelker, 2006). The purpose of this  was to explore the underlying structure of this measure, develop a short form, and assess its psychometric properties. In a sample of 107 s of typically developing , principal factor extraction with a direct oblimin rotation (delta 0) identified 3 factors: emotion coaching, al acceptance of negative emotion, and al rejection of negative emotion. In a sample of 107 s of  with developmental disabilities, a 4th factor was identified: feelings of uncertainty/ineffectiveness in emotion socialization. The 4-factor, 20-item short form showed good validity and reliability, with Cronbach's alphas ranging from .70 to .80. Practice or Policy: This short form is a practical means of assessment and may be used to identify s of typically developing  who perceive similar challenges with their 's emotions as do s who have  with developmental disabilities. The discussion centers on potential emotion-related  practices and the identification of  at risk for emotion regulation difficulties."
Are Mindful Parents More Authoritative and Less Authoritarian? An Analysis of Clinic-Referred Mothers,2010,"Forty clinic-referred mothers completed questionnaires describing their 's problems, the mothers'  , and their everyday mindfulness. Psychometric analyses of the questionnaires showed mother reports to be internally consistent, except for one of the   scales (i.e., permissive ). We dropped the scale and analyzed intercorrelations between the remaining two scales, the mindfulness measure and the  problem measure. Results showed the authoritative and authoritarian scales were not correlated, and each scale covaried with measures of mindfulness and  problems. Regression analyses revealed two pathways between mothers' mindfulness and  problems. Both pathways showed   to mediate the connections between mothers' mindfulness and their perceptions of  problems. We speculated on the nature of the mediating process."
Parenting and community background and variation in women's life-history development,2006,"For a community sample of 623 low-income women (mean age = 26.9 years), the authors use life-history theory to explore relations between  and community background and timing of reproductive development and sexual behaviors. Among other patterns, reported levels of paternal involvement during hood were related to delayed menarche and ages at 1st sexual intercourse and 1st birth. The relation between al investment and women's reproductive delay varied with estimates of wealth in the community in which the participants grew up. The  suggest that s increased their investment as the level of community wealth increased, and in ways that likely facilitated women's ability to compete for social status in adulthood. Implications for future  on the relation between  and  outcomes are discussed."

The Mediating Role of Parenting Stress in the Relations Between Parental Emotion Regulation and Parenting Behaviors in Chinese Families of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Dyadic Analysis,2019,"Little is known regarding the dynamic interactions between fathers and mothers in families of  with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) during the  process. This  used an actor-partner interdependence mediation (APIMeM) model to investigate the intrapersonal and interpersonal effects of emotion dysregulation and  stress on  behaviors among 211 pairs (total N = 422) of Chinese s of  with ASD. The  indicated that for both fathers and mothers, there were significant indirect actor effects of al emotion dysregulation on s' own  behaviors through their own  stress. However, no significant direct or indirect partner effect was found in the analyses. These findings suggest that the emotional  dynamics occurred on the individual rather than the dyadic level in these families."

Do maternal parenting practices predict problematic patterns of adolescent alcohol consumption?,2010,"Objective This  examines whether a mother's  of  at  age 5 years predicts problematic patterns of drinking in adolescence, after controlling for relevant individual, maternal and social risk factors. Methods Data were used from the Mater-University Study of Pregnancy, an Australian longitudinal  of mothers and their  from pregnancy to when the  were 14 years of age. Logistic regression analyses examined whether maternal  practices at  age 5 predicted problematic drinking patterns in adolescence, after controlling for a range of confounding covariates. Results Physical punishment at  age 5 did not predict adolescent alcohol problems at follow-up. Results indicated that low maternal control at  age 5 predicted adolescent occasional drinking patterns at age 14. More frequent maternal partner change coupled with lower levels of control was the strongest predictor of more problematic patterns of drinking by adolescents. Conclusions These findings highlight the importance of family structure and level of al control in the development of problematic patterns of drinking in adolescence."
Application of the Parenting Research Partnership Model to an Evidence-Based Case Study Approach,2017,"This evidence-based case  explores the impact of an 8-week  intervention among diverse s with young  who attended an urban, community-based  program. The case  consists of a group pretest/posttest design with the intervention program as the manipulation. As such, the community-based pilot program forms the case  rather than a clinical case. The unique benefits of an evidence-based case  approach are ed. Data analyses include correlations to examine relationships among variables at Time 1 and at Time 2 and within-subjects t tests to analyze differences between participants' responses pre- and postintervention participation for variables that reflect  ,  competence, and the experience of being the  of a baby. Results indicate 2 significant subscale changes (i.e., Life Change and Centrality) between Time 1 and Time 2. Changes are thought to indicate a shift toward positive .

Parental intervention style and adult sibling conflicts: The mediating role of involvement in sibling bullying,2019,"Managing conflicts and aggressive behaviors between siblings is challenging for many s, and al responses to sibling conflict has been shown to influence the quality of 's sibling interactions. Building on previous work on al involvement in sibling conflict, the aim of this  was to investigate the mediating role of sibling bullying perpetration and victimization during hood and adolescence in the relationship between al intervention  and conflicts in young adults' sibling relationships. A sample of 302 individuals aged 17-33 years participated in the . Results of structural equation modeling confirmed the proposed mediation model of young adults' sibling conflicts. More precisely, al control and al noninvolvement were positively associated with experiences of sibling bullying perpetration and victimization, whereas al coaching was associated with lower reports of sibling victimization. Involvement in sibling bullying during hood and adolescence was, for its part, associated with sibling conflicts in young adulthood. Results of the current  confirmed that  intervention  can influence 's involvement in sibling bullying, which in turn, can predict conflicts in adult sibling relationships. In line with the family system theory, these  underline that s can inadvertently play a role in the development of dysfunctional sibling relationships."
Adolescents With Congenital Heart Disease: The Importance of Perceived Parenting for Psychosocial and Health Outcomes,2011,"Objective: Little is known about how  relates to psychosocial functioning and health behavior in adolescents with congenital heart disease (CHD). Different   were identified through relying on adolescent perceptions of multiple dimensions (regulation, responsiveness, and psychological control). The degree to which s were perceived as consistent in their rearing  was assessed. Method: Adolescents with CHD were selected from the database of pediatric and congenital cardiology of the University Hospitals Leuven; control individuals were recruited at secondary schools. A total of 429 adolescents (14-18 years) with CHD participated; 403 were matched on gender and age with control individuals. Adolescents completed questionnaires on maternal and paternal regulation, psychological control, and responsiveness. Main outcome measures were depressive symptoms, loneliness, quality of life, health status, alcohol, cigarette, and drug use. Results: No significant differences emerged between adolescents with CHD and controls in perceived  . Democratic  was accompanied by the most optimal pattern of outcomes in adolescents with CHD, whereas psychologically controlling  by the least optimal pattern. Overprotective  was related to high patient substance use. Perceiving both s as democratic turned out most favorably for psychosocial functioning and quality of life, whereas al consistency was unrelated to substance use in adolescents with CHD. Discussion: By building bridges between the fields of adolescent medicine and family studies, the   generated important information on the role of s in psychosocial and behavioral functioning of adolescents with CHD. Future longitudinal studies could inform family-based interventions for this population. (J Dev Behav Pediatr 32:651-659, 2011)"
Longitudinal Associations Between Parenting and Child Big Five Personality Traits,2021,"The goal of this  was to explore the relationships between four  dimensions (academic involvement, structure, cultural stimulation, and goals) and  personality development. Many theories, such as social learning, attachment theory, and the psychological resources principle assume that  practices influence  personality development. Most of past  on the associations between  and  Big Five traits specifically has used cross-sectional data. The few longitudinal studies that examined these associations found small relations between  and  personality. We extended this  by examining the long-term relations between four underexplored  dimensions and  Big Five personality traits using bivariate latent growth models in a large longitudinal dataset (N = 3,880). Results from growth models revealed a preponderance of null relations between these  measures and  personality, especially between changes in  and changes in  personality. In general, the observed associations between  and  Big Five personality were comparable in magnitude to the association between factors such as SES and birth order, and  personality-that is, small. The small associations between environmental factors and personality suggest that personality development in hood and adolescence may be driven by multiple factors, each of which makes a small contribution."
COPING STRATEGIES OF FATHERS IN EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES AND PARENTING STRESS LEVELS,2020,"We evaluated the relationship between (1) the coping strategies used by fathers of  receiving early intervention services and (2) the stress fathers experience as a  of  rearing. One-hundred and forty-four fathers from 17 early intervention centers in the Valencian Autonomous Community (Spain) participated in the . We measured the fathers '  stress and coping strategies using the  Stress Index-SF (PSI-SF) and the Adult Coping Response Inventory (CRI-A), respectively. Structural equation models were created to assess the simultaneous effects of -related variables and the fathers' sociodemographic variables on  stress, mediated by the fathers' coping strategies. The coping strategy Positive Reappraisal was negatively related to all the PSI-SF stress factors and the total score. Therefore, more frequent use of Positive Reappraisal strategies was related to lower rates of  stress. In addition, the educational level of the father and the type of disability of the  were related to the fathers'  stress and the coping strategies they used, principally, Avoidant Coping Styles. Fathers of  receiving early intervention services could benefit from intervention programs that consider coping strategies for  stress, contributing, in this way, to increasing the fathers' perception of their  competence."
Authoritative Parenting of Chinese Mothers of Children with and without Intellectual Disability,2017,"The   examined authoritative  and associations with  sense of competence and social support in Chinese mothers of  with intellectual disability and mothers of typically developing . One hundred and sixty-seven mothers of  with intellectual disability with a mean age of 10.89 years (SD = 1.74) and 119 mothers of typically developing  with a mean age of 10.55 years (SD = 1.10) participated in a survey. Mothers of  with intellectual disability reported similar levels of al warmth, and less use of reasoning and autonomy support compared with mothers of typically developing .  efficacy contributed uniquely to three dimensions of authoritative  for mothers of  with intellectual disability. By comparison,  efficacy did not contribute to use of reasoning and autonomy support for mothers of typically developing . Social support made a unique but small contribution to al warmth but not to al reasoning and autonomy support for mothers of  with intellectual disability. For mothers of typically developing , social support was associated with both al warmth and autonomy support. This  suggests that  disability status is related to maternal authoritative , and additionally,  efficacy plays a more critical role in predicting authoritative  of Chinese mothers of  with intellectual disability than mothers of typically developing ."
One Day I Will Make a Good Parent: On The Relationship Between Overparenting and Young Adults' Early Parenting Representations,2017,"Early  reations are likely to affect future , and it is therefore important to investigate their predictors. In this , we focused on one dimension of early  reations, i.e., perceived ability to relate well to  (PARC) in young adults who are not yet s, and examined whether this was associated with their own s' over. In addition, we investigated whether this association was mediated by young adults' attachment  and perceived general interpersonal problems. Questionnaires were collected from 96 triads (mothers, fathers, young adults; 50% male) comprising intact families. Over dimensions were not consistently associated with PARC. First, significant associations with PARC were observed only for maternal over. Second, higher levels of maternal anticipatory problem solving were significantly associated with lower levels of PARC, whereas higher levels of maternal advice/affect management were significantly associated with higher levels of PARC. These associations were significantly mediated (partially) by levels of secure attachment  and (completely) by levels of dismissive attachment . Dimensions of maternal over and their interplay with young adult offspring's attachment might have a part in the formation of young adults' early  reations. Prevention initiatives could be set up to inform young adults' s about the drawbacks of over, and young adults themselves about possible coping mechanisms."

The  of correlation analysis indicated a positive and significant correlation between school climate dimensions (teacher support, autonomy support and students support), and positive youth development and a positive and significant correlation between perception of  dimensions ( engagement, warmth and autonomy support) and positive youth development. In addition, the  of stepwise regression indicated that  engagement, teacher support and  autonomy explain 40% of the changes of positive youth development."
Advancing Understanding of Autism within Families: Caregiver Broader Autism Phenotype Traits Differentially Relate to Parenting Behavior,,"Although caregiver characteristics such as personality and psychopathology strongly relate to , little is known about how a caregiver's own autistic or broader autism phenotype (BAP) traits relate to  practices. This is a significant gap in our understanding of individual differences in  given the rising prevalence of autism diagnoses among adults, with higher levels of the population reporting subclinical traits related to autism (i.e., BAP traits of aloofness, pragmatic language difficulties, and rigidity). To further our understanding of families wherein caregivers identify as autistic or as having autistic traits, we examined (1) whether caregiver BAP traits, considered both categorically and continuously, were associated with  practices; (2) how the three distinct BAP traits differentially related to , and (3) whether BAP traits were associated with  over and above other mental health symptoms. Caregivers (n = 138) reported on BAP traits, multiple domains of  using the Alabama  Questionnaire and the al Emotion Style Questionnaire, and co-occurring attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) traits and internalizing symptoms. BAP traits were associated with  both categorically and continuously, with the three BAP subscales showing differential associations with  outcomes, even when controlling for internalizing symptoms and ADHD traits. Aloofness was associated with lower scores on measures of emotion dismissing, positive , and involvement, whereas pragmatic language difficulties were associated with lower scores on emotion coaching and higher scores on poor monitoring. Rigidity was uniquely associated with higher scores on emotion dismissing. Implications for advancing understanding of individual differences in , considering systemic and contextual influences on , and supporting  in the general population and for autistic adults are discussed."
Effects of perceived affectionless control parenting on working models of the self and other,2016,"Attachment theory contends that insecure working models of the self and other built through negative attachment experiences are predisposing factors for depression and anxiety disorders. Meanwhile, patients with these psychiatric disorders tend to perceive that they received the affectionless control , which is a combination of lack of care and overprotection. To test the hypothesis that the affectionless control  impairs the formation of positive working models, we examined the effects of perceived   on qualities of working models. The subjects were 691 healthy Japanese volunteers. Working models of the self and other were assessed by the Relationship Scales Questionnaire. Perceived al rearing was evaluated by the al Bonding Instrument, which has the care and protection subscales. al rearing was classified into one of the four types defined by combinations of levels of care and protection. In all combinations of recipient sexes and al sexes, the subjects with the affectionless control  (low care/high protection) had lower scores of the self-model and other-model than those with the optimal  (high care/low protection). The   suggests that the affectionless control  impairs the formation of positive working models of the self and other. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
Dog Owners' Interaction Styles: Their Components and Associations with Reactions of Pet Dogs to a Social Threat,2016,"The bond dogs develop with their owner received increased attention in the last years but no  aimed at characterizing the way in which owners interact with their dogs in their daily life and how this might influence dog behavior. In order to examine how dog owners interact with their dogs, we first analyzed the behavior of 220 dog owners in 8 different standardized situations involving the owner-dog dyad. We extracted 3 behavioral factors related to Owner Warmth, Owner Social Support, and Owner Control. Further, we investigated whether owner personality, gender and age are associated with these three factors. Results indicated that older owners scored lower in Owner Warmth and in Owner Social Support and higher in Owner Control than younger owners. Furthermore, owners scoring high in Owner Control scored lower in the personality trait Openness and owners scoring high in Owner Social Support scored lower in the personality trait Conscientiousness. Finally, we  analyzed whether the dogs' reaction to an unfamiliar woman's threatening approach was associated with the owners' interaction . Results showed that dogs that searched for proximity of their owners during the threatening situation had owners scoring higher in Owner Warmth, as compared to dogs that reacted more autonomously, approaching the unfamiliar experimenter. Analogies between dog owner interaction  and human   are discussed considering the implications of the  findings for human social psychology as well as the practical relevance for dog welfare and human safety."
Sustained Effectiveness of Evidence-Based Parenting Programs After the Research Trial Ends,2018,"Despite ample evidence of the efficacy and effectiveness of evidence-based  programs (EBPPs) within -led environments, there is very little evidence of maintenance of effectiveness when programs are delivered as part of regular service provision. The   examined the effectiveness of EBPPs provided during a period of sustained service-led implementation in comparison to -led effectiveness evaluation. Data from 3706 s who received EBPPs during sustained implementation by services were compared to data from 1390 s who had participated in an earlier er-led effectiveness trial of a national roll-out of EBPPs in England. In both phases, s completed measures of  behavior problems,   and al mental well-being prior to starting  programs (pretest), at the end of the programs (post) and at 12-months follow up. Results from Generalized Estimating Equations controlling for potential covariates indicated significant improvements in  behavior problems during sustained implementation, similar to the effectiveness phase; significant improvements in   which were larger than the effectiveness phase at 12-month follow up; and significant improvements in al mental well-being. Our findings demonstrate effective maintenance of gains when EBPPs are provided as part of regular provision across a large sample of English s. Successful long-term implementation should consider effectiveness of EBPPs across the population, given the large contextual changes that take place between er-led evaluations and service take-up. Our findings support the integration of EBPPs in public health approaches to addressing  behavior problems and  well-being."
"Domain-specific Parenting Practices and Adolescent Self-esteem, Problem Behaviors, and Competence",2019,"In  socialization , it has been suggested that the specific practices s apply to regulate different domains or areas of adolescents' lives be examined to add greater specificity to domain-general studies of   or patterns and to better understand the link between  practices and adolescent adjustment. We examined from adolescents' perspectives the  practices their mothers and fathers used when regulating different issues in different areas of adolescents' lives. We examined 18 issues (e.g., grades, platonic friendship; smoking, fighting with siblings, choice of future career), classified into the moral, conventional, personal, and prudential domains, and multifaceted issues (issues that share features of more than one domain). We  examined whether domain variations in  practices are related to adolescents' social and academic competence; self-esteem; internalizing, externalizing, attention, and total problems. Adolescents between 13 to 18 years of age (N=182; M=16.01 years of age; SD=1.25) were interviewed (50 to 75min) about the  practices their mothers and fathers employ for different issues. Adolescents  completed questionnaires on demographics and on their social and academic competence; self-esteem; internalizing, externalizing, attention, and total problems. Adolescent adjustment associated with some  practices (e.g., punishment) were domain-specific (e.g., positive in moral domain but negative in prudential domain). However, certain  practices (e.g., verbal hostility, coercion) were related to negative adjustment and others to positive adjustment (e.g., monitoring) irrespective of domains. The   advances theoretical propositions regarding domain-specificity and domain generality of  practices."
Socialization Effects of Authoritative Parenting and Its Discrepancy on Children,2016,"Authoritative  provided by the  and received by the  offers support and demand to socialize the , possibly in terms of the performance of taking others' perspectives and self-esteem. Nevertheless, when the  receives less authoritative  than the  claims to provide, a discrepancy in authoritative  between the - pair happens and would be likely to reduce the performance. Such impacts on the performance are the focus of this . Based on cross-sectional data collected from 223  (aged 14-21 years) and their s through self-administered questionnaires,  analyzed from structural equation modeling show that (1) authoritative s, based on the reports of both the  and , engendered a positive direct effect on the 's perspective taking, which in turn sustained a positive effect on the 's self-esteem; (2) discrepancy in authoritative  between the - pair indicated negative direct effects on both the 's perspective taking and self-esteem; and (3) the 's perspective taking significantly mediated, although not totally, the effects of authoritative  and its discrepancy on the 's self-esteem. The   supports the propositions of symbolic-interactionist theory in explanation of the importance of authoritative  and its discrepancy in relation to the 's development of perspective taking and self-esteem. Implications and future  directions are discussed."
Residential Mobility and Change and Continuity in Parenting Processes,2015,"This  investigates the association between residential mobility and changes in   and al monitoring using panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 on adolescents aged 14-18 (N=2,631). Logistic and multinomial logistic regression  indicate that moving is significantly associated with an increase in al monitoring for fathers and sons, but not mothers and daughters. Residential mobility is  associated with changes in   for mothers and fathers. However, specific changes in   for residentially mobile mothers and fathers depend upon the   exhibited before the move. These changes  depend upon the gender composition of the - relationship."
"A Conceptual Analysis of Food Parenting Practices in the Light of Self-Determination Theory: Relatedness-Enhancing, Competence-Enhancing and Autonomy-Enhancing Food Parenting Practices",2018,"The relationships between  behaviors and  obesity or obesogenic eating behaviors (i.e., overeating unhealthy food) have been studied through the use of different  constructs; in particular, specific food  practices have been extensively investigated, but there is currently a need for a more comprehensive and integrative theoretical framework to guide future investigations. The  article argues for the use of Self-determination theory as a valuable framework to conceptually organize food  practices relevant to 's obesogenic eating behaviors. The three  dimensions of positive al involvement, autonomy support and provision of structure - highlighted by Self-determination theory as closely linked to the process of internalization of healthy behaviors and values by the  - will be adopted as a framework to categorize food  practices into three types of practices:relatedness-enhancing, competence-enhancing and autonomy-enhancing."
"An examination of emotion regulation, temperament, and parenting style as potential predictors of adolescent depression risk status: A correlational study",2009,"Given that depression is a debilitating disorder, it is critical that we advance our understanding about the aetiology of this disorder. This  investigated both traditional (temperament and ) and novel (emotion regulation strategy) risk factors associated with adolescent depression. Forty-four adolescents (12-16 years; 64% females) with high scores on a self-report depressive symptomatology questionnaire were compared to a similar group of 44 adolescents with low scores, matched for age, gender, and ethnicity. Significant group differences were  on all assessed risk factors. The presence of high depressive symptomatology was found to be associated with (1) low levels of temperamentally based positive mood, flexibility, and approach behaviours, (2) a   characterized by low nurturance and high overprotection, and (3) emotion regulation characterized by higher levels of expressive suppression and lower levels of cognitive reappraisal. It was concluded that, in addition to specific temperament characteristics and  , use of particular emotion regulation strategies is associated with varying levels of depressive symptomatology. These findings reinforce the importance of incorporating emotion regulation into explanatory models of depression symptomatology. Further  that tests the direction of effects for these cross-sectional findings is warranted."
"Retrospective Reports of Perceived 'Guan' Parenting: Relationships to Adult Attachment Styles, Emotion Regulation, and Self-Esteem",2021,"To determine how al guan is related to social-emotional development in adulthood and how demographic controls might influence the prediction of al guan on social-emotional development, 176 adults completed a series of questionnaires. We expected that both maternal and paternal guan would be positively related to secure attachment in adulthood, emotion regulation, self-esteem, and social self-esteem, but negatively related to avoidance and anxious attachment in adulthood. Pearson correlations largely supported these expectations. Moreover, the  of hierarchical regression analyses indicated that paternal guan was positively related to self-esteem but negatively related to anxious attachment in adulthood. Maternal guan, on the other hand, significantly predicted emotion regulation. Both maternal and paternal guan were significantly related to secure adult attachment and social self-esteem. Age, gender, and family structure contributed additional variance in some variables. We discuss our  in terms of the protective role of guan  in a 's life."
"Attachment, mating, and parenting - An evolutionary interpretation",1997,"A modern evolutionary perspective emphasizing life history theory and behavioral ecology is brought to bear on the three core patterns of attachment that are identified in studies of infants and young  in the Strange Situation and adults using the Adult Attachment Interview. Mating and  correlates of secure/autonomous, avoidant/dismissing, and resistant/preoccupied attachment patterns are reviewed, and the argument is advanced that security evolved to promote mutually beneficial interpersonal relations and high investment ; that avoidant/ dismissing attachment evolved to promote opportunistic interpersonal relations and low-investment ; and that resistant/preoccupied attachment evolved to foster ''helper-at-the-nest'' behavior and indirect reproduction."
"Relationships With Parents, Identity Styles, and Positive Youth Development During the Transition From Adolescence to Emerging Adulthood",2018,"The purpose of this  was to examine the links between relationships with s, identity , and positive youth development (PYD), conceptualized as contribution to self, family, and community, in Lithuanian youth during the transition from adolescence to emerging adulthood. In Study I, we sought to examine how positive relationships with s predict contribution with the potential mediating role of autonomy-supportive . Participants (N = 153) filled a self-reported questionnaire in the final year of school and 1 year later. In Study II, we aimed at investigating how al autonomy support is related to the contribution and the potential mediating role of identity processing . Participants (N = 254) were assessed 1 year after graduating high school. Overall, the findings indicated that positive relationships with s play an important role in successful adjustment and that this relationship is partially mediated by identity . To conclude, the way in which s respond to their 's need for autonomy and relatedness affects the adequate identity management and overall positive development during emerging adulthood."
Recent Alcohol Use and Binge Drinking Based on Authoritative Parenting Among Hispanic Youth Nationwide,2015,"  influence youth's overall well-being and behaviors. Few studies have examined the effects of   on alcohol use among Hispanic youth. Although the field of alcohol prevention has made progress in recent years, most prevention initiatives lack the capability to directly address the special needs of this high-risk population. The primary aim of our  was to examine the relationship of recent alcohol use, binge drinking (past 30 days) and authoritative  among Hispanic youth. We conducted a secondary data analysis of the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data in the  . All Hispanic participants from 12 to 17 years of age (N = 3,457) completed the valid and reliable survey in the privacy of their own homes. The university-based Institutional Review Board granted approval to conduct this . A total of 13.8 % of Hispanic youth reported recent alcohol use, and 8.0 % of these participants reported binge drinking. Hispanic youth who reported having low authoritative  was at significantly increased odds for reporting both recent alcohol use and binge drinking. Specifically, Hispanic youth with low authoritative  that were at increased risk for reporting alcohol use included males, females, the age group 14-15 years, and the age group 16-17 years compared to their counterparts with high authoritative . Results from our  can be used to assist prevention specialists in more thoroughly understanding the protective influence authoritative  has on Hispanic youth involvement in alcohol use."
Bidirectional Associations Between Mothers' and Fathers' Parenting Consistency and Child BMI,2013,"BACKGROUND: Research suggests that general  dimensions and  are associated with 's BMI, but directionality in this relationship remains unknown. Moreover, there has been little attention to the influences of both mothers' and fathers' . We aimed to examine reciprocal relationships between maternal and paternal  consistency and  BMI. METHODS: Participants were 4002  and their s in the population-based Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. Mothers and fathers self-reported  consistency, and 's BMI was measured at 4 biennial waves starting at age 4 to 5 years in 2004. Bidirectionality between  and  BMI was examined by using regression analyses in cross-lagged models. RESULTS: The best-fitting models indicated a modest influence from  to  BMI, whereas no support was found for bidirectional influences. For mothers, higher levels of  consistency predicted lower BMI in  from Waves 1 to 2 and 3 to 4; for example, for every SD increase in mothers'  consistency at Wave 1,  BMIz fell by 0.025 in Wave 2 (95% confidence interval: -0.05 to -0.003). For fathers, higher levels of  consistency were associated with lower  BMI from Waves 1 to 2 and 2 to 3. CONCLUSIONS:  inconsistency of mothers and fathers prospectively predicted small increases in offspring BMI over 2-year periods across middle hood. However,  BMI did not appear to influence  behavior. These findings support recent calls for expanding hood overweight interventions to address the broad  context while involving both mothers and fathers."
Assessing the psychometric properties of mother and father forms of the helicopter parenting behaviors questionnaire in a Turkish sample,,"Helicopter  is defined as the behaviors of s that include over-responsibility, control, and protection towards the life of their . Helicopter  is a relatively new phenomenon in the literature and has a significant role in the lives of adolescents and emerging adults. Therefore, several self-reports assessing helicopter  have been developed and tested recently. One of these self-reports, the Helicopter  Behaviors Questionnaire (HPBQ), was developed by Schiffrin et al. (2014) to evaluate perceived helicopter  and autonomy supportive behaviors of mothers. The current  aimed to examine the psychometric properties of the Turkish version of the HPBQ. The scale was  adapted separately for assessing perceived maternal and paternal helicopter  behaviors in the Turkish sample. Three hundred twenty-four college students (N-female = 165, N-male = 157), aged between 17 and 27 years (M = 20.57, SD = 1.99), filled in HPBQ - Mother and Father Forms, Helicopter  Instrument (HPI), Behavioral Control Scale-Youth Self Report (BCS-YSR), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS). Results showed that the original two-factor structure (helicopter  and autonomy supportive behaviors) of the Mother and Father Forms of HPBQ are supported, and independent confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) indicated that the two-factor structure of the questionnaire fits the data reasonably well. The Turkish version of HPBQ demonstrated convergent and divergent validity, as well as satisfactory internal consistency. The two forms of the questionnaire allow us to evaluate differences between maternal and paternal   in helicopter  and conduct cross-cultural ."
Perceived parental food controlling practices are related to obesogenic or leptogenic  life style behaviors,2009,"To better understand whether the al food controlling practices pressure and restriction to eat are obesity preventing or obesity promoting, this  examined whether these  practices are related to other (food or non-food) areas that are generally regarded as obesogenic or leptogenic. Are these foods controlling practices more indicative of obesogenic or leptogenic  life  behaviors? in a sample of 7-12-year-old boys and girls (n = 943) the perceived al food controlling practices were related to various measures for unhealthy life . Using factor analysis we assessed whether there is a constellation of life behaviors that is potentially obesogenic or leptogenic. Remarkably, perceived al restriction and pressure loaded on two different factors. Perceived al restriction to eat had a negative loading on a factor that further comprised potential obesogenic  life  behaviors, such as snacking (positive loading), time spend with screen media (television or computer) (positive loadings) and frequency of fruit consumption (negative loading). Perceived al pressure to eat had a positive loading on a factor that further comprised potential leptogenic life  behaviors such as frequency of eating a breakfast meal and sporting (positive loadings). It is concluded that low perceived al restriction in regard to food may perhaps be a sign of more uninvolved, 'neglecting' or indulgent /obesogenic home environment, whereas high perceived al pressure to eat may be sign of a more 'concerned' leptogenic /home environment, though more  into  of  is needed.

A sample of 2,399 adolescents (50.2% boys and 49.8% girls) enrolled in schools in Andalusia, aged between 12 and 18 years (M= 14.63, SD = 1.91) participated in the . A MANOVA 4 x 2 x 2 was carried out. The  showed that high -to- violence was related to high levels of problematic use of social networking sites, alexithymia, and a more positive attitude towards the transgression of social norms. It was  found that adolescents from families with an indulgent  showed the lowest scores in problematic use of social networking sites, alexithymia, and positive attitude towards the transgression of social norms. Additionally, in situations of high -to- violence, girls had higher scores in problematic use of social networking sites and alexithymia than boys. Finally, the  and their practical implications are discussed."
Psychological control by parents is associated with a higher  weight,2011,"Objective. In this examination of the association between   and  weight, the neglected concept of 'psychological control' has been added to the generally accepted  dimensions 'support' and 'behavioural control'. Also explored is whether the potential association between  and  weight is moderated by socio-demographic variables ('s age/ethnicity, and 's education level). Methods. A cross-sectional  was performed among 1,665 - dyads. The 's mean age was 8 years. Their height and weight were measured to calculate their body mass index (BMI). s completed a questionnaire to measure the three  dimensions. Based on these dimensions, five   were defined: the authoritative, permissive, authoritarian, neglecting and rejecting  . Child BMI z-scores were regressed on  , adjusting for al BMI,  ethnicity, and 's education level. Results. Rejecting , characterized by high psychological control, low support and low behavioural control, is the only   significantly related to  BMI z-scores (beta = 0.074, p < 0.001). The positive association was not moderated by socio-demographic variables. Conclusions. By adding the dimension of psychological control to the concept of , this  has further elucidated the mechanisms whereby  may affect  weight. Demonstrating that 'rejecting ' is associated with a higher  weight, emphasizes the need for longitudinal studies in which   is measured three-dimensionally. Potential mediating effects of al feeding  and 's eating , as well as age moderation, should be included in these studies."
"Parenting goal pursuit is linked to emotional well-being, relationship quality, and responsiveness",2019,"The aim of the current  was to identify the goals underlying al care and how they are linked to s' sense of emotional well-being, relationship quality, and responsiveness to their 's needs. We examined the link between  goals and outcomes through surveying s cross-sectionally (Studies 1 to 3), in a 10-day daily experience  (Study 4), and by conducting an internal meta-analysis of all four studies (N-total = 1,906). In Studies 1 and 2, s were found to pursue four unique goals as captured by a new scale called the  Goals Scale (PGS). The PGS measures the four goals of  love and security,  development,  image, and  acceptance. In Study 3, each of the four goals was found to be meaningfully related to, while  being distinct from, other individual differences in  , other-focused orientations, self-focused orientations, and attachment . In a 10-day daily experience  (Study 4) as well as an internal meta-analysis across all four studies, each goal was found to be uniquely related to s' emotional well-being, relationship quality with their , and feelings of responsiveness to their 's needs. Daily and chronic pursuit of  love and security goals predicted greater emotional well-being, relationship quality, and responsiveness. In contrast, daily and chronic pursuit of  image goals predicted poorer emotional well-being, relationship quality, and responsiveness, especially at the chronic level. Child development goals predicted poorer emotional well-being and relationship quality, especially at the chronic level. And finally,  acceptance goals predicted more positive emotions in daily life only. These associations largely held after controlling for s' reports of 's mood and care difficulty. The current findings contribute to a growing body of  focused on understanding the joys and frustrations of ."
Contextualizing the Role of Intrusive Parenting in Toddler Behavior Problems and Emotion Regulation: Is More Always Worse?,2021,"Intrusive  has been traditionally considered a negative   and includes actions that are overly directive and controlling of 's behavior. However, current  aims to contextualize this  behavior. This  examined the relation between intrusive  and early hood behavior problems or emotion regulation, as well as the moderating role of race/ethnicity and developmental delay. Participants (n = 511: 47.4% male) were part of a larger, longitudinal Early Head Start , entitled Baby FACES, with a racially and ethnically diverse sample (40.1% White, 18.7% Black, and 41.2% Hispanic). Behavior problems and developmental delay were assessed via  report, while  intrusiveness and emotion regulation were rated by observers. More use of intrusive  at age 2 was associated with greater behavior problems and less emotion regulation at age 3. However, this relation was moderated by race/ethnicity and developmental level. Greater intrusiveness was related to increased behavior problems and poorer emotion regulation for White and Hispanic/Latino families: they were unrelated in Black families. Similarly, although intrusive  and behavior problems were positively associated at all developmental levels, the relation was strongest for  with typical development. Further, fewer maternal risk factors, being female. and being Hispanic/Latino were associated with higher emotion regulation, and more risk factors were associated with more behavior problems. These findings highlight the importance of considering how a 's context and development interact with  . Children may benefit from clinical assessment and intervention that considers this intersectionality."
How Similar are Mothers and Fathers of Young Children in Their Parenting Responses and Goals?,2015,"The toddler and preschool years  numerous  challenges. This  was designed to explore the extent to which mothers and fathers in dual-income families with toddler or preschool age  are similar in their  responses and in their  goals. Participants were 148 primarily professional, White (84.6 %), dual-income couples (mothers' M (age) = 33.1 years; fathers' M (age) = 35.5 years) with a first  between the ages of 18-60 months. s completed the Child Behavior Vignettes - Toddler and Preschool Version which yielded a measure of  responses and a measure of  goals. Child adjustment was measured by  reports on the Child Behavior Checklist. We calculated  similarity using Finn's r. Responses to  situations involving  misbehavior and  withdrawn behavior were examined. We found that s in dual-income families were similar in their  responses and in their  goals. However the degree of similarity in  responses was not related to similarity in goals; furthermore, the degree of similarity was not linked to  adjustment. We offer possible interpretations for these findings and future  directions."
Risk Factors for Women's Intimate Partner Violence Victimization: An Examination from the Perspective of the Schema Therapy Model,2017,"This  attempted to examine risk factors for intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization against women in terms of the schema therapy model (STM). Seventy-nine shelter-residing female IPV victims and 78 married female IPV non-victims participated in the . The Young Schema Questionnaire Short Form, the Young  Inventory, the Young Compensation Inventory, and the Young Avoidance Inventory were used.

"Gender-Specific Mediational Links Between Parenting Styles, Parental Monitoring, Impulsiveness, Drinking Control, and Alcohol-Related Problems",2011,"Objective: Recently, it has been suggested that traits may dynamically change as conditions change. One possible mechanism that may influence impulsiveness is al monitoring. al monitoring reflects a knowledge regarding one's offspring's whereabouts and social connections. The aim of this investigation was to examine potential gender-specific al influences to impulsiveness (general behavioral control), control over one's own drinking (specific behavioral control), and alcohol-related problems among individuals in a period of emerging adulthood. Method: Direct and mediational links between   (permissive, authoritarian, and authoritative), al monitoring, impulsiveness, drinking control, and alcohol-related problems were investigated. A multiple-group, SEM model with (316 women, 265 men) university students was examined. Results: In general, the overall pattern among male and female respondents was distinct. For daughters, perceptions of a permissive father were indirectly linked to more alcohol-related problems through lower levels of monitoring by fathers and more impulsive symptoms. Perceptions of an authoritative father were  indirectly linked to fewer impulsive symptoms through higher levels of monitoring by fathers among daughters. For men, perceptions of a permissive mother were indirectly linked to more alcohol-related problems through lower levels of monitoring by mothers and more impulsive symptoms. For sons, perceptions of mother authoritativeness were indirectly linked to fewer alcohol-related problems through more monitoring by mothers and fewer impulsive symptoms. Conclusions: Monitoring by an opposite-gender  mediated the link between   (i.e., permissive, authoritative) on impulsiveness. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs. 72. 247-258, 2011)"
Maternal Feeding Styles and Food Parenting Practices as Predictors of Longitudinal Changes in Weight Status in Hispanic Preschoolers from Low-Income Families,2016,"Objective. The aim was to investigate the influence of feeding  and food  practices on low-income 's weight status over time. Method. Participants were 129 Latina s and their Head Start  participating in a longitudinal . Children were assessed at baseline (4 to 5 years old) and again eighteen months later. At each time point, s completed questionnaires and height and weight measures were taken on the . Results. The indulgent feeding  (-report at baseline) was associated with increased  BMI z-score eighteen months later compared to other feeding . Authoritative, authoritarian, and uninvolved feeding  were not significantly associated with increased  BMI z-score. Child BMI z-score at Time 1 (strongest) and maternal acculturation were positive predictors of  BMI z-score at Time 2. Maternal use of restriction positively predicted and maternal monitoring negatively predicted Time 2 BMI z-score, but only when accounting for feeding . Conclusion. This is the first  to investigate the impact of feeding  on  weight status over time. Results suggest that indulgent feeding predicts later increases in 's weight status. The interplay between feeding  and food  practices in influencing  weight status needs to be further explored."
Perceived Parenting Practices and Adjustment: Moderation by Cultural Values in Chinese Emerging Adults,2017,"Filial piety is an important cultural construct in the lives and behaviors of Chinese emerging adults and may act as a moderating factor for the relationship between perceived  practices and indices of adjustment. The purpose of this  was to investigate whether or not filial piety moderates the influence of psychologically controlling and warm  behaviors on internalizing problems, self-esteem, and risk behaviors. Using a sample of Chinese college students (N = 612),  from regression analyses indicated that filial piety moderated the relationship between psychological control and self-esteem, in that psychological control predicted lower self-esteem at high and moderate levels of filial piety values but was not related at low filial piety values. The discussion focuses on the possibility that filial piety may exacerbate the conflict between psychologically controlling tactics and autonomy."
Parental style and gendered student performance in the South African context of accounting studies,2018,"The purpose of this  was to investigate the potentially gendered influence of experienced al authority  on individual accounting students' academic performance at a large South African university. Data were collected from first-year accountancy students and 953 usable responses were analysed using structural equation modelling. Tests of path invariance were  used to test the moderating influence of gender on the relationships between exposure to   and student performance. Exposure to an authoritarian al  was found to be negatively associated with student performance. Gender was found to moderate the relationship between exposure to authoritative   and student performance. Experience of an authoritarian al  was found to be associated with a host of variables reing socio-economic disadvantage. On the basis of these , it was concluded that the influence of legacy al  effects may be persistent for individuals who enter university for accountancy studies."

Parenting behaviors and  psychopathy: A regression mixture analysis,,"The current  examined the associations between the profile of  behaviors and  psychopathy using a person-centered approach. Regression mixture modeling (RMM) was employed to explore the predictive ability of  behavior profiles on  psychopathy in a sample (N = 361, 51.9 % female) of 9 to 13-year-old Chinese  (M = 10.42, SD = 0.94). Results demonstrated that two subgroups were identified which best characterized the mother-reported  behaviors (positive 40%, negative 60%) and three subtypes were identified to characterize the father-reported  behaviors (positive 20%, negative 18%, mixture 62%). Children with a higher level of psychopathic traits were more often subjected to the negative  behavior profile than they were to positive or mixture  behavior profiles. The findings of this  advance the understanding of different  behaviors in predicting  psychopathy in non-Western cultural context. We  discuss the implications these findings have for clinicians working to decrease the risk of  psychopathy."
"Peer Victimization, Supportive Parenting, and Depression Among Adolescents in South Korea: A Longitudinal Study",2018,"Purpose: The aims of this  were to examine relationships among peer victimization, supportive , and depression in South Korean adolescents and the moderating effect of supportive  on the peer victimization-depression relationship. Methods: Data were drawn fromthe Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey performed from 2010 to 2016. The first-year middle-school panel collected from the first year of middle school to the first year of university was used, and the final sample size was 1750. Generalized estimating equation models were employed to examine relationships among peer victimization, supportive , and depression. Results: About 6% of participants reported the experience of peer victimization at least once during the previous year. Females were more likely to report higher level of depression compared to males. Participants who were from lower family income, reported the past experience of peer victimization, and reported less supportive weremore likely to report higher level of depression compare to the counterpart. Themoderating effect of supportive  on the association between peer victimization and depression was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Participants who had experienced of peer victimization and less supportive  showed higher levels of depression. The supportive  did not have significant moderating effect on the relationship between peer victimization and depression. Practice Implications: Future  on adolescent depression should include development of interventions targeting both adolescent students' behaviors and their s'  of  aimed at the reducing the rate of peer victimization and the level of depression among adolescents in South Korea.

Adult attachment and perceived parental style may shape leadership behaviors,2018,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of both attachment and al  in shaping leadership behavioral patterns. Research predictions were that hood perceived al experiences will be associated with attachment , and that both perceived al and attachment  will fulfill a significant role in shaping the individual's leadership orientation in adulthood. Design/methodology/approach The authors tested the  hypotheses with a field survey data from 90 supervisors belonging to diverse industrial and service organizations. During their attendance in a leadership seminar, the managers' attachment  was assessed using the Experiences in Close Relationship Inventory. They were  asked to report on their hood experiences using the  Style Index, and to answer questions regarding their leadership behavior, using a short version of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire. Findings Results indicated associations between al , attachment , and leadership. Specifically, al autonomy granting was negatively associated with both attachment anxiety and avoidance. Both transformational and transactional leadership  were positively associated with al autonomy, but only transformational leadership was  positively associated with al involvement. In addition, transactional leadership was positively associated with attachment avoidance in close relationships. Research limitations/implications Testing the contributions of perceived al  in hood and attachment  in adulthood to the manager's manifested leadership  helps to advance our theoretical understanding of important leadership antecedents. The findings may  help practitioners in developing leadership skills and assisting managers in finding ways to moderate their natural tendencies and better depend on, delegate, and empower subordinates. Originality/value This empirical  provides evidence of the important role of perceived al  in the development of adult attachment and leadership . The effects found in the   extend the existing findings by showing that not only the attachment  but  al  play a significant role in shaping the individual's leadership behaviors."
Resilience among african american adolescent mothers: Predictors of positive parenting in early infancy,2002,"Objective: To use Nath et al.'s (1991) conceptual model of adolescent  to examine the relationship between resiliency factors measured shortly after delivery and maternal  behavior at 6 months. Method: We recruited 181 first-time, adolescent African American mothers at delivery. Data on resiliency factors (maturity, self-esteem, and mother-grandmother relationships) were collected when infants were 1-4 weeks of age. Data on al nurturance and  satisfaction were examined through observations and self-report at 6 months. Results: Multiple regression analyses were used to examine the longitudinal impact of resiliency factors on al nurturance and  satisfaction. Maternal maturity, positive self-esteem, and positive adolescent mother-grandmother relationships (characterized by autonomy and mutuality) were associated with better  outcomes. Maternal  satisfaction was lowest when infants were temperamentally difficult and mothers and grandmothers had a confrontational relationship. Conclusions: Longitudinal associations between mother-grandmother relationships at delivery and al behavior and satisfaction 6 months later may suggest an intergenerational transmission of  . Recommendations are provided for intervention programs to enhance mother-grandmother relationships in contexts where adolescents are required to live with a guardian to receive government assistance."
My Parents Never Spent Time With Me! Migrants' Parents in Italy and Hegemonic Ideals of Competent Parenting,2015,"Mothers who migrated from Morocco and Ecuador to northeast Italy are the subject for this article, which explores the way in which they observe Italian  and tend to negatively evaluate the care they received at home. They consider their settlement in Italy as an opportunity to acquire a modern  of . They  access websites and books to seek advice on how to , mixing home-country and settlement-country sources of information. They do not perceive any contradiction between these different sources of information, which are considered science, and therefore as culture free. The article shows how  advice is more than just scientific or cultural: It is imbued with hegemonic political discourses. The appropriation of the hegemonic  discourses is, indeed, far from deterministic, being riddled with resistances and ambiguities. Through the dynamic entanglements of normative constraints and new resources offered by multiple  models, mothers contribute to the renegotiation of the terms of local, transnational, and global citizenship."
Improving  and parenting outcomes following paediatric acquired brain injury: a randomised controlled trial of Stepping Stones Triple P plus Acceptance and Commitment Therapy,2014,"Background: Persistent behavioural difficulties are common following paediatric acquired brain injury (ABI). s and families  experience heightened stress, psychological symptoms and burden, and there is evidence of a reciprocal relationship between  and  functioning, which may be mediated by the adoption of maladaptive  practices. Despite this, there is currently a paucity of  in family interventions in this population. The aim of this  was to determine the efficacy of Stepping Stones Triple P: Positive  Program (SSTP), with an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) workshop, in improving  outcomes and  practices following paediatric ABI. Methods: Fifty-nine s of  (mean age 7 years, SD 3 years, 1 month; 35 males, 24 females) with ABI (Traumatic injuries 58%, Tumour 17%, Encephalitis or meningitis 15%, Cardiovascular accident 7%, Hypoxia 3%) who were evidencing at least mild behaviour problems were randomly assigned to treatment or care-as-usual conditions over 10 weeks. Mixed-model repeated-measures linear regression analyses were conducted to compare conditions from pre- to postintervention on  behavioural and emotional functioning (Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) and dysfunctional   ( Scale). Assessment of maintenance of change was conducted at a 6-month follow-up. The trial was registered on Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ID: ACTRN12610001051033, www.anzctr.org.au). Results: Significant time-by-condition interactions were identified on number and intensity of  behaviour problems,  emotional symptoms and  laxness and overreactivity, indicating significant improvements in the treatment condition, with medium-to-large effect sizes. Most improvements were maintained at 6 months. Conclusions: Group  interventions incorporating Triple P and ACT may be efficacious in improving  and  outcomes following paediatric ABI."
Parental and Child Characteristics Predicting Asian immigrants' Feeding Practices,2021,"To explore  ,  effortful control,  stress, and their associations with maternal use of pressure to eat among Asian U.S. immigrant families with preschoolers. One hundred and nine Asian immigrant mothers with 3-to-5-year-old  in Maryland, United States rated their authoritative and authoritarian  , frequency of pressuring their  to eat, perceived  stress, and 's effortful control. Two proposed moderated mediation models were tested using conditional process modeling. Effortful control mediated the association between authoritative   and pressure to eat practices, alpha beta = -0.07, p < 0.05, and the association between authoritarian  and pressure to eat, alpha beta = 0.12, p < 0.05. Moreover,  stress moderated the association between  effortful control and maternal pressure to eat in the authoritarian  model, but not in the authoritative  model. Specifically, higher effortful control was associated with less use of pressure to eat at low and mean levels of  stress. Our findings revealed potential mechanisms underlying the associations between   and controlling feeding practices. Importantly, information learned from the   may guide transdisciplinary efforts to design and implement culturally sensitive and family-based interventions targeting Asian immigrants' wellbeing and obesity in the United States."
"Linking Peoples' Pursuit of Eudaimonia and Hedonia with Characteristics of their Parents: Parenting Styles, Verbally Endorsed Values, and Role Modeling",2012,"Research on eudaimonia (seeking to use and develop the best in oneself) and hedonia (seeking pleasure, enjoyment, comfort), two dominant ways of pursuing the good life, has previously focused on their well-being consequences and correlates. Little is known about their predictors. Two retrospective studies with undergraduates began investigating the links between the behavior of one's s when one was a , and the degree to which one pursues eudaimonia and/or hedonia and derives well-being from these pursuits. Study 1 (n = 105) showed that participants engaged in eudaimonic pursuits if their s had been high on responsiveness and/or demandingness, the two dimensions that define positive . Hedonic pursuits did not relate to either  dimension. Study 2 (n = 110) showed that people engaged in eudaimonic pursuits if their s had either verbally endorsed eudaimonia or actually role modeled it by pursuing eudaimonia themselves. However, people derived well-being from eudaimonic pursuits only if their s had role modeled eudaimonia, not if their s had merely verbally endorsed it. The same pattern was found for engaging in hedonic pursuits and deriving well-being from them. It was  found that s who role modeled eudaimonia had  who grew up to derive well-being not only from eudaimonia but  from hedonia. s who role modeled hedonia had  who grew up to derive well-being only from hedonia and not from eudaimonia."
Late adolescent perceptions of parent religiosity and parenting processes,2004,"The current investigation examined the relations between adolescent reports of  religiosity and  processes, using both a dimensional and a typological conceptualization of . Self-report data were collected from 357 late adolescents. Partial correlations indicated that  religiosity was associated with both  dimensions and   in conceptually expected directions. Regression analyses provided evidence that the dimensional conceptualization of  explained additional variability in perceived al religiosity above and beyond   effects. Findings suggest that a dimensional conceptualization of  processes extends the literature on  religiosity because it yields more nuanced information about how al religiosity may be related to differentiated  behaviors. Potential therapeutic implications of the findings are discussed."
Self-Reported and Observed Punitive Parenting Prospectively Predicts Increased Error-Related Brain Activity in Six-Year-Old Children,2015,"The error-related negativity (ERN) is a negative deflection in the event-related potential (ERP) occurring approximately 50 ms after error commission at fronto-central electrode sites and is thought to reflect the activation of a generic error monitoring system. Several studies have reported an increased ERN in clinically anxious , and suggest that anxious  are more sensitive to error commission-although the mechanisms underlying this association are not clear. We have previously found that punishing errors  in a larger ERN, an effect that persists after punishment ends. It is possible that learning-related experiences that impact sensitivity to errors may lead to an increased ERN. In particular, punitive  might sensitize  to errors and increase their ERN. We tested this possibility in the current  by prospectively examining the relationship between   during early hood and 's ERN approximately 3 years later. Initially, 295 s and  (approximately 3 years old) participated in a structured observational measure of  behavior, and s completed a self-report measure of  . At a follow-up assessment approximately 3 years later, the ERN was elicited during a Go/No-Go task, and diagnostic interviews were completed with s to assess  psychopathology. Results suggested that both observational measures of hostile  and self-report measures of authoritarian   uniquely predicted a larger ERN in  3 years later. We previously reported that  in this sample with anxiety disorders were characterized by an increased ERN. A mediation analysis indicated that ERN magnitude mediated the relationship between harsh  and  anxiety disorder. Results suggest that  may shape 's error processing through environmental conditioning and thereby risk for anxiety, although future work is needed to confirm this hypothesis."
Measuring adolescents' tourism satisfaction: The role of mood and perceived parental style,2019,"Adolescents have become an attractive market for tourism because they re a sizeable population segment with an increasing influence on family purchases. There is an urgent need to understand adolescents' needs, motivations, and role in the tourism industry, particularly the factors that may affect their tourism satisfaction. This  highlights the importance of adolescents' mood and the  in which they have been ed as under-ed factors affecting young people's tourism satisfaction. The focus of the  is Ali Sadr cave, a well-known tourist destination for families in Iran. In 2016, questionnaires were distributed to 360 tourists ranging in age from 11 to 18 years. Descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation analysis, and multiple regressions were run on the 354 useable responses. Results showed, firstly, that 60.2% of the respondents had high levels of satisfaction with mean scores above 3.5 for all items. Secondly, the dominant  , as perceived by the adolescents, was authoritative. Finally, there was a significant and positive relationship between authoritative   and positive mood in relation to adolescents' basic needs satisfaction. Authoritarian   and negative mood had a significant and negative relationship with the satisfaction of all three basic needs, namely autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Permissiveness had a positive relationship with only two of the needs - autonomy and relatedness."

Relationship among the Parenting Styles and the Social Competence and Prosocial Behaviors of the Children Who are Attending to State and Private Preschools,2012,"The purpose of the   was to investigate the associations of social competence and prosocial behaviors of the boys and girls who are attending to private or state preschools with the   of mothers' perception. Participants of the  were 344 's (ranging from 35 and 75 months of age) teachers and mothers. These  were attending to preschools located in Ankara. In this   Styles and Dimension Scales and Prosocial Behavior Scale were applied to the mothers, Teacher Rating Scales for Social Competence and Prosocial Behavior Scale were applied to the teachers. Findings revealed that the girls have positive interactions with their peers and teachers more than the boys do and the boys have negative interactions with their peers more than the girls do. Furthermore, the scores of negative interactions with peers of the  who have authoritative s were higher than those of the  who have permissive s. In addition, the scores of negative interactions with peers and noninteraction behaviors of the  attending to a private preschool were higher than that of the  attending to a state preschool. Moreover, in terms of both mother and teacher ratings of prosocial behaviors, girls tend to show more prosocial behaviors than boys.

Structured Curriculum to Improve Pediatric Resident Confidence and Skills in Providing Parenting Advice,2019,"Context: Residents receive little  education despite its potential to improve  behavior and decrease  maltreatment despite the inclusion of  content on board certification examinations. Teaching residents how to discuss  and foster positive - relationships is essential to treating the whole person in osteopathic pediatric medicine. Objective: To improve pediatric and internal medicine-pediatric residents' knowledge. confidence, and skills in providing  advice. Methods: Four toddler  and discipline modules were developed. During continuity clinic, residents viewed and discussed modules with faculty. Residents completed a confidence and knowledge questionnaire before and after the curriculum, provided a self-report of use of skills learned, and completed a feasibility survey. Faculty  completed a feasibility survey. Results: Forty-one of 61 residents (67%) participated in the . Before participation, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) resident score for confidence in giving advice was 6.0 (4.0-7.0) (on a 10-point scale), increasing to 7.0 (6.0-8.0) for those completing 1 to 3 modules and 8.0 (8.0-9.0) for those completing 4 modules. Median (IQR) score on board- questions was 8.0 (7.0-9.0) (on a 12-point scale) before participating in the modules and 8.5 (7.5-9.5) for those completing 1 to 3 modules and 9.0 (7.0-9.0) for those completing 4 modules after participation; the increase was not statistically significant. Nine faculty and 29 residents completed the modules and responded to the exit survey regarding feasibility and acceptability of the curriculum. On a 4-point scale (4 being excellent), sessions had an overall mean (SD) rating of 3.7 (0.5) by faculty and 3.5 (0.5) by residents. Most residents (27 [93.1%]) reported interest in more modules, and 28 residents (96.6%) reported using information learned from the modules during clinic visits. Conclusion: Confidence delivering  advice increased among residents who completed the curriculum modules. Faculty and residents reported high feasibility ratings, and residents endorsed application of skills during clinic visits and interest in more modules."

Parenting Styles and Adolescents' School Adjustment: Investigating the Mediating Role of Achievement Goals within the 2 x 2 Framework,2017,"This  examines the multiple mediating roles of achievement goals based on a 2 x 2 framework of the relationships between   and adolescents' school adjustment. The  sample included 1061 Chinese adolescent students (50.4% girls) between the ages of 12 and 19, who completed questionnaires regarding   (al autonomy support and psychological control), achievement goals (mastery approach, mastery avoidance, performance approach, and performance avoidance goals) and school adjustment variables (emotion, students' life satisfaction, school self-esteem, problem behavior, academic achievement, and self-determination in school). A structural equation modeling (SEM) approach was used to test our hypotheses. The  indicated that al autonomy support was associated with adolescents' school adjustment in an adaptive manner, both directly and through its positive relationship with both mastery and performance approach goals; however, al psychological control was associated with adolescents' school adjustment in a maladaptive manner, both directly and through its positive relationship with both mastery and performance avoidance goals. In addition, the  indicated that mastery avoidance goals suppressed the relationship between al autonomy support and adolescents' school adjustment, and performance approach goals suppressed the relationship between this adjustment and al psychological control. These findings extend the limited literature regarding the 2 x 2 framework of achievement goals and enable us to evidence the mediating and suppressing effects of achievement goals. This  highlights the importance of  in adolescents' school adjustment through the cultivation of different achievement goals."

Setting: Focus groups (n = 65) were conducted in 3 states (Florida, New Jersey, and West Virginia). Participants: School-age  (n = 194) between the ages of 6 and 11 years old. Phenomenon of Interest: What  practices are recommended by , and are they in line with best-practice guidelines? Analysis: Focus group data were analyzed to identify themes and trends. Results: Children's recommendations were congruent with authoritative   (ie, high levels of warmth and control). Most of the advice shared by  aligned with recommended  practices (ie, responsive feeding, facilitation, environmental restructuring,  modeling, and encouragement). However, not all of the 's advice aligned with best practices guidelines (ie, use of food rewards and deception). Conclusions And Implications: Future nutrition education programs may be strengthened by helping s adopt best practices for promoting healthy  behaviors. Furthermore, teaching  about recommended  feeding  practices may help protect future generations by preparing  to care for younger siblings or raise their  using best  practices."
Improving parenting practices and development for young  in Rwanda: Results from a randomized control trial,2020,"It is well known that the first 1,000 days of life have long-lasting impact on a 's cognitive, language, socio-emotional, and physical development, but there is little evidence from Rwanda about how to maximize - interactions during these critical early years. Save the Children piloted the First Steps Intera za Mbere early hood  education program in one district of Rwanda to promote healthy development through holistic  education. Using a cluster randomized control trial, we assessed outcomes of a 17-week  education on  skills and  development for families with  aged 6-36 months. Families were randomly allocated into three  groups: light touch (n = 482), full intervention (n = 482), and control (n = 483) groups. We used a Kinyarwanda-adaptation of the validated Ages & Stages Questionnaires (ASQ), a Home Observation Measurement of the Environment-Short Form. Multivariate linear and logistic regression analyses were used for both the intention-to-treat analyses and more robust models controlling for ASQ form received,  gender, maternal education, number of  in the home, and baseline ASQ scores. Findings indicate that  in the light touch and full intervention groups were significantly more likely to meet the ASQ benchmarks than the control group in all developmental domains. The strong positive  from the light touch group are especially relevant to efforts to bring beneficial early hood stimulation programs to scale in low-income contexts."
The Bio-Culture of Parenting: Evidence From Five Cultural Communities,2004,"Objective. This  analyzes culturally formed   during infancy, as related to the sociocultural orientations of independence and interdependence. Design. Free-play situations between mothers and 3-month-old infants were videotaped in 5 cultural communities that differ according to their sociocultural orientations: cultural communities in West Africa (N = 26), Gujarat in India (N = 39), Costa Rica (N = 21), Greece (N = 51), and Germany (N = 56).

Distress Tolerance in Mothers of Children with Cancer for Predicting Her Parenting Style and Child's Attachment Behaviors: A Cross Sectional Study,2020,"Background: Childhood cancer leads to emotional disruption and distress in mothers. Objectives: The aim of this  was to determine how much maternal distress tolerance could predict   and the 's attachment behaviors. Methods: In this cross-sectional , which was carried out in May and June 2018 in Mahak Hospital (a specialized pediatric oncology hospital), based on Morgan tables, 130 mothers of  with cancer (leukemia or brain tumor) participated. The available sampling method was used. Simultaneous multiple regression analysis by SPSS 24 was applied for data analysis. Results: The  of this  showed that the level of low distress tolerance predicted authoritarian   (P < 0.05) and high tolerance predicted logistic authority(P < 0.001), while the permissive  was not predicted with maternal disturbances. On the other hand, high tolerance foresawpositive adaptive evolution and low tolerance projected emotional response and negative behaviors of the  with cancer (P < 0.001), but could not predict avoidance behavior. Conclusions: Mothers with more ability for disruption tolerance tended to use the authoritative   and mothers, who were more disrupted, were more likely to use authoritarian . Mothers with less disturbance in the development of positive adaptive evolution and management of emotional reactions and negative behaviors in the patient's  were more effective (or at least had a more positive perception of their 's excitement and behavior), but maternal disturbances had a disturbing behavior in  with cancer. The education of distress management is recommended for mothers with a  with cancer."
Disrupting Intergenerational Continuity in Harsh and Abusive Parenting: The Importance of a Nurturing Relationship With a Romantic Partner,2013,"Purpose: Harsh, abusive, and rejecting behavior by s toward their  is associated with increased risk for many developmental problems for youth. Earlier   shows that  raised by harsh s are more likely to treat their own  harshly. The   evaluated nurturing and supportive behaviors of spouses or cohabiting romantic partners hypothesized to strengthen co- relationships and help break this intergenerational cycle of harsh . Methods: Data come from the Family Transitions Project, a 22-year, 3-generation  of a cohort of over 500 early adolescents (G2) grown to adulthood. During adolescence, observers rated G1 ( of G2) harsh  to G2. Several years later, observers rated G2 harsh  toward their oldest  (G3). In addition, G2's romantic partner (spouse or cohabiting partner) was rated by observers on a range of behaviors expected to affect G2 harsh . Results: Romantic partner warmth and positive communication with G2 were associated with less G2 harsh  toward G3 (a compensatory or main effect) and when these partner behaviors were high, there was no evidence of intergenerational continuity from G1 to G2 harsh  (a moderating or protective effect). G1 harsh  slightly decreased the likelihood that G2 would select a supportive spouse or romantic partner (evidence of cumulative continuity). Conclusions: Romantic partner warmth and positive communication appear to disrupt continuity in harsh and abusive . As appropriate, preventive interventions designed to reduce risk for  maltreatment should include a focus on spousal or partner behaviors in their educational or treatment programs.

Predicting use of ineffective vegetable parenting practices with the Model of Goal Directed Behavior,2015,"Objective: Increasing a 's ability to influence a 's vegetable intake may require reducing the 's use of ineffective vegetable  practices. The   was designed to understand the psychosocial influences on ineffective vegetable  practices. Design: A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted to model use of ineffective vegetable  practices using validated scales from a Model of Goal Directed Vegetable  Practices. Setting: The dependent variable was a composite ineffective vegetable  practices index. The independent variables included validated subscales of intention, habit, perceived barriers, desire, competence, autonomy, relatedness, attitudes, norms, perceived behavioural control and anticipated emotions. Models were analysed using block regression with backward deletion. Subjects: s of 307 pre-school  (3-5 years old). Results: Variables significantly positively related to ineffective vegetable  practices in order of relationship strength included habit of controlling vegetable practices (standardized beta=0.349, P < 0.0001) and desire (standardized beta=0.117, P=0.025). Variables significantly negatively related to ineffective vegetable  practices in order of relationship strength included perceived behavioural control of negative  practices (standardized beta=-0.215, P < 0000), the habit of active  involvement in vegetable selection (standardized beta=-0.142, P=0.008), anticipated negative  emotional response to  vegetable refusal (standardized beta=-0.133, P=0.009), autonomy (standardized beta=-0.118, P=0.014), attitude about negative effects of vegetables (standardized beta=-0.118, P=0.015) and descriptive norms (standardized beta=-0.103, P=0.032). The model accounted for 40.5% of the variance in use of ineffective vegetable  practices. Conclusions: The   is the first report of psychometrically tested scales to predict use of ineffective vegetable  practices. Innovative intervention procedures will need to be designed and tested to reduce ineffective vegetable  practices."
The Nature and Nurture of Social Development: The Role of 5-HTTLPR and Gene-Parenting Interactions,2019,"Social skills are traditionally viewed as acquired through social environments including . However. biopsychosocial models highlight the importance of genetic influences and gene-environment interactions (GxEs) in  development. Extant GxE investigations often fail to account for developmental changes in the phenotype or rigorously assess the social environment using observational measures. The   prospectively assessed 110  (44.5% female) and their s to explore biologically plausible independent and interactive associations of the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) and observed positive and negative  in prediction of (a) initial levels of social skills at school entry (age 6 years) and (b) developmental changes in social skills across the early school years (ages 6-9 years). Overall, the SS (vs. SL/LL) 5-HTTLPR genotype inversely predicted social skills across all domains, although  behavior moderated these associations wherein putative GxE effects differed by developmental timing and social skills domain. Positive  positively predicted concurrent (age 6) overall social skills for  with SL/LL genotypes, but not the SS genotype. However. for the SS group only, age 6 positive  positively predicted prospective growth in social responsibility, although negative  positively predicted growth in social cooperation. Findings suggest that 5-HTTLPR may signal differential sensitivities to   and patterns of social development, which may help to inform targeted intervention approaches to enhance person-environment fit."
When Fathers' Supportiveness Matters Most: Maternal and Paternal Parenting and Children's School Readiness,2010,"Data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N = 723) were used to test whether the effects of fathers' supportive  on 's school readiness are greater when mothers are least supportive. We distinguished between academic and social dimensions of school readiness. Mothers' and fathers'  was assessed in dyadic   videotaped sessions during the preschool period. Results for both academic and social outcomes indicated that fathers' supportiveness had larger benefits for  at lower levels of mothers' supportiveness. In fact, fathers' supportiveness was associated with 's school readiness only when mothers scored average or below on supportiveness. Mothers' supportiveness was similarly associated with 's social school readiness when fathers scored average or below on supportiveness. However, mothers' supportiveness was associated with 's academic school readiness even when fathers scored above average on supportiveness. The  suggest that fathers may influence  development most as potential buffers against unsupportive mother . Further  is needed to replicate these analyses in a less socioeconomically advantaged sample."
Parent-Adolescent Discrepancies in Perceived Parenting Characteristics and Adolescent Developmental Outcomes in Poor Chinese Families,2014,"We examined the relationships between -adolescent discrepancies in perceived  characteristics (indexed by al responsiveness, al demandingness, and al control) and adolescent developmental outcomes (indexed by achievement motivation and psychological competence) in poor families in Hong Kong. A sample of 275 intact families having at least one  aged 11-16 experiencing economic disadvantage were invited to participate in the . Fathers and mothers completed the  Style Scale and Chinese al Control Scale, and adolescents completed the Social-Oriented Achievement Motivation Scale and Chinese Positive Youth Development Scale in addition to paternal and maternal  Style Scale and Chinese al Control Scale. Results indicated that s and adolescents had different perceptions of al responsiveness, al demandingness, and paternal control, with adolescents generally perceived lower levels of  behaviors than did their s. While father-adolescent discrepancy in perceived paternal responsiveness and mother-adolescent discrepancy in perceived maternal control negatively predicted adolescent achievement motivation, mother-adolescent discrepancy in perceptions of maternal responsiveness negatively predicted psychological competence in adolescents experiencing economic disadvantage. The  findings provided support that - discrepancies in perceived  characteristics have negative impacts on the developmental outcomes of adolescents experiencing economic disadvantage. The   addresses - discrepancies in perceived al behaviors as legitimate constructs, and explores their links with adolescent psychosocial development, which sheds light for ers and clinical practitioners in helping the Chinese families experiencing economic disadvantage."
"Parenting, self-concept, and attitudes about romantic relationships",2020,"Introduction: This  examined associations among the perceived , self-concept, and adolescent attitudes of Chinese adolescents regarding romantic relationships. Methods: A survey of 729 high school students in Macau was carried out to collect information on the degree to which they perceived their fathers and mothers as demanding or responsive, their general self-concept, and their attitudes about romantic relationships. Results: Structural equation modeling showed that maternal and paternal responsiveness positively associated with adolescents' self-concept, which then positively contributed to their attitudes about romantic relationships. Maternal demandingness could link directly to positive adolescent attitudes about romantic relationships and indirectly to negative self-concept. Conclusions: The  's findings suggest that perceived maternal  may be more important than perceived paternal  regarding adolescents' romantic attitudes, and al responsiveness is particularly critical to positive self-concept and positive romantic attitudes in Chinese culture."
"Negative hood experiences, parental styles and resilience among people who report paranormal experiences",2021,"Child trauma can lead to the development of a personality fantasy prone and life, to develop paranormal beliefs and experiences as a strategy to cope with anxiety during adulthood. In other words, beliefs and paranormal experiences can be a system of reations that allow us to give sense and meaning to control trauma anxiety, and in general an illusion of control over future disturbing events. There are relatively few studies examining the al  and para normal experiences/beliefs, therefore, the aim of this  is to measure the dominant al  of those who have experienced paranormal events and their correlate with negative events in hood. The Survey of Paranormal Experiences, the Survey of Negative Experiences in Children, and the Scale of al Styles were administered to a sample of 644 individuals of both sexes 28 % males and 72 % females (Mean = 28.13 years) in a simple intentional non-probabilistic sampled technique. The  showed high frequency of experiences such as Sense of presence (58 %), Premonitory dreams (56 %), Telepathy (41 %), Mystical experiences (40 %), Apparitions (38 %), and Out-of-Body experiences (25 %). The  confirmed hypotheses which predict (H1) a positive and significant relationship will be found between negative experiences in hood and the frequency of paranormal experiences in adult life which was confirmed (r(s) = .27, p < .001); and (H2) individuals who reported a higher frequency of paranormal experiences showed a more Authoritarian   compared to a Negligent, Overprotective, Permissive and Authoritative  , which was confirmed for Mother chi(2) = 18.24, p < .001, but not for Father, who showed a more Permissive  chi(2) = 8.11, p < .001 compared to a negligent, overprotective, authoritarian and authoritative  . The  here support, in part, the idea that adult paranormality is an adaptive mechanism that helps individuals cope with an absence of control in hood. For example, when the s do not meet the physical, psychological, and/or emotional needs of the , who ends up being explicitly insulted, ridiculed, shouted at, emotionally manipulated, or unfairly blamed by s-One possible interpretation is that traumatic events in hood are not only the source for the emergence of other paranormal experiences but a permissive and negligent al  helps to reinforce the way in which these negative experiences are processed cognitive and emotionally. The al bond in hood and throughout life, can  function as a modulator of the occurrence of the paranormal experience. The al bond in hood and throughout life, can  function as a modulator of the occurrence of the paranormal experience. Consequently, the behavior of the s is an easily available model that  imitate involuntarily. The al bond in hood and throughout life can  function as a modulator of the occurrence of paranormal experiences and, to some extent, its cognitive adaptation. In this way, internalization can be a much more active process by which s strive to inculcate their own beliefs in their , which may involve an explicit program of instruction and positive encouragement but sometimes a degree of coercion and punishment for their breach as well. Therefore, through the process of internalization, the s' beliefs can be assimilated into the 's own frame of reference and their anomalous experiences. s showed a more permissive  , characterized by greater receptivity than demand, that is, s are more lenient and tended to give in to the demands of their  and give them support, this   significantly favored such paranormal experiences as sense of presence and seeing ghosts."
Oxytocin receptor polymorphism influences characterization of harm avoidance by moderating susceptibility to affectionless control parenting,2021,"Introduction Oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene polymorphism reportedly moderates effects of negative environments during hood on mental function and behavior such as depressive symptoms and externalizing problems. This  examined OXTR gene polymorphism effects on personality traits in healthy participants, considering interaction effects of polymorphism with affectionless control (AC)  which is one of the dysfunctional and pathogenic  . Methods For 496 Japanese volunteers, personality was evaluated using the Temperament and Character Inventory. The al Bonding Instrument, which has subscales of care and protection, was used to assess perceived al rearing. AC  was defined as low care and high protection. A/G polymorphism of the OXTR gene (rs53576) was detected using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay. Results Two-way analysis of covariance revealed significant interaction effects between the genotype and the number of AC s on scores of harm avoidance, with no significant main effect of genotype on any personality. Post-hoc analysis revealed that the harm avoidance scores were increased in a stepwise manner with respect to the increase of the number of AC s in the A allele carriers. No similar association was observed in the A allele noncarriers.

Therefore, the   aimed at comparing socialization goals and  practices among three groups of s to allow insights into cultural influences on  and socialization goals under the condition of immigration. The  groups were (a) an immigrant group of Mongolian s in Germany, (b) Mongolians in their native culture, and (c) German s. Results showed little differences between the three groups of s. However, it could be demonstrated that Mongolians in Germany rated socialization goals more similarly to Germans than Mongolians in their native culture, indicating a change under new cultural influences. Regarding , Germans used less corporal punishment and monitored the activities of  more closely than both Mongolian groups, while power assertion was used less by Mongolians in their native culture than Mongolians and Germans in Germany. The similarities and differences in socialization goals and  practices are discussed with regard to cultural influences."
Mindful Parenting Assessed Further: Psychometric Properties of the Dutch Version of the Interpersonal Mindfulness in Parenting Scale (IM-P),2014,"Psychometric properties of the Dutch version of the Interpersonal Mindfulness in  Scale (IM-P) were studied in a general population sample of mothers of adolescents (n=866) ( 1). A six-factor structure (29 items) emerged using exploratory factor analysis. A main difference from the original IM-P was that aspects of compassion and emotional awareness were separated into different factors for the self and the , instead of combined into one factor. In a second general population sample of mothers of adolescents (n=199), the six-factor structure was confirmed using confirmatory factor analysis ( 2). The proposed 29-item version of the IM-P and its subscales were shown to have good internal consistencies, apart from the sixth factor. As expected, a high correlation was found with general mindfulness questionnaires (FFMQ and FMI). Furthermore, the IM-P correlated positively as expected with quality of life and optimism and negatively with depression and dysfunctional  . These expected indications of construct validity were found in  2, as well as in mothers (n=112) of adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus ( 3) which was added to examine whether the Dutch version of the IM-P was  valid in a pediatric population. Overall, these three studies  good psychometric properties of the Dutch translation of the first measure of mindful ."
The moderating effects of parenting styles in the association between behavioral inhibition and parent-reported guilt and empathy in preschool ,2007,"This  investigated interactions between 's temperament and   in their association with measures of guilt and empathy. Participants were 87 predominantly Caucasian, middle-class mothers and their  between the ages of 3 and 5 (M = 4.39, SD =.51). Children nominated by their preschool teachers as being behaviorally inhibited showed higher levels of -rated guilt and empathy than uninhibited , irrespective of the type and quality of  they experienced. However, for uninhibited , greater inconsistent discipline was associated with lower levels of guilt and lower levels of empathy, whereas higher levels of authoritarian  were associated with higher levels of guilt. These  support the presence of important interactions between temperament and  in explaining two critical dimensions of callous-unemotional traits."
Dysfunctional Parenting Styles Are Associated with Mental Disorders and Low Self-Efficacy Beliefs in Brazilian Undergraduate Medical Students,2021,"Objective. To investigate the association between al bonding  and anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, and self-efficacy beliefs in undergraduate medical students. Methods. A cross-sectional, self-administered survey involving 315 Brazilian medical students was conducted online. The al Bonding Instrument (PBI), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R), and the general self-efficacy (GSE) scale were used. The internal consistency of the instruments used in the  was analyzed using Cronbach's alpha. Multiple logistic regression models were applied, and the odds ratios (OR) and respective 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to determine the association between al bonding  and anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, and general self-efficacy beliefs. Results. In the analysis adjusted for sociodemographic variables, maternal affectionless control was associated with a greater risk of anxiety (OR=2.48; 95% CI: 1.15-5.33), depression (OR=7.54; 95% CI: 3.20-17.78), suicidal ideation (OR=3.62; 95% CI: 1.58-8.27), and low self-efficacy (OR=3.81; 95% CI: 1.76-8.25), while maternal neglectful  was associated with depression (OR=3.24; 95% CI: 1.17-8.96) and paternal affectionate constraint with suicidal ideation (OR=3.09; 95% CI: 1.36-7.02). Conclusions. These findings showed dysfunctional   to be associated with mental illnesses and low self-efficacy in Brazilian undergraduate medical students. This should be taken into consideration when treating medical students with mental disorders."
GOODNESS OF FIT BETWEEN PARENTING STYLE AND CHILD TEMPERAMENT: SPECIAL CHALLENGES WITH SLOW-TO-WARM-UP INFANTS,2009,"This review focuses on the goodness-of-fit concept, concentrating specifically on how a poor fit between the temperament behaviors of infants and young  and s' expectations and  skills can stress and challenge the - relationship and potentially lead to poor  outcomes. We consider the role of the , the , and the context in establishing, maintaining, and modifying the goodness of fit between 's temperament and their s' behaviors and in determining  outcomes. We conclude by ing findings from a recent analysis of 629 mothers and their  that illustrates the special challenges of  slow-to-warm-up infants using the goodness-of-fit perspective."
The Association of Mindful Parenting with Glycemic Control and Quality of Life in Adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes: Results from Diabetes MILES-The Netherlands,2016,"The objective of this  was to examine associations between the mindful   of s of adolescents (aged 12-18) with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and the glycaemic control and quality of life (QoL) of the adolescents. Chronic health conditions, such as T1DM, that require demanding treatment regimens, can negatively impact adolescents' quality of life. Therefore, it is important to determine whether mindful  may have a positive impact in these adolescents. Age, sex and duration of T1DM were examined as potential moderators. s (N = 215) reported on their own mindful   (IM-P-NL) and the adolescents' glycaemic control. s and the adolescents with T1DM (N = 129) both reported on adolescents' generic and diabetes-specific QoL (PedsQL (TM)). The  showed that a more mindful   was associated with more optimal hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) values for boys. For girls, a more mindful   was associated with not having been hospitalized for ketoacidosis. For both boys and girls, a more mindful   was associated with better generic and diabetes-specific proxy-reported QoL. In conclusion, mindful   may be a factor in helping adolescents manage their T1DM. Mindful  intervention studies for s of adolescents with T1DM are needed to examine the effects on adolescents' glycaemic control and their quality of life."
The association between parenting and the error-related negativity across hood and adolescence,2020,"Anxiety is the most common form of psychopathology, and it is often characterized by chronic impairment across the lifespan. Researchers have identified core neural markers that confer risk for anxious outcomes. An increased error-related negativity (ERN) in anxious individuals has been shown to prospectively predict onset of anxiety disorders across development. Hence, it is critical to examine environmental factors that may shape the ERN. In the current , we use a large sample of 170 female adolescents aged 10-17 to investigate whether the ERN mediates the relationship between   and anxiety diagnostic status. This  replicates previous findings, and it extends previous work by suggesting that this relationship is more robust in young  as compared to adolescents. Interventions targeting the ERN via  may be most effective during hood."
"Culture, parenting, and  behavioral problems: A comparative study of cross-cultural immigrant families and native-born families in Taiwan",2014,"Little is known about the interplay of cultural, , and sociodemographic/socioeconomic factors on 's behavioral problems, especially within culturally mixed families in Chinese society. This  compares the presence of behavioral problems between  from families with an immigrant mother and those from native-born families in a randomly selected sample of 957  aged 6 to 12 years from three counties in central Taiwan. Behavioral problems were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist completed by s and the Teacher's Report Form.   were assessed using the al Bonding Instrument completed by . Children of immigrant mothers had higher scores for all behavioral syndromes based on the 's report. However, in the teacher's report a difference was only observed for withdrawn/depressed syndrome. Children of immigrant mothers were more likely, and  with high paternal care were less likely, to have internalizing and total problems in the 's report. For the teacher's report, only high education in fathers was associated with decreased internalizing and total problems in . These findings suggest that  growing up in a cross-cultural environment with an immigrant mother, as opposed to a native-born Taiwanese family environment, are more likely to have higher internalizing problems and total behavioral problem scores, due to a number of cultural, , and sociodemographic factors. Children's behaviors appear to be more influenced by fathers' than mothers'  , regardless of family type. The  findings imply that unequal health and social conditions exist between cross-cultural and native-born families."
The association of personality characteristics with parenting problems among alcoholic couples,1998,"This retrospective cross-sectional  explored the associations of personality characteristics with  problems among 25 couples, one or both members of which were identified as alcoholics by virtue of their voluntary past completion of a residential program for alcoholics. Most of them (90%) scored lower, indicating their more problematic al attitudes and behaviors, on all four scales of the Adult-Adolescent  Inventory (AAPI: inappropriate al expectations of , lack empathy for 's needs, value physical punishment, and - role reversal) than average normal nonalcoholic, nonabusive adults. Such  problems were found to be very highly associated with clients' personality characteristics. For example, schizoid, schizotypal, histrionic, and passive aggressive characteristics (DSM-III-R-based) along with a few other personal characteristics of the couples, accounted for nearly all (90.2%, R-2 = .902) of their propensity to reverse roles with their . Findings  suggested that the identified  problems among alcoholic couples are amenable to programmatic intervention: the longer couples had participated in aftercare programs offered by the treatment facility the more appropriate and empathetic was their ."
Evaluation of the national roll-out of parenting programmes across England: the parenting early intervention programme (PEIP),2013,"Background: Evidence based  programmes can improve  skills and the behaviour of  exhibiting, or at risk of developing, antisocial behaviour. In order to develop a public policy for delivering these programmes it is necessary not only to demonstrate their efficacy through rigorous trials but  to determine that they can be rolled out on a large scale. The aim of the   was to evaluate the UK government funded national implementation of its  Early Intervention Programme, a national roll-out of  programmes for s of  8-13 years in all 152 local authorities (LAs) across England. Building upon our  of the Pathfinder (2006 08) implemented in 18 LAs. To the best of our knowledge this is the first comparative  of a national roll-out of  programmes and the first  of s of  8-13 years. Methods: The UK government funded English LAs to implement one or more of five evidence based programmes (later increased to eight): Triple P, Incredible Years, Strengthening Families Strengthening Communities, Families and Schools Together (FAST), and the Strengthening Families Programme (10-14). s completed measures of   (laxness and over-reactivity), and mental well-being, and   behaviour at three time points: pre- and post-course and again one year later. Results: 6143 s from 43 LAs were included in the  of whom 3325 provided post-test data and 1035 s provided data at one-year follow up. There were significant improvements for each programme, with effect sizes (Cohen's d) for the combined sample of 0.72  laxness, 0.85  over-reactivity, 0.79  mental well-being, and 0.45 for  conduct problems. These improvements were largely maintained one year later. All four programmes for which we had sufficient data for comparison were effective. There were generally larger effects on both  and  measures for Triple P, but not all between programme comparisons were significant. Results for the targeted group of s of  8-13 years were very similar. Conclusions: Evidence-based  programmes can be rolled out effectively in community settings on a national scale. This   demonstrates the impact of  on shaping government policy."
A Parenting Competency Model,2014,"SYNOPSIS Decades of  show a significant link between  quality and outcomes in . Whereas many professional caregiving groups are developing competency models for training and evaluation purposes, formation of a  competency model has been hindered by a lack of universally accepted standards for and the complexity of al functioning. This article advances a consensus on the dimensions of effective rearing and assembles a model of  competency based on empirically supported beneficial  practices and attributes from multiple psychological and health disciplines. Formed using existing professional competency development guidelines, and based on an interactive, cross-disciplinary, contextual conceptualization of competent , the proposed model consists of three foundational and five functional core competencies of  along with subcompetencies which operationalize them. Recognizing that different levels of competency exist, preliminary benchmarks for adequate and preferred function within competency areas are  offered along with behavioral anchor examples. The model's design allows for integration of cultural and contextual variables that impact  outcomes. The proposed multi-level, cross-disciplinary, contextual model may begin a discussion of what comprehensive competent  comprises. The proposed model's integrated structure may  serve as a framework for continued refinement of elements of competent , and how they interact and are affected by context and culture, as well as facilitating targeted and comprehensive preventive and therapeutic interventions."
Differences in Febrile and Respiratory Illnesses in Minority Children: The Sociodemographic Context of Restrictive Parenting,2019,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the moderating role of restrictive  on the relation of socioeconomic status (SES) to febrile illnesses (FIs) and upper respiratory illnesses (URIs) among ethnic minority and non-minority . METHODS: Children from diverse ethnic backgrounds (Caucasian, African American, Asian, Latino, other, or multiethnic) were followed across the course of the kindergarten year. s reported on SES and . A nurse completed 13 physical exams per  over the year to assess FIs and URIs. RESULTS: During the school year, 28% of  (n = 199, 56% ethnic minority) exhibited one or more FIs (range, 0-6) and 90% exhibited one or more URIs (range, 0-10). No main or moderating effects of SES or restrictive  on FIs or URIs were found among Caucasian ; however, among ethnic minority , the relation of SES to FIs was conditional upon restrictive  (3=.66; P=.02), as the fewest FIs were found for lower SES minority  whose s reported more restrictive practices. Additionally, among minority , more restrictive  was marginally associated with fewer URIs (3=.21; P=.05). CONCLUSIONS: Unexpectedly, among minority  the fewest illnesses occurred among lower SES  whose s endorsed more restrictive . This may be due to unique appraisals of this rearing  among minority  in lower SES environments and its potential to influence immune functioning. Results suggest variability in the effects of  on offspring health and support context-specific evaluations of  in efforts to ameliorate early health disparities."
Can mothers influence their 's eating behavior?,1999,"This  examined the relationship between general maternal  , maternal eating cues, and a 's eating behavior during mealtime. We expected that the general  would relate to the number of specific eating cues and that mothers who used more eating prompts would have  that ate more and at a faster rate. Seventy-seven  (39 girls, 38 boys), aged 3.5 years, visited the laboratory with their mothers for a videotaped lunch. Videotapes of each laboratory visit were coded for the 's eating rate and maternal  , which was measured as the level of maternal control and support and the number and type of eating prompts given during a meal. Caloric intake was  calculated. The number and rate of verbal and physical encouragements and discouragements were significantly related to measures of general maternal   and meal duration. The rates of food offers, food ations, and total prompts were all significantly related to the 's rate of calorie intake. However, a mother's level of support or control was not related to the 's eating behavior. Although general maternal   did not predict the 's eating behavior, these behaviors were related to the frequency of maternal eating prompts, which in turn were significantly related to the number of calories eaten and the time spent eating by the . Children who ate the fastest had mothers who delivered eating prompts at a higher frequency. These findings may have implications for the development of obesity later in hood, as a function of rapid eating or of poor self-regulation."
Changing Parental Style for the Management of Childhood Obesity: A Multi-Component Group Experience,2015,"Obesity is a complex public health issue with increasing prevalence in hood and with a large burden on physical and mental health. Recent data suggest the effectiveness of multi-component approach, of interventions aimed at changing  , and of group educational sessions. In particular, interventions containing a family-behavioral component produce larger effect sizes than alternative treatment groups. Many models have been developed for the multi-component and multi-stakeholder treatment of hood obesity, with a frequent discrepancy in the intensity of the treatment programme and in the resources available within clinics. Looking for effective strategies for the treatment of hood obesity we built a Multi-component Obesity Group Experience (MOGE) model, analysing BMI and fat mass reduction as primary outcomes and qualitative improvements in the behavior towards nutrition and life as secondary one. Thirty-five consecutive obese  (20 girls, BMI z-score 2.1 +/- 0.2), were treated by MOGE model and the  were compared with 35 matched obese subjects of the same age (control group followed with a traditional treatment). After 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment it has been observed a significant reduction of BMI z-score and body fat mass. Moreover, a clinically significant psychological wellness was observed in  of MOGE group."
The Role of Parenting in Affecting the Behavior and Adaptive Functioning of Young Children of HIV-Infected Mothers in South Africa,2014,"Prior investigations suggest that maternal HIV/AIDS poses significant challenges to young . This  investigates the relationships between mothers' psychological functioning, , and 's behavioral outcomes and functioning in a population of women living with HIV (N = 361) with a  between the ages of 6 and 10 years in Tshwane, South Africa. Utilizing path analysis, findings revealed that maternal depression is related to increased  stress and - dysfunction, maternal coping is related to  , and maternal coping,   and stress, and - dysfunction are associated with 's behavior and functioning, with  emerging as an important mediator. These findings suggest that interventions for women living with HIV and their  should not only address maternal psychological functioning (depression and coping), but should  focus on , promoting a positive approach."
A cross-sectional study on intergenerational parenting and attachment patterns in adult  of parents with mental illness,2019,"The   adds to the existing knowledge about adult  of s with mental illness. The aim was to explore differences between adult  of s with mental illness and s in the general population on a range of adult relationship and  variables. Utilizing a cross-sectional design, 86 adults across Australia participated in this  (47 general population; 39 adult  of s with mental illness). Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and parametric tests. Adult  of s with mental illness were found to be more permissive in their  compared with s in the general population. However, between-group differences were not found on measures of  competence, adult attachment, and relationship satisfaction. These findings suggest that adult  of s with mental illness are able to thrive just as well as individuals in the general population but may require some support in the form of al skills training. The paper concludes by highlighting the role of mental health professionals in the empowerment and resilience building of adult  of s with mental illness."
Impact of Maternal Betrayal Trauma on Parent and Child Well-Being: Attachment Style and Emotion Regulation as Moderators,2020,"Objective: While high betrayal (HB) traumas (i.e., traumas perpetrated by close others) are associated with reduced maternal and  well-being compared to low betrayal (LB) traumas (i.e., traumas that are noninterpersonal or perpetrated by nonclose others), moderators of these relationships have not yet been examined. The aim of the   was to examine the associations between maternal lifetime betrayal trauma and  and  well-being while  examining attachment  and emotion regulation as potential moderators. Method: Australian mothers (N = 174) of school-age  (5-12 years) completed online self-report measures assessing betrayal trauma, well-being, attachment , and emotion regulation strategies. Results: HB traumas were significantly associated with greater maternal distress and trauma symptoms. reduced  well-being, greater attachment anxiety. and greater difficulties with emotion regulation but were not significantly different with regard to  stress. social support satisfaction, or attachment avoidance when compared with LB traumas. Emotion regulation difficulties moderated the relationship between betrayal trauma history and maternal distress. Conclusions: These  indicate that mothers with HB trauma histories who  have difficulties with emotion regulation may experience greater levels of distress compared to mothers with HB trauma histories who use more adaptive emotion regulation strategies. Accordingly, it may be especially important for victims of HB traumas to address trauma-related misappraisals regarding the self and others while strengthening the use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies."
"The influence of self-concept, parenting style and individualism-collectivism on career maturity in Australia and Thailand",2011,"Relationships between career maturity and self-concept,   and individualism-collectivism across Australian and Thai cultural contexts were investigated. Berry's (1969) etic-emic model for adapting instruments for cross-cultural  was applied. Derived etic status was achieved for the career planning scale, five self-concept sub-scales and the al Bonding Instrument. Mean score comparisons revealed few significant differences between Australia and Thailand. None of the independent variables were associated with Thai career planning. Academic and social self-concept scales and father care were related to career planning in Australia. Implications are discussed."
Asian Guan Parenting and Life Satisfaction Among Adolescents in Malaysia: The Mediating Role of Filial Piety,2021,"Literature on adolescent development has shown that  practices have positive relationships with adolescents' life satisfaction. Adolescents' life satisfaction improves when they have s low in psychological control who uphold reciprocal self-disclosure in their communication. Guan  was found to correlate positively with adolescents' development. Therefore, it is methodologically important to replicate the investigation on the relationship between adolescents' life satisfaction and Guan . Literature suggests that filial piety is shaped by  practices and adolescents who perceived intense al concern, care, and involvement tend to uphold filial piety and express gratitude toward s which may promote the adolescents' life satisfaction. In this , mediation analysis was done to elucidate the relationship among s' guan  , filial piety, and life satisfaction on 606 adolescents (M-age=15.07; SDage=1.03; 52.1% females) in Malaysia. The adolescents were sampled through cluster sampling, and data were collected using self-administered questionnaires. The  showed positive relationship between paternal and maternal guan  with filial piety and adolescents' life satisfaction. Greater s' filial piety was linked to higher life satisfaction among adolescents. Findings from the mediation models indicated the association among guan  with filial piety, gratitude toward s, and higher life satisfaction. The findings  offered empirical evidence to the underlying mechanism of how guan  could affect adolescent life satisfaction via the mediating role of filial piety. The findings  supported the importance of culture-infused  in inculcating adolescents' filial piety besides establishing its link to life satisfaction in Asian families."
Educating dog owners: how owner-dog interactions can benefit from addressing the human caregiving system and dog-directed parenting styles,2021,"Dogs need to adapt to a human environment to enhance their welfare and to avoid risks of undesired dog behaviour and relinquishment. Crucial to this adaptation may be how an owner interacts with the dog. Owner-dog interactions may be influenced by the human caregiving system with regard to how care, protection and resources are provided. This narrative review discusses how a consideration of the human caregiving system can benefit owner-dog interactions. Literature suggests that the human caregiving system and   could influence owner-dog interactions. Owner- dog education may improve these interactions. However, studies on owner-dog education  mixed outcomes for the dog. Also, only a few studies address owner outcomes, indicating a gap that needs filling. It is concluded that, when intervening in owner-dog interactions, more attention should be directed to aspects of human psychology. Dog-directed   can form one strategy as to improve owner-dog interactions and dog welfare."
Validity and reliability of the Italian version of the Measure Of Parental Style (MOPS),2013,"Objective The links between  and mental health are a major topic of  in psychiatry. Research on the correlates of dysfunctional or inadequate  relies on the availability of valid and reliable measures of al . Our main aim was to develop and validate the Italian version of the Measure Of al Style (MOPS). A secondary aim was to test the reliability of an Italian version of the al Bonding Instrument (PBI) that was specifically designed for this . Methods An Italian version of the MOPS and PBI was produced using multiple independent bilingual translators. The questionnaires were administered to a non-clinical sample of adults (N = 154). A sub-sample (N = 73) completed the instruments again one month later. Results As expected, MOPS maternal and paternal Indifference were moderately to highly negatively correlated with PBI maternal and paternal Care, respectively. Also, MOPS Overcontrol was moderately to highly correlated with PBI maternal and paternal Overprotection, respectively. Moreover, MOPS maternal and paternal Abuse displayed a moderate negative correlation with PBI maternal and paternal Care, and a small though significant correlation with PBI maternal and paternal Overprotection. Furthermore, the MOPS and the PBI subscales were found to be reliable in terms of internal consistency and absolute as well as relative stability. Conclusions Given their satisfactory psychometric properties, the MOPS and PBI hold promise for clinicians and ers interested in the links between quality of  and mental health."
Gender-specific factors associated with the suicidal ideation of  in Taiwan: A large-scale cross-sectional study,2019,"We examined the relationship between suicidal ideation (SI) and the depressed mood, life stress and   in . A large-scale survey was conducted including 5328  from 65 elementary schools in Taiwan. SI was measured by asking  if any suicidal thoughts had occurred in the previous month. A series of regression models was analysed separately for male and female students. Compared with boys, girls demonstrated a higher proportion of SI. Among boys, SI was significantly associated with a high level of perceived environmental stress (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=2.61), a high degree of depressed mood (aOR=2.39), authoritative (aOR=1.72) and authoritarian (aOR=2.53)   and two or more life-stress events (aOR=1.45). A high level of perceived environmental stress (aOR=2.09), a high degree of depressed mood (aOR=2.89) and an authoritarian   (aOR=1.76) were significantly associated with the SI in girls. Gender-specific interventions aimed at preventing SI must enhance support systems at school and at home, particularly for students who suffer from a high degree of stress and depressed mood, and are subjected to an authoritarian  ."
Constructing an alternative family unit: families living with HIV/AIDS redefine African traditional parenting patterns,2011,"This article is based on a , conducted at Inanda, of caregivers who mainly take care of  that are infected and/or affected by HIV/AIDS.1 It explores the reality and experiences of the family members. The focus of the article is based on data analysed following interviews with the caregivers. Family  experience portrays HIV/AIDS caregiving as an intense, emotional and powerful experience, filled with pride and hope as well as exclusion. Findings of the  reflect a change in the definition and practice of . Another finding is that HIV/AIDS is forcing a redefinition of the concept and practice of  beyond the traditional boundaries of age, sex and gender. One of the main findings of the  was that the respondents'  practices and coping strategies are largely influenced by a strong commitment to the wellbeing of the . The  found that, in relation to some community members, the respondents have a different  . Their commitment depicts their self-sacrifice, an indication of some continuity in what is expected of African  practice. The thesis of this article is that the HIV/AIDS context is principally responsible for a shift in the understanding of the concept and practice of  within an African context."
Effective and Ineffective Parenting: Associations With Psychological Adjustment in Emerging Adults,2016,"The current  examined the impact of effective and ineffective  on emerging adult psychological adjustment as well as  characteristics associated with adjusted and maladjusted emerging adults. Participants were 175 male and 309 female emerging adults who completed questionnaires assessing their perceptions of their s'  practices, discipline strategies, and psychopathology as well as their own psychological adjustment. Participants reporting effective  from two s experienced the best adjustment, whereas participants reporting ineffective  from two s experienced the worst adjustment, and participants reporting effective  from at least one  appeared to be protected against the particularly harmful effects of ineffective  from two s. al psychopathology, harsh discipline, involvement, and regard for  and  all strongly differentiated adjusted and maladjusted participants."
Parenting Practices and Adolescent Effortful Control: MAOA T941G Gene Polymorphism as a Moderator,2020,"Effortful control (EC) plays a crucial role in psychopathology disorders. Emerging studies have paid attention to the effects of G x E interaction on EC. The   investigated interactions between monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) T941G polymorphism with  practices on EC in a sample of 1,531 Chinese adolescents. The adolescents completed the Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire-Revised (EATQ-R) EC scale and the  Style Index provided during the  to assess EC and  practices, respectively. MAOA T941G polymorphism exerted no effect on adolescent EC; however,  revealed that the MAOA gene interacted with al acceptance/involvement in their associations with EC among boys. Specifically, although increased levels of al acceptance/involvement benefited all adolescents, boys with G alleles of the MAOA gene exhibited higher sensitivity to al acceptance/involvement, compared with T carriers; this interaction was not significant among girls. This  is the first to identify MAOA x  interaction on adolescent EC, further contributing to the literature in MAOA gene-EC."
Parenting practices as mediating variables between parents' psychopathology and oppositional defiant disorder in preschoolers,2014,"Background: Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is very frequent in preschoolers. The severity and the long-term negative outcomes make the understanding of this disorder a priority. The goal in this  was to assess the mediating role of  practices in the relationship between s' psychopathology and ODD in preschoolers. Method: A community sample of 622  was assessed longitudinally at age 3 and age 5. s reported on 's psychopathology through a diagnostic interview, and on their own psychological state and   through questionnaires. Results: At ages 3 and 5, corporal punishment mediated the relationships between mothers' anxiety-depression and ODD (in girls), between mothers' aggressive behavior and ODD (in boys), and between s' rule-breaking and ODD both in boys and girls. For both sexes, there was a direct association between mothers' aggressive behavior score and ODD. The association between fathers' psychopathology and ODD was not mediated by the fathers'  practices. Fathers' anxiety-depression and aggressive behavior scores were directly associated with ODD. Conclusions: s' psychopathology must be explored and, in families where such psychopathology is a relevant variable,  practices must be addressed with a view to the prevention and treatment of 's ODD in the preschool years."
Parents' Qualitative Perspectives on Child Asking for Fruit and Vegetables,2017,"Children can influence the foods available at home, but some ways of approaching a  may be better than others; and the best way may vary by type of . This  explored how s with different   would best receive their 10 to 14 years old  asking for fruits and vegetables (FV). An online   questionnaire was completed and follow-up qualitative telephone interviews assessed home food rules,  influence on home food availability, s' preferences for being asked for food, and common barriers and reactions to their 's FV requests. s (n = 73) with a 10 to 14 years old  were grouped into authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, or uninvolved   categories based on responses to questionnaires, and interviewed. Almost no differences in responses were detected by   or ethnicity. s reported their  had a voice in what foods were purchased and available at home and were receptive to their 's asking for FV. The most important  asking characteristic was politeness, especially among authoritarian s. Other important factors were asking in person, helping in the grocery store, writing requests on the grocery shopping list, and showing information they saw in the media. The barrier raising the most concern was FV cost, but FV quality and safety outside the home environment were  considerations."
Emotional Intelligence and Cognitive Flexibility in the Relationship Between Parenting and Subjective Well-Being,2021,"Although ample evidence exists that  is associated with 's subjective well-being, ers have not yet empirically examined the potential mechanism of this relationship. In this , we consider emotional intelligence and cognitive flexibility as crucial capacities that could mediate the relationships between various  strategies (e.g., authoritative and authoritarian ) and young adults' well-being (e.g., a high level of life satisfaction and lower levels of mental disorders). We collected survey data from 439 Taiwanese young adults aged 18 through 24. Via structural equation modeling analysis, we found that (a) authoritative  positively relates to young adults' life satisfaction and negatively relates to their mental disorders, whereas authoritarian  positively relates to their mental disorders; (b) emotional intelligence mediates the relationship between authoritative  and young adults' life satisfaction; and (c) cognitive flexibility mediates the relationship between authoritative and authoritarian  and young adults' mental disorders. These  highlight the importance of democratic, warm, and responsive  that helps shape young adults' cognitive flexibility, emotional intelligence, and subjective well-being."
Controlling parenting and perfectionism is associated with an increased error-related negativity (ERN) in young adults,2020,"A substantial amount of  focuses on the error-related negativity (ERN)-a negative deflection in the event-related potential waveform that occurs when individuals commit errors on lab-based tasks. The ERN has been link to concurrent and prospective risk for psychopathology and is thought to index sensitivity or reactivity to errors. The ERN can be potentiated in the lab with punishment and has been shown to be increased among offspring of harsh or controlling s. A separate line of work has demonstrated that the ERN is increased among individuals high in perfectionism. In the current , we integrate these separate lines of work by examining  , perfectionism and the ERN in a sample of young adults. Results suggest that the ERN is increased among offspring of controlling s (both maternal and paternal). Additionally, the ERN is increased among individuals who report being high in perfectionism-specifically, the concerns over mistake and the personal standard perfectionism subscales of the Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale. Moreover,  supported a mediation model wherein the indirect pathway from controlling   to perfectionism (personal standard subscale) was mediated by the ERN-for paternal ."
Understanding Parenting Influence on Chinese University Students' Well-Being,2017,"Because emotional and behavioural problems among young adults are an evolving public health concern, it is critical to identify  behaviour in family of origin that prevents or exacerbates such problems. Further, it is particularly important to focus on university students in China, a country with rapid growth in university student population and changing dynamics of . In this , I proposed and tested the impact of multiple dimensions of  behaviour (al warmth, hostility and overprotection) during hood and adolescent years on behavioural and emotional problems (anxiety, depression and drinking behaviour) among Chinese university students who were entering university and starting their independent living. Using a sample of 545 university students attending a large university in China,  from logistic and multiple linear regression analyses suggested that: (1) fathers' hostility was associated with university students' report of drinking and anxiety, and (2) mothers' overprotection was associated with anxiety and depression. Lack of findings on the effects of al warmth may suggest cultural variation in expression of al warmth. Further, the findings revealed some gender differences in  behaviour. Other demographics were  included. Implications for cross-cultural comparisons and  and university student health interventions were discussed."
Mothers' and Fathers' Roles in Child Adjustment: Parenting Practices and Mothers' Emotion Socialization as Predictors,2018,"Grounded in a conceptual model of family processes underlying socioemotional development and a contextual model of  , the   addresses the associations between  practices, mothers' emotion socialization, and  adjustment in middle hood. A total of 217 families involving mothers, fathers, and 8-year-old  (101 boys, 116 girls) were recruited to participate in this . Findings suggested that fathers' inconsistent discipline and positive  practices predicted greater and fewer 's adjustment problems, respectively, over and above the effect of mothers'  practices. Mothers' emotion discussion with  predicted 's lower externalizing problems. Mothers' emotion discussion further buffered the association between mothers' inconsistent discipline and 's internalizing problems, such that  exhibited fewer internalizing problems when mothers engaged in moderate to high levels of emotion discussion with . Supporting family systems theory, both mothers' and fathers'  processes contributed to  development. These findings add to the literature by providing evidence for cumulative family asset and risk underlying  adjustment. Based on the findings, scholars and practitioners may consider adding more emotion-based components of  to existing interventions that focus on  discipline."
"Prolonged grief in refugees, parenting behaviour and 's mental health",2021,"Background: Many refugees experience bereavement, and as a  they suffer elevated rates of prolonged grief disorder. Evidence  indicates that elevated rates of psychological disturbance in refugee  can be associated with al mental health. This  examined the extent to which prolonged grief disorder in refugees is associated with their  behaviour and in turn with their 's mental health. Methods: This  recruited participants from the Building a New Life in Australia prospective cohort  of refugees admitted to Australia between October 2013 and February 2014. The current data were collected in 2015-2016 and comprised 1799 adults, as well as 411  of the adult respondents. Adult refugees were assessed for trauma history, post-migration difficulties, harsh and warm , probable prolonged grief disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. Children were administered the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. The current analyses on bereaved refugees comprise 110 caregivers and 178 . Results: In this cohort, 37% of bereaved refugees reported probable prolonged grief disorder. Path analysis indicated that caregivers' grief was directly associated with 's emotional difficulties. Caregiver warmth was associated with reduced emotional problems in  of refugees with minimal grief but associated with more emotional problems in caregivers with more severe grief. More harsh  was associated with 's conduct problems, and this was more evident in those with less severe grief. Conclusion: Severity of prolonged grief disorder is directly linked to refugee 's mental health. The association between  , grief severity and 's mental health highlights that managing grief reactions in refugees can benefit both refugees and their ."
"AGE, GENDER, AND PARENTING STYLE VARIATIONS IN MOTHER ADOLESCENT DIALOGUES AND ADOLESCENT REASONING ABOUT POLITICAL ISSUES",1994,"This  investigated al socialization of adolescent political reasoning from a Vygotskian cognitive socialization perspective. Discussions between mothers and their adolescent sons or daughters were examined using a transactive dialogue system and were related to the adolescent's age and gender and to family  . These discussions were predicted to influence the complexity of adolescents' subsequent reasoning about political issues. As hypothesized, older adolescents showed more complexity of political reasoning on a pretest than did younger adolescents. Mothers used more sophisticated transacts with sons than with daughters in the discussions. As well, older female adolescents used more higher level operational transacts than did younger females. This predicted developmental trend did not occur for males. Also as predicted, authoritative family  were linked to greater complexity of adolescent political reasoning on the pretest, but there was no evidence that the brief discussions enhanced the complexity of adolescent political thinking on a posttest 1 week later. Nevertheless, variations in family processes may be linked to differential socialization of political reasoning over the long term, consistent with a cognitive socialization model."
Patterns of Parenting in Korean Mothers of Children With ADHD A Q-Methodology Study,2009,"The purpose of this  was to investigate patterns of  in Korean mothers of  with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and identify major threads that structured various patterns of . Q-methodology, a technique for extracting subjective attitudes, was used for data collection and analysis. Participants were asked to sort statements on issues associated with . Factor analysis was applied to identify patterns in the ranking of statements. Participants were 45 Korean mothers of  with ADHD. As a , three patterns of  emerged: Praise-Fairness, Strict-Control, and Sensitive Response-Balanced. These patterns differed on two axes: external and internal control and positive and negative reinforcement. This  provides an opportunity to enhance our understanding of the  patterns of mothers of  with ADHD in Korea. The findings can function as a cornerstone for developing future models of   with ADHD and - interactions."
Income Relates to Adherence in Youth with Type 1 Diabetes Through Parenting Constructs,2018,"Objective: Informed by the family stress and family investment models, this  investigated whether income is indirectly related to adherence and glycemic control through  constructs among youth with type 1 diabetes (TID). Methods: Youth and their families (n = 390) from 4 geographically dispersed pediatric endocrinology clinics in the United States were participants in a multisite clinical trial from 2006 to 2009 examining the efficacy of a clinic-integrated behavioral intervention targeting family disease management for youth with TID. Baseline data were collected from youth aged 9 to 14 years and their s. s reported family income and completed a semistructured interview assessing diabetes management adherence. s and  reported diabetes-specific - conflict. Children completed measures of collaborative  involvement and authoritative . Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a biomarker of glycemic control, was analyzed centrally at a reference laboratory. The relations of income,  variables, regimen, adherence, and HbA1c were examined using structural equation modeling. Results: Lower family income was associated with greater - conflict and a less authoritative  . Authoritative  was associated with more collaborative  involvement and less - conflict, both of which were associated with greater adherence, which was associated with more optimal glycemic control (p < 0.05 all associations). Indirect effects of family income on adherence and glycemic control through  constructs were significant (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Findings lend support for the family stress and family investment models, suggesting that lower family income may negatively impact - constructs, with adverse effects on diabetes management."
Early parenting beliefs and academic achievement: the mediating role of language,2013,"Studies have demonstrated the association between   and 's academic achievement, but the specific mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear. The development of skills that lay the foundation for academic success might be found in early - interactions that foster language competence. Early negative  beliefs, characterised by a lack of reciprocal - interactions may put a 's developing language at risk, which then compromises a 's subsequent academic success. The   investigated this idea by using longitudinal data and structural equation modelling on a sample of 1364  at 1 month and 36 months and in kindergarten and grade 1 (National Institute of Child Health and Human Development  of Early Child Care and Youth Development). Authoritarian beliefs were measured at 1 month and in grade 1. Language competence was measured at 36 months and in kindergarten, and academic achievement in kindergarten and grade 1. We found that 's language functioning at 36 months fully mediates the association between early negative  beliefs and 's subsequent academic achievement."
Acceleration for working sole parents: Squeezed between institutional temporalities and routinised parenting practices,2016,"There are many theories of what is causing a sense of social acceleration and the time squeeze' in modern society, such as the notion that individuals are doing more' through increased consumption, or the increasing difficulty that many people face coordinating with networks due to de-synchronised and de-routinised employment and life- practices. In this regard qualitative empirical work has often been focused on dual-income middle-class couples. To explore an under-developed area, this article considers the socio-temporal organisation of 10 working sole fathers' and 17 working sole mothers' daily lives. This  finds that for working sole s a sense of time squeeze or acceleration is principally due to structural aspects of workplaces and  practices. In particular,  routines, school and care times and work times are fixed events which create a time squeeze in the mornings and evenings. These normative and structural temporalities appear more influential on working sole s' daily lives than consumption norms or de-synchronisation aspects of managing networks."
A Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Life Satisfaction and Parenting,2010,"This  examined longitudinal relationships between adolescent life satisfaction (LS) and perceived al support, al behavioral control, and al autonomy granting. A total of 819 students in grades 6-12 completed the Students' Life Satisfaction Scale (Huebner 1991), the Family Support Scale (FSS; Wills and Clearly 1996), and the al Control and al Autonomy Granting subscales of the Authoritative  Measure (APM; Lamborn et al. 1991) on two occasions, 1 year apart. Analyses revealed that none of the  behaviors at Time 1 predicted changes in LS at Time 2. Additionally, LS at Time 1 did not predict changes in al control or autonomy granting at Time 2, but did predict changes in al support at Time 2. Implications and future  needs are discussed."

Parenting Profiles of Young Low-income African American and Latina Mothers and Infant Socioemotional Development,2020,"SYNOPSIS Objective.   are complex and have been well studied in s of  and adolescents; however, less is known about   in early infancy, especially among ethnic minority groups. This  examines empirically identifiable profiles of early  that are associated with later infant socioemotional development. Design. 239 young, low-income, African American (54.8%) and Latina (45.2%) mothers were videorecorded with their 3-month-old infants. At 13-months, mothers reported on their infants' socioemotional development. Results. Person-oriented latent class analysis was used to identify four  : Sensitive/Stimulating (25%), Warm/Unstimulating (37%), Engaged/Tough (22%), and Disengaged (16%). The most common  among African American mothers was Engaged/Tough (34.4%), and the most prevalent  among Latina mothers was Warm/Unstimulating (48.2%). Infants of Warm/Unstimulating mothers had the lowest reported levels of problem behavior at 13 months, whereas infants of Sensitive/Stimulating mothers had the highest reported mastery motivation. Infants of Disengaged mothers had the highest reported levels of internalizing and total problem behavior and the lowest reported mastery motivation. Conclusions. Qualitatively distinct  of early  link to different infant socioemotional outcomes in ways not fully captured by single dimensions of .

Using Identity Style and Parental Identification to Predict Political Orientation,2012,"There has been a recent increase in interest in the psychological differences and antecedents related to political orientation. Personality, disgust sensitivity, attachment, and closeness to s have all been found or have been theorized to be predictive of political orientation. These variables and the additional roles played by normative identity  and al identification were examined. The  showed that normative identity  is associated with political orientation and that the role played by al identification depends on the perceived al political ranking, the gender of the , and the measure used to examine political orientation. No support was found for Lakoff's (2002) model of  and political orientation."
Self-Determination Theory and Food-Related Parenting: The Parent Socioemotional Context of Feeding Questionnaire,2019,"There has been wide application of Self-Determination Theory (SDT) to understanding motivation and regulation of eating and weight. Yet, there are no measures of the socioemotional-contextual family conditions in the eating domain, which are identified in SDT and should influence development of eating behavior in young . Two studies were conducted to develop and validate a measure to assess the SDT socioemotional-contextual dimensions of food-related . These dimensions were derived from extensions of SDT, which argue that autonomy support, warmth, and appropriate structure (as well as low coercion, hostility, and chaos) are the conditions that will fulfill 's psychological needs for autonomy, relatedness and competence, ing in more intrinsic motivation and better self-regulation of behavior. In the first , 230 s completed the food-related  items in reference to their 4- to 8-year-old , and the factor structure and construct and convergent validity of the items were examined. Generally consistent with SDT, factors suggested 4 food-related socioemotional  contexts of supportiveness (autonomy support/warmth), coerciveness (coercion/hostility), structure, and chaos. In a second  of 221 s, a 24-item  Socioemotional Context of Feeding Questionnaire (PSCFQ) was confirmed to have a 4-factor structure. In each , good reliability was found for each subscale. Construct, convergent, and divergent validity were supported by small to moderate correlations with aspects of  feeding (e.g., restriction) and general  . PSCFQ subscales were not associated with  BMI, family income or  education."
"Quality of life in adolescence: The role of perceived control, parenting style, and social support",2000,"Adult levels of subjective quality of life (SQOL) are remarkably stable on a population basis. This has been explained through the operation of a homeostatic system that acts to maintain each individual's SQOL within a narrow range. However, there are good reasons to expect this homeostatic system to come under severe challenge during adolescence. Many of the variables thought to be involved in the homeostatic process are undergoing marked change during this period, including the balance between primary and secondary control, perceived social support, and interaction with s. In order to test the stability of SQOL and the influence of these other variables, a sample of 279 adolescents between the ages of 12 to 17 years were recruited. It was found that the SQOL of the older adolescents lay below the predicted range for adults, thereby supporting the idea of a strong challenge to homeostasis during this period. A new scale to measure perceived control was found to possess a useful two-factor structure of primary and secondary control. Moreover, both of these factors, together with social support, predicted levels of SQOL, even though the levels of primary control decreased with age. Finally, adolescents who perceived an authoritarian   experienced a higher SQOL than those who perceived an unengaged . These findings contribute to our understanding of SQOL homeostasis."
Parental attitudes toward their parenting styles and 's competence in families whose  are Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) carriers in Guangzhou China,1999,"The purpose of the  was to examine the hypothesis that the differences of al attitudes toward their HBV and healthy  would affect their reports on their   and their HBV and healthy 's competence development. Ninty Chinese s and their Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and healthy  participated in this . These families resided in the city of Guangzhou. The  was divided into two parts, the first part was the focus groups interviews, mother subjects were interviewed in the focus groups to discuss their attitudes toward their HBV and healthy , then they were asked to report their   and their 's competence in two standardized scales. The findings of this  had indicated that mothers of non-school HBV  were experiencing the most stressful situation because of social discrimination, compared with the mothers of HBV  who attended the special health kindergarten or ordinary mothers. The quality of mother- interaction, and their satisfaction with their HBV 's performance were  affected. However, mothers' reports on their   and 's competence were not different significantly among the groups. Mothers who were short of knowledge and who held false concepts about HBV were  the main reasons for rejection of HBV  in general."
PARENTING AND FAMILY STRESS AS MEDIATORS OF THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF CHILD-ABUSE,1994,"Child abuse is known to be associated with a variety of adult psychological difficulties. However, the level and types of such difficulties may be influenced by variation in other nonabusive aspects of the -rearing context. This  examines whether variation in perceived al warmth and in nonabusive family stressors influenced the strength of relationships of women's psychological difficulties to their hood sexual and/or physical abuse. Child abuse, family stress histories, and perceived al warmth, as well as current psychological functioning was gathered from a community sample of 259 working women. Perceived al warmth, hood stress, and abuse were each separately associated with current functioning. However, as expected, multiple regression analyses showed that al warmth strongly influenced or mediated the relationship of intrafamilial  abuse to depression and self-esteem levels. In contrast, abuse was associated to PTSD independently of variation in perceived . Finally,  mediated initial relationships of hood stress to each of the adjustment measures. The Discussion focuses on the possibility that there may be several developmental pathways that lead to the array bf symptoms associated with  abuse. Some symptoms, such as PTSD, may be most influenced by the abuse itself, while others, such as depression, and low self-esteem may be more impacted by lack of al warmth. Treatment implications are discussed."
"Helicopter Parenting, Autonomy Support, and College Students' Mental Health and Well-being: The Moderating Role of Sex and Ethnicity",2017,"Whereas al involvement is consistently linked with positive  outcomes throughout development, al involvement that is not developmentally appropriate and intrusive-a  of  called helicopter -can be problematic for their 's adjustment and well-being. Helicopter  can be particularly harmful during emerging adulthood when young adults are working toward developmental goals of self-reliance and autonomy. The purpose of this  was to examine sex differences in the relation between helicopter  and autonomy support on college students' mental health and well-being. A secondary aim was to explore the extent to which there were ethnic differences (non-Hispanic White vs. Hispanic) in associations between  and college students' outcomes. We examined several domains of mental health, including dysphoria symptoms, social anxiety, and general well-being. A sample of 118 undergraduate students (Mage = 19.82 years, SD = 1.38; 83.1 % female; 57 % European American) completed measures of  and mental health and well-being. The  showed that higher levels of helicopter  predicted lower levels of well-being for females, whereas higher levels of autonomy support predicted lower levels of dysphoria symptoms and social anxiety among males. No ethnic differences were found. The findings highlight that s' behavior continues to predict their 's well-being even in emerging adulthood, and that  may differentially predict male and female college students' mental health outcomes."
"Defense Mechanisms, Remembered Parental Caregiving, and Adult Attachment Style",2019,"The empirical  of defense mechanisms has taken place in relative isolation, with few connections to other fields deriving from psychodynamic theories, including attachment. This  aimed to explore the associations of remembered hood caregiving and defense mechanisms with adult attachment  in a nonclinical sample. Furthermore, we investigated which defenses are associated with specific insecure attachment . Participants were 238 university students (mean age = 28.11 years, SD = 9.42; 24.4% male) who volunteered to complete a set of questionnaires including the Response Evaluation Measure-71. the Attachment Style Questionnaire, and the Measure of  Style. The main contribution to adult attachment  is given by immature defenses. which are associated with all dimensions of insecure attachment. and inversely related to secure attachment. Mature defenses seemed to play a secondary role because they predicted only secure attachment significantly. Maternal and paternal rearing  showed no significant effect on attachment scores. with the only exception of paternal abuse on need for approval and maternal overprotection on preoccupation with relationships and relationships as secondary. Splitting and repression emerged as mechanisms that characterized the avoidant dimension of insecure attachment, whereas the anxious dimension of attachment showed associations with projection and fantasy. The  support the hypothesis that immature defenses are a correlate of insecure attachment in adults and that specific defense configurations are associated with the avoidant and anxious components of attachment."

Additive effects of household food insecurity during pregnancy and infancy on maternal infant feeding styles and practices,2018,"Food insecurity, or the limited access to food, has been associated with maternal  feeding  and practices. While studies in other  domains suggest differential and additive impacts of poverty-associated stressors during pregnancy and infancy, few studies have assessed relations between food insecurity during these sensitive times and maternal infant feeding  and practices. This  sought to analyze these relations in low-income Hispanic mother-infant pairs enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of an early obesity prevention program (Starting Early). Food insecurity was measured prenatally and during infancy at 10 months. Food insecurity timing was categorized as never, prenatal only, infancy only, or both. Regression analyses were used to determine relations between food insecurity timing and  and practices at 10 months, using never experiencing food insecurity as the reference, adjusting for family characteristics and material hardships. 412 mother-infant pairs completed 10-month assessments. Prolonged food insecurity during both periods was associated with greater pressuring, indulgent and laissez-faire  compared to never experiencing food insecurity. Prenatal food insecurity was associated with less vegetable and more juice intake. If food insecurity is identified during pregnancy, interventions to prevent food insecurity from persisting into infancy may mitigate the development of obesity-promoting feeding  and practices."
Leadership through service: An exploratory study of the leadership styles of tour leaders,2012,"The group package tour is one of the main modes of outbound travel in many parts of Asia. Tour leaders are part of the product and are therefore key front-line players in the tourism industry as they service guests during a journey. A tour leader's  of leadership transforms a tourist visit from a tour into an experience and is a critical factor affecting a tourist's satisfaction with their tour. This  identifies the various different  of tour leadership using in-depth interviews to collect data. Three dimensions of leadership  in tour leaders were found: concern for tasks, concern for customers, and concern for controlling the group climate.

"The Reciprocal Influence of Callous-Unemotional Traits, Oppositional Defiant Disorder and Parenting Practices in Preschoolers",2017,"The   investigates reciprocal associations between positive , al monitoring, CU traits, and ODD in  assessed at age 3 and again at age 6. Data were collected from a sample of preschoolers (N = 419; 51.58 % female) through diagnostic interviews and questionnaires answered by s and teachers. Structural equation modeling revealed a bidirectional relationship between poor monitoring and ODD, with poor monitoring at age 3 predicting ODD at age 6 (beta = 0.11, p < 0.05), and ODD at age 3 predicting poor monitoring at age 6 (beta = 0.10, p < 0.05). While poor monitoring at age 3 predicted CU traits at age 6 (beta = 0.11, p < 0.05), CU traits at age 3 predicted positive  (beta = 0.09, p < 0.05) and ODD (beta = 0.13, p < 0.05) at age 6. Results have important implications for early targeted  interventions for CU traits and ODD."
Overprotective/authoritarian maternal parenting is associated with an enhanced error-related negativity (ERN) in emerging adult females,2019,"Error monitoring is crucial for survival and adaptation, and can be indexed by the error-related negativity (ERN), a fronto-centrally located negative deflection in the event-related potential (ERP) waveform that differentiates erroneous from correct responses within 100 ms of a response. The ERN is seen as an early neural signal indicating the need to adjust performance and increase executive control. Previous findings indicate that punishing errors increases ERN magnitude, and that punitive  predicts an enhanced ERN in . If punitive  can in fact sensitize  to error commission over the long term, an enhanced ERN should be seen in adults who experienced harsh  as . The   thus sought to establish whether punitive  is associated with an enhanced ERN in emerging adulthood. A sample of 70 emerging adult females reported on their mothers' and fathers'   separately and performed a flanker task to elicit the ERN. Higher reported overprotective/authoritarian maternal behavior was associated with an enhanced ERN. These  provide further support for the hypothesis that punitive  may lead to long-term sensitization of neural networks involved in performance monitoring."
Attributional style as a mediator between parental abuse risk and  internalizing symptomatology,2006,"This  examined a model wherein 's attributional  mediates the relationship between al physical -abuse risk and 's internalizing problems. Using structural equation modeling, three indices of abuse risk, were selected ( abuse potential, physical discipline use, and dysfunctional  ) and two indices of 's internalizing problems (depression and anxiety). The sample included 75 - dyads, in which s reported on their abuse risk and  independently completed measures of depressive and anxious symptomatology and a measure on their attributional . Findings supported, the model that s attributional  for positive events (but not negative events) partially mediated the relationship between abuse risk and internalizing symptoms, with significant direct and indirect effects of abuse risk on internalizing symptomatology. Future directions to continue evaluating additional mediators and other possible contextual variables are discussed."
Alcohol Use and Associated Environmental Factors Among Middle and High School Students in Sfax (Tunisia),2020,"Our objective was to investigate the prevalence and the environmental determinants of alcohol use among students in the region of Sfax in Tunisia. We carried out a cross-sectional  among 315 middle and high school students. We used the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) to identify risky alcohol consumption, and we used the  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ) to assess the students' perceptions of their s'  . The  show that 19.7% reported drinking alcohol at least once in their lifetime. Among them, 21% scored as dependent alcohol users, according to the AUDIT. Those who drank alcohol at least once were more likely to have s with a permissive   (p < 0.001; Cramer's V = 0.287), and a father (p < 0.001; Cramer's V = 0.258), a mother (p = 0.025; Cramer's V = 0.158), or a friend (p < 0.001; Cramer's V = 0.341) who drinks. Students perceiving their s'   as permissive had the highest AUDIT score (p = 0.005; partial eta(2) = 0.132). The authoritarian  score was significantly higher for students who were current alcohol users (p = 0.028; Cohen's d = 0.57). Our  highlights the influence of peers, family drinking, and   on alcohol use among middle and high school students. Therefore, particular attention should be given to students that are at risk of having the abovementioned environmental determinants of alcohol use. And, prevention strategies should involve s, as well as enhanced guidance and counseling for these students."
"Culture, Parenting, and Children's Theory of Mind Development in Indonesia",2017,"Children's theory of mind (ToM) unfolds reliably through a sequence of conceptual milestones including, but not limited to, false belief. Sequences vary with culture, one observed previously in Western cultures (Australia, the United States) and another in two non-Western cultures, China and Iran. Two explanations for cross-cultural sequence differences have been suggested: (a) collectivism versus individualism or (b) authoritarian versus authoritative . However, neither has been directly tested empirically. Our goal was to do so. Children (n = 122, aged 4-6) in Indonesia (a collectivist culture) took Wellman and Liu's ToM Scale. Their mothers completed two self-report measures evaluating their attitudes to (a) collectivism/individualism and (b) authoritarian versus authoritative . Indonesian mothers preferred collectivism to individualism and authoritativeness to authoritarianism. Child ToM was negatively correlated with authoritarianism but unrelated to other al attitudes. ToM Scale sequences differed significantly between Javanese and Sundanese  in Indonesia and by city of residence but not with collectivism/individualism or  . Javanese  (primarily from Jakarta) matched the Western ToM Scale sequence, whereas Sundanese  (primarily from Bogor) matched the Chinese/Iranian sequence. Findings highlight benefits of going beyond broad characterizations to directly examine how culture, ethnicity, and  relate to ToM sequences and development."
Relations between Chinese mothers' parenting practices and social withdrawal in early hood,2006,"Researchers have identified specific  practices used by s of preschoolers in mainland China (e.g., physical coercion, overprotection, shaming, directiveness, encouragement of modesty). Some of the intrusive practices have been linked to social withdrawal in western societies (e.g., United States, Canada). It seemed important to examine these associations in China because recent  suggests that young Chinese  who exhibit wariness in peer settings may be at risk for negative outcomes such as peer rejection. Therefore, the purpose of this  was to examine the relation between Chinese  practices and preschoolers' social withdrawal. Mothers of preschool-age  from mainland China (N = 446) completed self-report  questionnaires. Teachers rated 's reticent, solitary-passive, solitary-active, and modest behaviors. Results showed that (a) maternal directiveness was positively associated with reticent behavior in girls and negatively associated with solitary-passive behavior in boys, (b) maternal overprotection, for girls, was positively related to both reticent behavior and solitary-passive behavior, and negatively related to modest behavior, (c) coercion was positively associated with solitary-active and reticent behavior in girls, and (d) shaming was positively related to all forms of withdrawn behaviors in boys and girls. as well as positively related to modest behavior in boys."
Stress-induced plasma cortisol concentrations in infancy are associated with later parenting behaviors in female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta),2021,"Few studies have longitudinally assessed the relationship between infant stress reactivity and future  . Studies show that stress-induced plasma cortisol concentrations are stable over development and that they can be utilized as a marker for stress reactivity. This  investigates the relationship between stress-induced plasma cortisol concentrations in infancy and later  behavior in a translational nonhuman primate model. We hypothesized that higher stress-induced cortisol levels in infancy would predict impairments in maternal behaviors in adulthood. Subjects were rhesus macaque females (N = 122; Macaca mulatta), assessed as infants and again as mothers. At 3-4 months of age, subjects underwent a standardized BioBehavioral Assessment during which blood samples were obtained and they were assessed for behaviorally inhibition. Approximately 7 years later, subjects were observed as they interacted with their own offspring for four 300-s sessions. Typical rhesus monkey mother-offspring behaviors were recorded, including approaches and leaves and maternal cradling. Results showed that subjects' stress-induced cortisol concentrations and whether they exhibited behavioral inhibition as infants predicted later maternal behavior, with high cortisol concentrations and behavioral inhibition predicting high rates of offspring approaches and leaves and low rates of maternal cradling. Results  showed that higher stress-induced cortisol concentrations in infancy predicted higher scores on the Brown Index, an indication that the subjects' offspring, rather than the subject themselves, initiated changes in proximity. Taken together, these  suggest that individuals that exhibit higher stress-induced cortisol concentrations and behavioral inhibition at 3-4 months of age are at risk for engaging in less sensitive  behaviors as adults. To the extent that these findings generalize to humans, they suggest an important link between stress-induced cortisol concentrations and behavioral inhibition in infancy and behavior later in life, such that early-life stress reactivity can serve as a marker for later  behavior."
Parenting Behavior and Juvenile Delinquency Among Low-Income Families,2018,"It is widely known that  behavior has an impact on the development of delinquent behavior among adolescents. However, there is paucity of studies focusing on  behavior and its relation to juvenile delinquency among low-income families from India. The authors examined a wide range of  behavior and its relationship to juvenile delinquency in low-income families among Indians. Data were collected from 27 juvenile delinquent boys who were residing temporarily in an observation home in Kolkata (West Bengal, India) and 100 matched control (with respect to their socioeconomic status) juvenile boys, 11-18 years old,  from the same city. The overall findings revealed that there were higher levels of permissive  in the families of delinquent adolescents. It may be because low-income families have many family members that initiated the adolescents to take up some jobs to increase the family income, and this in turn affected their s'  behavior."
Parents' Role in Adolescents' Sexting Behaviour,2018,"In this chapter we provide an overview of al  that are used by s, the application of these al  towards media use and the al mediation of sexual behaviour of adolescents. In adolescents' relational and sexual development, s may play a role in addressing health risks. As sexting has become a part of intimate communication for adolescents, sexting related risks could be addressed in s' sex education. Therefore, we integrate the findings of several studies on  and discuss which implications  may have for sexting behaviour. Investigating how  and al  could impact upon sexting behaviour is important, as this could lead to practical recommendations to s on how to prevent and deal with sexting related risks."
"Mother-Infant Emotion Regulation at Three Months: The Role of Maternal Anxiety, Depression and Parenting Stress",2016,"Background: While the association between anxiety and postpartum depression is well known, few studies have investigated the relationship between these two states and  stress. Furthermore, a number of studies have found that postpartum depression affects mother-infant emotion regulation, but there has been only one  on anxiety and emotion regulation and no studies at all on  stress and emotion regulation. Therefore, the primary aim of our  is to identify, in a community sample of 71 mothers, the relationship between maternal depression, anxiety, and  stress. The second aim is to examine the relationship between anxiety, postpartum depression, and  stress and mother-infant emotion regulation assessed at 3 months. Methods: Mother-infant interaction was coded with a modified version of the Infant Caregiver and Engagement Phases (ICEP) using a microanalytic approach. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and  Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF) were administered to the mothers to assess depression, anxiety, and  stress, respectively. Results: Analysis revealed correlations between anxiety and depression, showing that  stress is associated with both states. In a laboratory observation, depression was correlated with both negative maternal states and negative dyadic matches as well as infant positive/mother negative mismatches; anxiety was correlated with both negative maternal states and infant negative states as well as mismatches involving one of the partners having a negative state. Multiple regression analysis showed that anxiety is a greater predictor than depression of less adequate  of mother-infant emotion regulation.  stress was not shown to predict such regulation.

Applying ethnic equivalence and cultural values models to African-American teens' perceptions of parents,2003,"This  evaluated both the   and family ecologies models with interview responses from 93 14- and 15-year-old African-American adolescents. The   model was more strongly reed in both open-ended and structured interview responses. Using variables from the structured interview as independent variables, regression analyses contrasted each model with a joint model for predicting self-esteem, self-reliance, work orientation, and ethnic identity. Overall, the findings suggest that a joint model that combines elements from both models provides a richer understanding of African-American families.

Is Authoritative Teaching Beneficial for All Students? A Multi-Level Model of the Effects of Teaching Style on Interest and Achievement,2011,"This  examined the effects of the two facets of authoritative teaching high academic press and caring for students-on student interest and achievement in mathematics for middle and high school students (N = 3,602 in 198 classrooms), and whether those effects are moderated by students' ethnicity (Hispanic, Vietnamese, and Caucasian Non-Hispanic). Tested with hierarchical modeling, a trend suggested that the authoritative teaching  predicted higher levels of interest for Hispanic students; however, the trend for caring was approaching significance, which suggests that future  should be conducted to determine whether authoritative and authoritarian teaching  truly have different effects on interest for this group. Authoritarian teaching (high press and low caring) was positively related to interest for Vietnamese students. Results for Caucasian students did not differ from Hispanic students, but should be interpreted with caution due to small sample size. For all students, authoritarian teaching was positively associated with achievement gains. Results are discussed in terms of the relationships between teaching  and different academic outcomes among particular student groups, as informed by the   and teaching  literatures."
Parental perspectives: Risk and protective factors associated with parenting quality for parents of adolescents in secure residential care,2018,"Although al problems and poor  are commonly associated with adolescents' admission to secure residential care, few studies examined these al characteristics. This  aims to identify al problems and strengths and their association with   for 64 of these s. We assessed perspectives of both adolescents and their  figures shortly after admission. s often report high levels of psychopathology for both mothers and fathers, respectively, including depression (54.7% and 39.1%), anxiety (29.7% and 12.5%), substance dependence (14.1% and 26.6%), antisocial behaviour (1.6% and 21.1%), and psychosis (11.0% and 9.4%). s  report high  stress specifically related to the behaviour of their . In contrast to our expectations, most s experience a high quality of life. Living in a 1- family, being unemployed and having debts are most frequently mentioned risk factor combinations. We found limited support for the hypothesis that s with more risk and less protective factors show poorer . s with more psychopathology and  stress do show poorer  than s without these problems. Based on our findings, we describe several implications for engaging and supporting s of adolescents in secure residential care."
"IMMIGRATION EFFECTS ON PARENTING, STRESS, AND RISKY SEX AMONG HISPANIC IMMIGRANT YOUTH",2009,"For decades, there has been the generalized view that cultural differences from the country of origin and the host country threaten family relations and exacerbate the risk for immigrant youth to engage in unhealthy and risky behaviors. It has been argued that immigrant families' values, beliefs, and  practices are different from the ones found in the host country or are forced to change during the process of adaptation to the host culture, thus, affecting 's developmental outcomes (Isralowitz & Slonim-Nevo, 2002; Nauck, 2001). In the particular case of Hispanic immigrant youth, alarming official statistics on risky sexual behaviors appear to support this notion. Hispanic youth are reported to be at an increased risk for STDs, having sexual intercourse before age 13, and having four or more sexual partners (CDC, 2000; YRBS, 2004). Yet, limited scholarship exists on how  processes and perceived stress (e.g., limited social networks, unreceptive school environment) predict risky sexual behaviors across generations of Hispanic immigrant adolescents. Using a subsample from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health; Waves I & II), the current  examined the potential changes over time in  practices (e.g., monitoring, support, and communication) and stress (e.g., psychological well-being, perceived social support, perceived school stress) across 1(st) and 2(nd) generation immigrant Hispanic youth (N= 2,016) and their relationships to risky sexual behaviors. Even though GLM  show that maternal  and stress constructs indeed changed over time, changes were not significantly different across generational groups. In addition, maternal monitoring, maternal support, and measures of stress emerged as key predictors of risky sexual behaviors across both 1(st) and 2(nd) generation Hispanic immigrant youth over time, whereas no moderation effects were found by immigration status on developmental processes across generational groups. Therefore, findings suggest that even though cultural adaptation to the host culture might re a stressful process as documented by previous literature (e.g., Perez & Padilla, 2000; Rueschenberg & Buriel, 1989), immigration and stress do not appear to significantly affect  behaviors over time or their links to risky sexual behaviors across generations of Hispanic immigrant youth."
A Naturalistic Approach to the Study of Parenting,2012,"We   within the context of the family-its natural environment-using direct observations and repeated sampling, to describe the real-time unfolding of situations and responses to them. Longitudinal studies attempt to model the long-term impact that different  of  have on the psychological and physical development of offspring. But behavioral, emotional, and biological responses to  occur in the moment, with an immediate impact on the . We are interested in how those short-term responses come to influence developmental and health processes that play out over longer time spans. Our approach, which integrates measures of neuroendocrine and immune system function, has implications for ers and practitioners."
Parent Predictors of Adolescents' Explanatory Style,2015,"The current  tested the prospective relations (6-month lag) between three aspects of the - relationship at Time 1 (T1) and adolescents' explanatory  at Time 2 (T2): caregiving behaviors, s' explanatory  for their own negative events, and s' explanatory  for their 's negative events. The sample included 129 adolescents aged 11 to 14 years at baseline and their s. Adolescents reported on their own explanatory  and their s' caregiving behaviors; s self-reported on their caregiving behaviors and their explanatory  for their own and their 's events. Regression analyses identified maternal acceptance as a significant predictor of T2 adolescents' explanatory . Marginal effects emerged for fathers' psychological control and fathers' explanatory  for their 's events. Findings suggest that the ways sespecially mothersinteract with their  may play a role in adolescents' cognitive vulnerability to depression."
Early Parenting Characteristics Associated with Internalizing Symptoms Across Seven Waves of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children,2020,"The aim of this  was to identify whether   during a 's toddler years predicts the course of the 's internalising symptoms throughout early to middle hood. The current  uses data from waves 1 to 7 (acquired biennially) of the infant cohort (N = 4494) of Growing up in Australia: the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC), a population-based longitudinal . Latent class growth analysis identified four distinct longitudinal trajectories of internalizing symptoms: Low stable (66% of the ), High increasing (7%), Low increasing (17%) and High decreasing (10%). Multinomial logistic regression indicated that low self-efficacy and socioeconomic disadvantage during the toddler years were significant predictors of unfavourable (i.e., increasing) trajectories of internalizing symptoms across later hood.  hostility was a significant predictor of the low increasing trajectory. Additionally, male  were more likely than females to follow unfavourable trajectories. However, low  warmth was not predictive of increasing symptoms across time. Our findings highlight the importance of  factors in a 's early years, particularly the potentially detrimental outcomes associated with al hostility and low self-efficacy."
SELF-CONCEPT AND CHILDHOOD PERCEPTION OF PARENTING GUIDELINES,2019,"The importance of self-concept in the development of boys and girls has been widely investigated. However, there are few and recent  that investigates the relationship between self-concept and hood perception of  patterns. The main objective of this article is to contribute with new knowledge to the  of the self-concept of  and their relationship with the perception of  practices of their mothers, fathers and/or caregivers. The sample consisted of boys and girls of school age, belonging to urban areas of Argentina (M=9.58, DE=1.71). Instruments were administered to investigate aspects related to the ways of perceiving and valuing themselves, and the characteristics that they attribute to the attitudes and behaviors of their fathers and mothers. Significant relationships were found between the dimensions of support and perceived al control and self-concept. The more support they perceive, the greater their positive self-concept and the greater the perception of control, the lower their positive self-concept. It is concluded that rigid al control would function as antagonistic or differentiated from the perception of al support by , highlighting the importance of carrying out interventions in this type of relationship."
The Impact of Environmental Threats on Controlling Parenting and Children's Motivation,2020,"Past studies looking at antecedents of controlling  revealed an association between s' use of these detrimental practices and their perceptions of the environment as threatening for their . However, the causal impact of environmental threats on controlling practices remained to be assessed. This  filled this gap using an experimental design and a sample of 101  (M-age = 10.21 years) and their mothers. We manipulated mothers' perceptions of environmental threats, subsequently asked them to help their  complete a task in a guided learning setting, and obtained multi-informant observational measures of maternal controlling practices during this interaction. Results first showed that mothers with a high (but not low) controlling  were coded by an independent observer as significantly more controlling in the threat condition than in the control condition. Results  revealed that mothers in the threat condition were perceived by their  as significantly more controlling than mothers in the control condition, regardless of their controlling . Path analyses then showed that coded maternal practices predicted 's perceptions of maternal controlling practices, which in turn were associated with higher levels of controlled motivation in . Examining indirect effects  revealed a significant link from environmental threats to 's controlled motivation, via perceived maternal controlling practices. Contributions of these  to the literature on  are discussed."
Why young people do things for the environment: The role of parenting for adolescents' motivation to engage in pro-environmental behaviour,2017,"It is well documented that s' behaviour and family norms exert a significant influence on young people's pro-environmental attitudes and behaviour. But what is the role of   in this connection? The   addresses this question based on a matched sample of young people aged 18-20 (n = 448) and one  (n = 448), each completing an online questionnaire that included the Motivation Toward the Environment Scale, Perception of  Styles Scale, and questions about perceived (by youth) al and self-reported (by youth and ) pro-environmental behaviours. We find that young people display less internalized motivation to 'do things for the environment' than their s, but that their motivation to act in pro-environmental ways is rooted in family descriptive norms, s' internalized motivation to act pro-environmentally, and the autonomy-supporting   and structure prevalent in the home.

Australian Parenting and Adolescent Boys' and Girls' Academic Performance and Mastery: The Mediating Effect of Perceptions of Parenting and Sense of School Membership,2016,"This  contributes to the understanding of how  relates to adolescents' academic outcomes. This  tested the hypothesis that  behaviours, including al warmth, anger, consistency and self-efficacy, are related to adolescents' academic performance and mastery, and that this relationship is mediated by adolescent boys' and girls' perceptions of  and their sense of school membership in different ways. Multi-group nested structural equation models were built using the data obtained from Wave 5 of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. Four measures of  behaviours, adolescents' perception of  behaviour, adolescents' sense of school membership and their academic performance and mastery were obtained from 1926 boys and 1850 girls and their s to test this 's hypotheses. The path models showed that girls' perceptions of  played a more explicit role in affecting their academic performance and mastery compared to boys. Furthermore,  behaviours were mediated by boys' and girls' sense of school membership, as influenced by their perceptions of , in predicting their mastery and performance orientations, though the effects were quite different. The  suggest the roles played by s in contributing to their 's schooling and academic performance somewhat differ between boys and girls."
The relation of hood abuse and early parenting experiences to current marital quality in a nonclinical sample,1996,"This  examines the relation between adults' reports of the nature of the early  they received, including abuse, and the quality of their marital relationship. This community sample of 159 married women and men experienced relatively low levels of abuse. The regression analyses indicated that for women verbal abuse in hood was predictive of marital conflict, and the caring  they experienced predicted the depth of their marital relationship. For men, the abuse variables did not predict any dimension of their current marital relationship. Of the  variables, overprotection was significantly predictive of conflict in their marriage. No demographic variable-income, education, and number of siblings-predicted any dimension of marital quality for either men or women. Given the skew of the abuse data for this nonclinical sample, log transformations were performed on the data and the regression analyses were reported. One change was noted: that for men, physical abuse and overprotection were equally predictive of marital conflict. The  suggest that abuse and early  experiences are predictive of marital functioning in a nonclinical sample, but that differences exist in the pattern for men and women."
ROLE OF MATERNAL CHILDHOOD TRAUMA ON PARENTING AMONG DEPRESSED MOTHERS OF PSYCHIATRICALLY ILL CHILDREN,2013,"Background Independently, maternal depression and maternal history of hood abuse confer risk for impaired . These associations may be compounded when depressed mothers with histories of hood abuse are faced with the challenge of  offspring who themselves struggle with mental health problems. This  examined the relationships among maternal history of hood abuse, maternal depression, and   in the context of  a psychiatrically ill , with an emphasis on examining maternal emotional abuse and neglect. We hypothesized that maternal hood emotional abuse would be associated with maladaptive  strategies (lower levels of maternal acceptance and higher levels of psychological control), independent of maternal depression severity and other psychosocial risk factors. Method Ninety-five mother- dyads ( ages 7-18) were recruited from  mental health centers where  were receiving treatment for at least one internalizing disorder. Participating mothers met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder. Mothers reported on their own hood abuse histories and  reported on their mothers' . Results Regression analyses demonstrated that maternal hood emotional abuse was associated with  reports of lower maternal acceptance and greater psychological control, controlling for maternal depression severity, and other psychosocial risk factors. Conclusions When treating psychiatrically ill , it is important for a 's clinician to consider mothers' hood abuse histories in addition to their history of depression. These mothers appear to have additional barriers to effective ."
"Student profile Not involved in bullying: description based on gender stereotypes, parenting practices, cognitive-social strategies and food over-intake",2020,"The objective of the  is to identify the characteristics of students who do not participate in bullying episodes (called not involved), in function of gender stereotypes,  ; attitudes and social cognitive strategies and food intake. The  involved 1190 elementary school students, from eleven public schools in the State of Mexico, Mexico. Quantitative , with descriptive  and cross-sectional design. Data were collected from five instruments that measure the  variables: bullying, gender stereotypes,  , social cognitive strategies, food intake. The  identified five types of students (victims of school violence; victims of bullying; bully; double role and not involved), the contrasts for one-way ANOVA of a factor, identified significant differences in the groups with respect to each of the variables studied. It is concluded that students who do not engage in bullying episodes (not involved), have more health habits, more social skills that facilitate adaptation to the social context, without identifying with traditional stereotypes such as traditional feminine and machismo. With regard to , it is identified that they are not educated through ineffective  practices such as abuse. The  of this  describe defining characteristics of students who do not engage in bullying episodes, which will be very useful for the development of prevention and intervention programs."
Effects of Self-Concept on Narcissism: Mediational Role of Perceived Parenting,2021,"An increase in narcissism has been reported by experts over the years. Narcissists bring a lot of negative consequences to themselves and to the people around them. This  investigates that perceived  leads to the development of inflated, unstable self-concept. The inflated self-concept lays the framework for the development of narcissistic traits among individuals; perceived  affects this relationship. A sample of 628 adults was taken from North Cyprus through purposive sampling. Scales for perceived , self-concept, and narcissism were administered. Results showed that the statistically significant variance in the self-concept is explained by perceived . Both mothers and fathers contributed significantly to the development of inflated self-concept. Moreover, multiple linear regression  showed a higher significant variance in narcissistic traits due to self-concept compared with perceived . Mediational tests  showed that high levels of narcissistic traits were indirectly related to self-concept through perceived . The  findings have challenged the notion of onlymothers being responsible for narcissistic traits among their . The    suggest that targeting self-concept in individuals with narcissistic traits may be a good directive for therapeutic interventions."
Parenting in Families of Low Socioeconomic Status: A Review with Implications for Child Welfare Practice,2016,"Families involved in the  welfare system overwhelmingly draw from low socioeconomic (SES) populations. Impoverished  are placed in foster care at disproportionate rates. Addressing this dynamic requires understanding the adaptations low-income families make when  under adversity so that accurate assessments of their needs occur. This article focuses on two aspects of  welfare practice: the evaluation of  capacity and service delivery. It examines, in particular, how well current practices and guidelines, as outlined in the literature, fit with more general  on families and  in low-SES environments and offers suggestions for improving practice. Key Points for the Family Court Community: Families involved in the  welfare system overwhelmingly come from impoverished households. Socioeconomic environments place varying demands on families that lead to differences in   and values according to income level. Current practices and guidelines for  assessments and service delivery need to more fully recognize and address those variations in  values, methods and circumstances."
Understanding confidentiality breach in adolescent mental health sessions: an integrated model of culture and parenting,2021,"Adolescent mental health has become a growing concern. One unique challenge to adolescents' willingness to seek professional mental health support is the concern of confidentiality breach by their s. This concern may carry more weight in collectivistic cultures, such as China. The current  utilized a large  sample (N = 460) recruited from six high schools and attempted to integrate cultural self-construal and   in the context of al attitudes toward mental health professionals and desires to breach confidentiality. al independent self-construal was related to more positive attitudes toward mental health professionals through higher authoritative  and negatively associated with authoritarian . On the other hand, interdependent self-construal was related to less positive attitudes toward mental health professionals via higher authoritarian  and lower authoritative . More positive attitudes toward mental health professionals, in turn, were related to lower desire to breach confidentiality. Permissive  did not play a significant role in this process. The   illustrates the importance of understanding culturally specific factors and al influences in therapeutic practices."
Socioeconomic status and oppositional defiant disorder in preschoolers: parenting practices and executive functioning as mediating variables,2015,"Objectives: To investigate the mediating mechanisms of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) in preschoolers through pathways analysis, considering the family socioeconomic status (SES) as the independent variable and the   and the 's executive functioning (EF) as the mediating factors. Method: The sample included 622 three-year-old  from the general population. Multi-informant reports from s and teachers were analyzed. Results: Structural Equation Modeling showed that the associations between SES, EF,   and ODD levels differed by 's gender: (a) for girls, the association of low SES and high ODD scores was partially mediated by difficulties in EF inhibition, and  practices defined by corporal punishment and inconsistent discipline obtained a quasi-significant indirect effect into the association between SES and ODD; (b) for boys, SES and EF (inhibition and emotional control) had a direct effect on ODD with no mediation. Conclusion: SES seems a good indicator to identify  at high-risk for prevention and intervention programs for ODD. Girls with ODD in families of low SES may particularly benefit from  training practices and training in inhibition control."
"Aggressive behaviour in early elementary school : relations to authoritarian parenting, 's negative emotionality and coping strategies",2010,"This  examined whether authoritarian , 's negative emotionality and negative coping strategies independently or jointly predict 's aggressive behaviour at school. Participants included the teachers and mothers of 185 Hong Kong resident Chinese  (90 girls and 95 boys), aged 6-8. Teachers rated the 's aggressive behaviour at school, and mothers reported how often they adopted an authoritarian   and rated the 's negative emotionality and coping strategies. A model predicting 's aggressive behaviour with maternal authoritarian  and 's negative emotionality affecting 's aggressive behaviour at school through the mediating effect of 's negative coping strategies was examined. Mother's adoption of authoritarian  was not related to their perception of the 's negative emotionality. Neither authoritarian  nor negative emotionality alone predicted 's aggressive behaviour at school. The mediation model was supported.

The Effect of Parenting Practices on the Severity of Gingival Bleeding in Children,2017,"Background: Studies have consistently reported that  practices have an impact on eating  which determine obesity levels in . However, to the best knowledge of the authors, there is no  that evaluates the association of  practices on gingivitis in  using path analysis to evaluate if oral health-related behavior mediates this association. This  aims to test a model of  and family demographic factors that could account for gingivitis in , with a focus on the mediational roles of oral health-related behaviors and oral hygiene status. Methods: Clinical examination of oral hygiene status and gingivitis was conducted using simplified oral hygiene and modified Community Periodontal Indices, respectively, on sixth-grade school  (n = 1,539) of Medak District in Telangana State, India. Children  answered a questionnaire consisting of five closed-ended questions on oral health-related behavior. s responded to queries related to socioeconomic status (SES), family structure, number of , oral health-related behavior, and  practices. Results: Prevalence of gingival bleeding was 92.4%. Power assertion  (reing coercive or controlling  practices) had a negative effect on oral hygiene status (beta = 0.044; P = 0.07), and  had an indirect effect on gingival bleeding (beta = 0.011; P = 0.05). Oral hygiene status was positively associated with the extent of gingival bleeding (beta = 0.24; P = 0.01). Children living in families with lower SES had worse oral hygiene (beta = -0.101; P = 0.01) and gingival bleeding status (beta = -0.024; P = 0.01). Conclusion: Power assertion  had a deleterious effect on the extent of gingival bleeding via a worse oral hygiene status of , but SES was  important for predicting oral hygiene and gingival bleeding."
The effect of teaching negotiation styles to parents of female adolescents on parent- relationship,2020,"Introduction and Objective: Adolescence is one of the important periods of life and transition from hood to adulthood. Prevalence of many psychological problems such as depression, anxiety, and substance use disorder increases during adolescence. Proper communication between s and adolescents is conducive to better physical, mental and social maturity in adolescence. This  tended to determine the effect of teaching negotiation  to s of adolescent girls on - relationship. Methods: This  was a quasi-experimental intervention with pre-test and post-test with control group. The sample was selected using convenience sampling and included 64 s with moderate to poor negotiation skills and their adolescent girls aged 13 to 18 years. The data collection continued from May to August 2019. Data was collected using a demographic questionnaire, Pierre's negotiation  and skills questionnaire and Fine's - relationship survey. Analysis was done using SPSS 20 software and descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA, chi-square, pairwise T and independent T tests. Results: Teaching  negotiation  led to a significant increase in - relationship score for adolescent girls (P<0.0001). The mean score of mother- relationship for adolescent girls before and after the intervention was higher than the father- relationship score, although this improvement was not statistically significant (P>0.05).This means that teaching  negotiation  improves - relationship in both s and there was no significant difference between mother- relationship and father- relationship. Moreover, - relationship score of adolescent girls of intervention group in the mothers and fathers group showed a significant increase (P<0.001). Conclusion: Teaching  negotiation  is effective on - relationship and improves al relationship with adolescent girls. Therefore, teaching negotiation  is recommended for adolescent girls to prevent puberty disorders."
10.1016/j.jaac.2019.05.006Effects of the Mother-Child Education Program on Parenting Stress and Disciplinary Practices Among Refugee and Other Marginalized Communities in Lebanon: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,2020,"Objective: Few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have explored the implementation and impact of early hood  education programs in very fragile contexts and humanitarian settings. We tested the effects of a group-based intervention, the Mother-Child Education Program (MOCEP), on  stress and practices among rwo refugee communities and one other marginalized community in Beirut, Lebanon. Method: A pilot wait-list RCT was conducted to assess the program's impact on maternal,  (average age: 4 years), and dyadic outcomes. A total of 106 mother- dyads were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n = 53) or the wait-list control group (n = 53). Analysis was conducted by modified intention-to-treat and supplemental analyses through multiple imputation of missing post-intervention data. Results: Forty families (38%) withdrew early from the . After completing the program, mothers in the intervention group showed a reduction in their harsh  practices, as indexed by the Disciplinary Style Questionnaire (Cohen's d= -0.76, 95% CI = -1.24, -0.27) and in their level of  stress, as indexed by the  Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF; Cohen's d = -0.90, 95% CI = -1.39, -0.40). Exploratory but underpowered analyses of dyadic interactions revealed reductions in the PSI were associated with a reduction in harsh  after the intervention. However, we did not detect any positive impact on behavioral or emotional outcomes among the . Conclusion: Our analyses suggest that MOCEP had a positive impact on disciplinary practices and  stress in a context of high fragility, but that broader effects on maternal and  outcomes may be dependent on program attendance and the availability of other services. We discuss implications of this pilot  for practice and  of a largely unexplored area of program evaluation."
Consequences of Corporal Punishment Among African Americans: The Importance of Context and Outcome,2013,"Corporal punishment is a controversial practice used by the majority of American s and is especially prevalent among African Americans. Research regarding its consequences has produced mixed  although it is clear that there is a need for considering the context within which corporal punishment is administered. To assess the impact of spanking, we employed an expanded  typology that includes corporal punishment. Longitudinal self-report data from a sample of 683 African American youth (54 % female) were utilized to evaluate the relative impact of the ing eight   on three outcomes: conduct problems, depressive symptoms, and school engagement. Results from Negative Binomial Regression Models indicate that the effect of corporal punishment depends upon the constellation of  behaviors within which it is embedded and upon the type of outcome being considered. While it is never the case that there is any added benefit of adding corporal punishment, it is  the case that using corporal punishment is not always associated with poor outcomes. Overall, however, our findings show that   that include corporal punishment do not produce outcomes as positive as those associated with authoritative ."

Always Aware (Siempre Pendiente): Latina Mothers' Parenting in High-Risk Neighborhoods,2012,"Poor mothers contend with numerous economic and environmental stressors that may severely tax their resources for . This  relied on qualitative interviews with 49 low-income Latina mothers to examine how  practices are used when facing neighborhood poverty and the threat of community violence. Several themes emerged in the interviews regarding mothers' approaches to . First, Latina mothers in our sample relied on three strategies previously identified in the literature: (a) strict monitoring, (b) physical and/or social withdrawal from the neighborhood, and (c) engagement in positive, enriching activities for . In concert with these strategies, these mothers  emphasized the importance of (d) establishing strong - communication as essential to effective  in challenging environments. Furthermore, two overarching, culturally salient al goals were identified: (a) fostering principles of educacion in their  and (b) maintaining astute al awareness (estar pendiente) of 's physical as well as emotional states. Our findings illuminated culturally specific meanings that accompany  practices for low-income Latina mothers and underscored the importance of adapting culturally sensitive interventions for s."
PARENTAL DISCIPLINE AND PARENTS' DESIRE FOR CHILDREN'S SCHOOL SUCCESS,2012,"Purpose - This chapter s a new model for the classification of al discipline  (PDS), constructed in an attempt to understand the relationship between  and 's school success. The model includes six PDSs, based on four criteria: making demands, enforcement, punishment, and responsiveness to 's requests. Methodology - Methodology includes quantitative  based on self-report questionnaire. Finding - The findings indicate that (1) PDS has a crucial effect on a 's academic achievement even after controlling for s' and 's demographic characteristics; (2) The progressive authoritative  has the greatest effect on academic achievement, whereas the punitive  has the smallest effect; and (3) punishment has a negative effect on academic achievement, whereas responsiveness to 's requests has the greatest positive effect. Originality/value - PDS is distinguished from the broader concept   in its reference to the daily behaviors that comprise the exercise of discipline. Practical implications - Awareness of the salience of discipline for improving academic achievement can influence patterns of  in general, and PDS in particular. Social implications - PDS indicates the quality of the education and socialization being transmitted. It has a crucial impact on 's school success that is crucial for occupational and economic success."
"Temperament and parenting predicting anxiety change in cognitive behavioral therapy: The role of mothers, fathers, and ",2013,"Objective: A considerable amount of  with anxiety disorders do not benefit sufficiently from cognitive behavioral treatment. The   examines the predictive role of  temperament,  temperament and   in the context of treatment outcome. Method: Participants were 145  and adolescents (ages 8-18) with DSM-IV-TR anxiety disorders who received a 12-session CBT program and were assessed at pretreatment, posttreatment and three months follow-up. Multiple-regression analyses were used to evaluate the following pretreatment and posttreatment variables as potential predictors of treatment response at follow-up: baseline level of anxiety symptoms,  reported maternal and paternal rearing  (emotional warmth, rejection, and overprotection),  reported  temperament traits (negative affect, effortful control, and extraversion), and mothers' and fathers' self-report temperament traits. Results: More maternal negative affect and less emotional warmth as perceived by the  before treatment were related to less favorable treatment outcome (accounting for 29% of the variance in anxiety at follow-up). Furthermore, maternal negative affect and 's extraversion measured after treatment  predicted anxiety at follow-up (together accounting for 19% of the variance). Paternal temperament and   were unrelated to treatment outcome, as were 's pretreatment temperament traits. Conclusion: The  suggest that tailoring intervention to include strategies to reduce maternal negative affect and promote an emotional warm rearing  may improve treatment outcome.

Overprotective Parenting Mediates the Relationship Between Early Childhood ADHD and Anxiety Symptoms: Evidence From a Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Study,2022,"Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is often comorbid with anxiety disorders in . Both ADHD and anxiety in hood has been linked to overprotective  . In the current  we examine a model wherein early ADHD symptoms predict overprotective , which in turn predicts anxiety symptoms later in hood. In Study 1 we utilize cross-sectional data in 102 / dyads between the ages of 5 and 7 years old and Study 2 extends these findings by examining this same mediation model longitudinally in 376 / dyads who were assessed when  were 3, 6, and 9 years old. Results from both studies supported a mediation model wherein the relationship between  ADHD symptoms and  anxiety symptoms was mediated by al overprotection. This is the first , to our knowledge, to examine overprotective  as a mechanism underlying the heterotypic continuity or sequential comorbidity of ADHD to anxiety symptoms."
"Mothers' Temperament and Personality: Their Relationship to Parenting Behaviors, Locus of Control, and Young Children's Functioning",2016,"There appears to be a lack of construct clarity and a dearth of studies that have examined both mothers' temperament and personality in conjunction with  behaviors when predicting young 's functioning. As a , this  examined these constructs jointly so that a further understanding of how mothers' temperament and personality may work together to predict young 's functioning could be gained. As part of this , 214 diverse mothers with young  who ranged in age from 2- to 6-years rated their own temperament and personality, their  characteristics, and their young 's functioning (i.e., temperament and emotional and behavioral functioning). Based on the findings of hierarchical regression analyses completed in this , both mothers' temperament and personality may be important individual predictors of young 's temperament but may be important joint predictors, along with  behaviors, of young 's behavior problems. Consequently, future  should examine the role that mothers' temperament and personality characteristics may play in conjunction with their  behaviors when trying to understand young 's functioning. These findings will be particularly helpful for professionals providing  interventions to families with young  who have difficult temperament  and/or emotional and behavioral problems."
Parenting styles and their contribution to  personal and social adjustment,2020,"Introduction and objectives: This  analyzes the relationship between al  (indulgent, authoritative, authoritarian, and neglectful) with the short- and long-term pattern of personal and social adjustment in , teenagers and adults. Material and methods: The sample consisted of 2,119 Spanish  (59.2% female), 623 adolescents (12-18 years), 591 young adults (19-35 years), 509 middle-aged adults (36-59 years) and 396 older adults (60 years or more). Families were classified into one of four al typologies (indulgent, authoritative, authoritarian and neglectful) based on their scores in the two main dimensions (acceptance/implication and severity/imposition). Children's personal and social adjustment was measured with family self-concept, self-esteem, aggressiveness, sexist prejudice, and internalization of social values of universalism. Results: The  showed a common short- and long-term pattern between al  and personal and social adjustment. The indulgent  was associated with equal or even better scores on personal and and neglectful al . Conclusions: The findings are discussed considering the relevance of the cultural context in which al socialization occurs.

Women were trained in the Triple P group  reported significantly lower rates of maternal depression, anxiety, stress and  misbehaviours than those in the control group. Iranian mothers reported high satisfaction with this intervention. In conclusion, positive  programme is an effective intervention in several aspects for mothers of  with separation anxiety disorder and their ."
Parent- relations and parenting behaviors with  at the age of 13 and 16: Individuation or detachment?,2006,"According to Individuation Theory, adolescents become more and more autonomous while the level of -adolescent connectedness is constant. However, connectedness is hypothesized to attain a more reciprocal, peer-like quality. These assumptions were tested using a sample of 968 students of ages 13 and 16 The sample was quite reative with respect to the various German school tracks. Besides effects of age on the relationship, corresponding age differences in the levels of authoritative  (affection, behavior control, and psychological autonomy granting) were investigated. At age 16, adolescents claimed more autonomy from s, and s had less knowledge of their offspring's life. The -adolescent connectedness remained fairly constant across age, that is, it did not change towards reciprocity. Older participants experienced less paternal support than younger subjects. With age, al behavior control decreased. Fathers  were less affective with increasing age of participants. The father-adolescent relationship was less close than the mother-adolescent relationship, especially for girls. Furthermore, school track differences were revealed. The  are discussed with respect to Individuation Theory and notions of detachment."
Disciplinary slapping is associated with bullying involvement regardless of warm parenting in early adolescence,2018,"Introduction: Bullying among adolescents can cause depression and suicidality. Identifying the risk factors for bullying in early adolescence, when its prevalence tends to increase, would assist in its prevention. Although certain   are known to be associated with bullying, the association of slapping as a al disciplinary practice with early adolescent bullying is not sufficiently understood. Furthermore, little is known about how warm  modifies this association although slapping and warm  are not mutually exclusive. The aim of this  was to investigate the association of slapping with the experience of early adolescent bullying-categorized in terms of victims, bullies, and bully-victims-while considering how warm  modifies this association. Methods: This  used data from the Tokyo Early Adolescence Survey, a cross-sectional survey of 4478  aged 10 from the general population. Data were collected from both  and their primary  using self-administered questionnaires and face-to-face interviews. Responses from 4326 participants with no missing data were usable for the current analysis (mean age, 10.2 +/- 0.3 years; 53 % boys). Results: Frequent and occasional slapping was associated with increased odds of youth being identified as bullies or bully-victims, even after adjusting for warm . The likelihood of being victims, bullies or bully-victims increased as the frequency of slapping increased. Conclusion: Disciplinary slapping was associated with increased odds of bullying in early adolescence, regardless of whether warm  was  or not."
Development and Validation of the Positive Parenting Schema Inventory (PPSI) to Complement the Young Parenting Inventory (YPI) for Schema Therapy (ST),2020,"The factor structure of an initial item pool of 207 positive  items was investigated (Manila; n = 520, 538) to develop the Positive  Schema Inventory. Single group and multigroup confirmatory factor analyses of the Positive  Schema Inventory showed invariance of the factor structure in six out of the seven levels on two other independent samples (Eastern, Indonesia; n = 366, 383; Western, the United States; n = 204, 214). Good values for reliability were obtained for its seven subscales (50 items) using coefficient omegas (.71 to .95). Evidence of validity based on test content, response processes (item responses to desired inferences), internal structure (exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses), relations to other variables (correlations with other instruments), and consequences of testing (correlations with positive schemas) were demonstrated. A core tenet of schema therapy theory was supported in that recall of past positive  patterns were associated with current levels of positive schemas."
Parenting and conduct problems in : Australian data and psychometric properties of the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire,2003,"A wealth of  has shown links between   and  behaviour, and the development of conduct problems in young . Unfortunately, the most common and well-ed measures of  do not tap specific dimensions of  clearly related to risk for conduct problems in . Recently, the development of the Alabama  Questionnaire (APQ) appears to have overcome this problem. It has several subscales that were designed to correspond to empirically identified aspects of positive and negative   important to conduct problems. The current  evaluated the APQ with a large community sample of 4- to 9-year-old Australian . The  showed good internal consistency, validity, and test-retest reliability for the measure. Means, standard deviations, and proposed cut-off scores are ed. These data indicate the APQ is potentially a useful measure for clinicians and ers working with Australian samples of  with conduct problems and their families."
Bidirectional Relations Between Parenting and Prosocial Behavior for Asian and European-American Emerging Adults,2018,"The current  examined bidirectional relations between  and prosocial behavior for both European- and Asian-American emerging adults. Participants included 297 undergraduate students (M-age = 19.61 at Time 1, 59% European-American) who reported on prosocial behavior toward family members, positive , and negative/controlling  at two time points, 1 year apart. Cross-lagged models supported bidirectional relations between  and prosocial behavior with particular emphasis on the role of the emerging adults' prosocial behavior on subsequent . Also, the bidirectional relations between  and emerging adults' prosocial behavior were different for mothers and fathers. Results varied slightly as a function of ethnicity. Discussion focuses on the implications for understanding the multifaceted nature of prosocial development in emerging adulthood."
"Parenting self-efficacy: Links with maternal depression, infant behaviour and adult attachment",2013,"Background: This  examined predictors of  self-efficacy (PSE) in a sample of first-time mothers during the first year after birth and evaluated the effect of a brief, intensive, mother-infant residential intervention on PSE and infant behaviour. Methods: 83 primiparous women with infants aged 0-12 months admitted to a residential -infant program participated in a structured clinical interview for DSM-IV diagnosis of depressive and anxiety disorders and completed questionnaires assessing psychological distress, adult attachment and hood  experiences. During their residential stay, nurses recorded infant behaviour using 24-hour charts. Results: Results showed PSE to be inversely correlated with maternal depression, maternal anxiety and attachment insecurity. Low levels of al abuse during hood, avoidant attachment, male infant gender and depressive symptom severity were found to predict low PSE. Major depression mediated the relation between attachment insecurity and PSE, but there were no links between PSE and infant behaviour. After the intervention, there was a significant improvement in PSE, with abusive  during hood and depressive symptom severity being predictive of change. Conclusions: This  highlights the links between maternal psychopathology and maternal background factors such as hood  experiences and attachment  in the development of postnatal PSE. Directions for future  are discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
Parenting styles in white-rumped swallows (Tachycineta leucorrhoa) show a trade-off between nest defense and chick feeding,2018,"Studies about personalities in wild animals usually focus on five categories of behavioral traits that do not easily accommodate all aspects of al care, a class of behaviors with direct consequence to reproductive success. al care can vary consistently between individuals and constitute  . Here we investigate the consistency of four behaviors of al care across two breeding seasons of white-rumped swallows Tachycineta leucorrhoa in southern Brazil. These behaviors are a prospection of potential nest-sites, nest defense against predators or conspecifics, and chick feeding. If these first three behaviors are consistent, they can be classified according to the standard categories of personality as exploration, boldness, and aggressiveness, respectively. We find that all behaviors, except exploration, are consistent between individuals in the long term. We  show that, besides individual identity, couple identity is an important component explaining variation in behavior. This pattern can arise if behavior influences pair formation or if behavior is a consequence of a common environment affecting the couple. We show that, depending on the al task, males or females are more consistent, suggesting that sexes are adopting different strategies of al care allocation. We then investigate if there is a trade-off between nest defense and chick feeding. We find that birds that defend more  feed the brood less often and suggest that testosterone might be the mechanism modulating this trade-off. Lastly, we discuss the implications of our  to mate choice and highlight the need for studies linking   to fitness in swallow species."
"Adolescents own perceptions of self-evaluation: Self esteem, self efficacy and life satisfaction",2010,"In this  we analyse the relationships between three variables of self-evaluations, being self esteem, self efficacy and life satisfaction. Moreover, we  the evolution of these three aspects during adolescence paying attention to gender differences. The sample was made up of 2400 teenagers aged between 12 and 17 years old taken from 20 high schools in Western Andalusia. In this  we  analyse the relationship between teenager self evaluation and  . Our  show, on one hand, high correlation between self esteem, self efficacy and life satisfaction, and on the other hand, between teenager self evaluation and  . In fact, al warmth and communication and sense of humor show high correlation with adolescent self evaluation. We  found increasing differences between boys and girls as regards their self esteem, self efficacy and life satisfaction as adolescence progressed. Specifically, little changed was observed in boys, whereas girls' self-evaluation decreased with age."
"Child rearing styles, dental anxiety and disruptive behaviour; an exploratory study",2008,"Aim: This was to explore the relation between 's dental anxiety, their behaviour during treatment and their 's rearing . Also the s' preparation of the  for dental treatment was related to behaviour and al rearing . Methods: The s of 100 , referred to a secondary dental care clinic were asked to fill out the Child Rearing Practices Report (CRPR), the Child Fear Survey Schedule (CFSS) and an additional questionnaire on  preparation prior to dental treatment on behalf of their . Four rearing  were constructed by using the  of the Nurturance and the Restrictiveness domain of the CRPR. Dentists were asked to assess the behaviour of the  during dental familiarisation and dental treatment using the Venham scale. The dentists were unaware of the 's CFSS score. s were not  during actual dental treatment. Results: Each 's dental anxiety was related to their behaviour displayed during dental treatment. Highly anxious  showed more disruptive behaviour than their low anxious counterparts did, especially during familiarisation. al rearing  was neither related to  dental anxiety prior to or to behaviour during dental treatment. s who used a permissive rearing  were less likely to tell their  that the dentist will not hurt them compared with authoritarian s. s with an authoritative rearing  were more convinced that the behaviour of their  could be managed by the dentist than s with a permissive and neglectful rearing . After their 's dental rehabilitation s were less inclined to accompany their  during treatment. Conclusions: Dental anxiety correlated positively with the behaviour displayed during treatment. No relation was found between   and dental anxiety and behaviour during treatment. s showed more confidence in the -dentist dyad after the rehabilitation of their `s teeth."
Dimensions of Parental Rearing Styles in Alcohol Dependent Patients: First Results of the Questionnaire on Parental Attitudes and Rearing Practices (FEPS),2013,"To date no instrument for the assessment of   is available in the German language area that has been validated in patients with addictive disorders. Therefore the aim of this  was the confirmatory evaluation of the factor structure of the Questionnaire on al Attitudes and Rearing Practices (FEPS) in 186 alcohol dependent patients. The model as proposed by the test developers with the 4 factors Care, Autonomy, Low Punishment, and Low Material Reinforcement showed acceptable fit when residual correlations were allowed (mother: chi(2)/df = 1,92, RMSEA = 0,07, TLI = 0,79; father: chi(2)/df = 1,75, RMSEA = 0,07, TLI = 0,82). All factors showed sufficient factor reliabilities as well as good to very good internal consistencies. Factor loadings, discriminations and difficulties of the indicators could be regarded as good, with the exception of 2 items. These  indicate the factorial validity of the FEPS in patients with alcohol dependence."
Parental Beliefs and Behaviors: The Study of Parenting in the Costa Rican Context,2012,"This article provides an analytical review on the issue of , which describes the main local and international  related to two major issues in developmental psychology in the Costa Rican context: the goals and practices of  within Costa Rican culture and the main  that characterize the predominant  of mother-infant interaction. Based on  evidence from the past 30+years,  developed by the author, and from the socio-cultural construct of orientation to interrelatedness and independence, main issues within cultural and cross-cultural studies on the subject are discussed from a perspective of cultural developmental psychology. Based on a review and critique of traditional, theoretical approaches in cross-cultural psychology applied to development, their applicability, scope, and relevance in studies of interaction  and al socialization goals are analyzed. The development of a culturally sensitive approach on developmental psychology is proposed."
How do highly sensitive persons parent their adolescent ? The role of sensory processing sensitivity in parenting practices,2020,"This  examines whether sensory processing sensitivity (SPS) in s is associated with their  practices toward their adolescent  and whether attachment insecurity mediates the associations between SPS and  practices. One hundred twenty-one -adolescent dyads completed self-report questionnaires assessing s' SPS, s' adult attachment, and  practices. Results showed that SPS was positively associated with inconsistency, psychological intrusiveness, and attachment anxiety. Further, attachment anxiety mediated the association between s' SPS and harsh  and partially mediated the association between s' SPS and al psychological intrusiveness. There is very little  on how highly sensitive individuals  their  in general and none regarding the  of high-SPS individuals during challenging developmental periods such as their 's adolescence. Findings suggest that s high in SPS may experience this period as especially stressful and high SPS might contribute to the use of negative . Interventions focused on regulating high-SPS s' stress and on facilitating s in practicing separating their own and their 's emotions could promote their use of more positive  practices."
Parenting Scales: Contributions to the factorial validity of the Portuguese version,2011,"The purpose of this  is to confirm the structural validity of the Questionario de Estilos Educativos ais (QEEP) in a sample of Portuguese adolescents. This instrument is an adaptation of the  Scales to the Portuguese population and intends to evaluate adolescents' perceptions of the rearing  of their s. It is composed of 19 items related with two dimensions: Acceptance (Responsiveness) and Monitoring (Supervision). The sample has comprised 210 boys and 213 girls aged from 12 to 15 years. A two-dimensional model has emerged from confirmatory factorial analysis - Acceptance, similar to the original subscale, and Knowledge, composed by some items from the Monitoring dimension. Internal consistency coefficients are acceptable for  purposes."
Parents' perception of Effective Components of a Parenting Programme for Parents of Adolescents in Hong Kong,2014,"The   investigates participating s' perception of the effectiveness of the components of a  programme aimed at reducing -adolescent conflicts in Hong Kong. Sixty-five s of adolescents completed a four-week  programme of two hours per week. They responded to a questionnaire concerning the usefulness of the components of the programme. After responding to the questionnaire, they were invited to attend a semi-structured interview to express their views on the components of the programme. The  indicates that participants found self-reflection, discussion among participants and listening to facilitators' advice to be the three most important components of the programme. They  benefited from learning communication skills and more about adolescents' development. Nevertheless, the granting of autonomy and conflict resolution skills were not totally acceptable to Chinese s. The   indicates culturally sensitive components of  programmes for Chinese in Hong Kong."
Educational styles of teachers in the context of professional dissatisfaction and overwork,2006,"Based on  of  , the   investigates relations between educational  of teachers and work-related variables. Using multiple regressions, the answers of 348 teachers in the 8(th) to 10(th) grade were analyzed. Teachers who indicated a high degree of warmth and support showed lower levels of overwork, professional dissatisfaction, and dissatisfaction concerning the own professional choice than those with teaching  related of low levels of warmth and support. Teachers characterized by a warmth and support who, at the same time, set and reinforce rules for students, were those who perceived having a high degree of personal influence on the class. Psychological pressure was associated with a high degree of overwork. The  indicate that a teaching  characterized by warmth and support was related to positive work conditions among teachers. Teachers should be trained in a way that they do not react with psychological pressure when confronted with overwork."
Exploring Relations between Beliefs about the Genetic Etiology of Virtue and the Endorsement of Parenting Practices,2021,"SYNOPSISObjective We investigated associations between adults' beliefs about the heritability of virtue and endorsements of the efficacy of specific  .Design.In Studies 1 (N= 405) and 2 (N= 400), beliefs about both the genetic etiology of virtuous characteristics and  were assessed in samples of s and non-s. In Study 3 (N= 775), participants were induced to view virtue as determined by genes or as determined by social factors. Heritability beliefs and authoritarian  endorsements were subsequently measured.Results.Study 1 and Study 2 converged to reveal that tendencies to view characteristics as determined by genes were positively associated with endorsement of authoritarian  . This association occurred independent of individual differences in essentialism and right-wing authoritarianism. Study 3 revealed that exposure to genetic accounts of virtue increased beliefs that virtue is caused by genes, which in turn was positively associated with endorsements of authoritarian  responses to  problem behavior. Exposure to genetic accounts of virtue increased endorsement of authoritarian  among s, but was unrelated to authoritarian  among non-s.Conclusions.These studies suggest that genetic accounts of virtuous characteristics reliably relate to more positive beliefs about harsh and controlling  practices, illuminating an unrecognized cognitive factor associated with authoritarian  endorsement."
Multivariate models of parent-late adolescent gender dyads: The importance of parenting processes in predicting adjustment,2008,"Although -adolescent interactions have been examined, relevant variables have not been integrated into a multivariate model. As a , this  examined a multivariate model of -late adolescent gender dyads in an attempt to capture important predictors in late adolescents' important and unique transition to adulthood. The sample for this  consisted of 151 male and 324 female late adolescents, who reported on their mothers' and fathers'  , their family environment, their mothers' and fathers' expectations for them, the conflict that they experience with their mothers and fathers, and their own adjustment. Overall, the variables had significant relationships with one another. Further, the male-father, male-mother, and female-father structural equation models that were examined suggested that   has an indirect relationship with late adolescents' adjustment through characteristics of the family environment and the conflict that is experienced in families; such findings were not evident for the female-mother model. Thus, the examination of -late adolescent interactions should occur in the context of the gender of s and their late adolescents."
"Parental Response Style to Adolescent Self-Harm: Psychological, Social and Functional Impacts",2021,"Adolescent self-harm is a significant public health issue. We aimed to understand how  stress response  to their 's self-harm affects their wellbeing and functioning and the wider family. Thirty-seven participants in Australia (s; 92% female) completed a mixed methods survey regarding their adolescent 's self-harm. We conducted Pearson zero-order correlations and independent t-tests to examine the impact of  response  on their quality of life, health satisfaction, daily functioning, and mental health. We  used thematic analysis to identify patterns of meaning in the data. Two-thirds of participants reported mental ill health and reduced functional capacity due to their adolescent's self-harm. s with a more adaptive response  to stress had better mental health. Qualitative analyses revealed s experienced sustained feelings of distress and fear, which ed in behavioural reactions including hypervigilance and al mental health symptoms. In the wider family there was a change in dynamics and s reported both functional and social impacts. There is a need to develop psychological support for the adolescent affected and s, to support more adaptive response , and decrease the negative effects and facilitate the wellbeing of the family unit."
"Cross-Lagged Panel Analyses of Child Shyness, Maternal and Paternal Authoritarian Parenting, and Teacher-Child Relationships in Mainland China",2018,"The goal of this  was to explore longitudinal associations among  shyness, harsh maternal and paternal  , and close teacher- relationships in the cultural context of contemporary urban China. Participants were N=1,154 third through seventh-grade students (566 boys, 588 girls; M-age=10.78 years, SD=1.55), recruited from schools in Shanghai, P. R. China. Data were collected at two time-periods over a one-year period using multi-source assessments. Children provided self-reports of shyness, mothers and fathers rated their own harsh , and teachers assessed teacher- relationships. Among the , shyness predicted increased incremental change in harsh  (for both mothers and fathers) and incremental decrease in close teacher- relationships one year later. Results are discussed in terms of the evolving meaning and implications of  shyness in contemporary Chinese culture."
PILOT STUDY: SURVEY TOOLS FOR ASSESSING PARENTING STYLES AND FAMILY CONTRIBUTORS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OBESITY IN ARAB CHILDREN AGES 6 TO 12 YEARS,2015,"Objectives: Our pilot  was conducted to test the reliability of the Caregiver's Feeding Styles Questionnaire (CFSQ) and the Family Nutrition and Physical Activity Assessment (FNPA) in a sample of Arab mothers. Design: Twenty-five Arab mothers completed the CFSQ, FNPA, and the Participant Background Survey for the first administration. After 1-2 weeks, participants completed the CFSQ and the FNPA for the second administration. The two administrations of the surveys allowed for test/retest reliability of the CFSQ and the FNPA and to measure the internal consistency of the two surveys. Results: Pearson's correlation between the first and second administrations or the 19-item scale (demandingness) and the 7-item scale (responsiveness) of the CFSQ were .95 and .86, respectively. As for the FNPA, Pearson's correlation was .80. The estimated reliabilities (Cronbach's alpha) of the CFSQ increased from .86 for the first administration to .93 for the second administration. However, the estimated reliabilities of the FNPA slightly increased from .58 for first administration to .59 for the second administration. Conclusion: In our pilot  of Arab mothers, the CFSQ and FNPA were shown to be promising in terms of reliability and content validity."
Assessment of the parental authority questionnaire-short in Australian and Polish samples,2015,"The al Authority Questionnaire-Short (PAQ-S; Alkharusi, H., Aldhafri, S., Kazem, A., Alzubiadi, A., & Al-Bahrani, M.

The current  assessed the PAQ-S in Australian and Polish samples. The  indicated that the PAQ-S provided poor fitting models in both samples and a lack of measurement invariance. Further analyses identified subsets of 11 items for maternal and paternal   with each providing improved model fit. Reliability for the remaining permissive items however was poor. Future  may thus aim to further revise the measurement of authoritative, authoritarian and permissive ."
Autonomy-Supportive Parenting and Autonomy-Supportive Sibling Interactions: The Role of Mothers' and Siblings' Psychological Need Satisfaction,2015,"Autonomy-supportive  yields manifold benefits. To gain more insight into the family-level dynamics involved in autonomy-supportive , the   addressed three issues. First, on the basis of self-determination theory, we examined whether mothers' satisfaction of the psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness related to autonomy-supportive . Second, we investigated maternal autonomy support as an intervening variable in the mother- similarity in psychological need satisfaction. Third, we examined associations between autonomy-supportive  and autonomy-supportive sibling interactions. Participants were 154 mothers (M age = 39.45, SD = 3.96) and their two elementary school-age  (M age = 8.54, SD = 0.89 and M age = 10.38, SD = 0.87). Although mothers' psychological need satisfaction related only to maternal autonomy support in the younger siblings, autonomy-supportive  related to psychological need satisfaction in both siblings and to an autonomy-supportive interaction  between siblings. We discuss the importance of maternal autonomy support for family-level dynamics."
Family and parental functioning in parents of disabled ,2013,"In accord with the Resiliency Model of Family Stress, Adjustment, and Adaptation and the Global Focus Model, this  investigated family functioning, al stress, and  . Four aspects (energy, focus of attention, experiential modality, and regulation) of - interactions were analyzed. The aim of the  was to explore differences between differently aged s (30-40 vs. 50-60 years) of a  with an intellectual disability and those with a nondisabled . The participants were 32 couples with disabled  and 32 couples with nondisabled . Participants were asked to fill out self-report questionnaires (Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale,  Stress Index-Short Form, and s Preference Test), which were individually ed. The  showed differences in family functioning,  stress, and   in the two types of families with differently aged s. The  confirm the need to better examine family functioning in contexts in which each component inevitably dynamically contributes to ensure a proper fit and to reduce the vulnerability of the family system."
Influence of Parenting Factors on Childhood Social Anxiety: Direct Observation of Parental Warmth and Control,2009,"The purpose of the   is to determine the association of  behaviors and social anxiety in . Three al factors-including al socialization, control, and warmth-were investigated in a sample of 31 two- families. Rather than solely relying upon retrospective questionnaires, this  incorporated direct observation and a Daily Activity Log to assess the qualities of social interaction. Moderate associations between al control and  anxiety symptoms were found, with no support for the association between al warmth and  anxiety. More specifically, maternal overprotection and observed negative commands related to  social anxiety, and paternal overprotection related to  general anxiety. Several gender differences were found regarding the impact of  behaviors on  anxiety. Implications, limitations, and future directions are discussed."
"The Impact of Authoritative, Authoritarian, and Permissive Parenting Styles on Children's Later Mental Health in Japan: Focusing on Parent and Child Gender",2014,"Few studies in Japan have examined whether 's later mental health is influenced by the way al authority is exercised, specifically with a focus on gender. Our main purposes of this  were to confirm the three-factor structure of the Japanese version of the al Authority Questionnaire (PAQ) and to verify its reliability and validity. We then used structural equation modeling to examine whether 's later mental health was influenced by s' authoritative, permissive, and authoritarian . The subcategories included in the Japanese version of the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure were chosen as mental health indices. A total of 1,320 people in Japan, including company employees, university students, and hospital staff members, were asked to recall and evaluate the  they received and to report on their current mental health. Confirmatory factor analyses verified the three-factor structure of the Japanese version of the PAQ, with a reduction in the number of items from the original version. The respondents, regardless of gender, evaluated their mothers as having been more authoritative than their fathers. Concerning the impact of   on respondents' later mental health, both maternal and paternal authoritarian   worsened respondents' later mental health, including symptomatic problems, risk to self and others, life functioning, and psychological well-being. Both maternal and paternal authoritative  had a beneficial impact on respondents' later mental health. Simultaneous analyses of multi-groups demonstrated that the nature of these influences did not vary with respondent gender. We  the above  in detail, and discuss them from psycho-socio-cultural viewpoints."
The effect of parenting pressure on 's internalizing problem behaviors and its mechanism,2021,"BACKGROUND: in the process of raising , s will inevitably have inappropriate measures and behaviors, which will bring greater pressure on the 's psychology and physiology. OBJECTIVE: in the field of 's development,  pressure has always been one of the hotspots of worldwide scholars. In order to further understand the causes of 's psychological problems, the effect of  pressure on 's internalizing problem behaviors and its mechanism are explored. METHODS: based on previous literature, the  pressure and 's internalizing related problems in China are investigated. Based on the characteristic discussion of   in China, the  pressure and internalizing problems of  is deeply analyzed. The sample survey is used to sample the s of kindergarten , and a total of 679 's s are selected. RESULTS: the  show that the s of boys have more serious  pressure than the s of girls. In the process of raising , the mother bears more pressure than the father. For the internalizing problems of , the psychological aggression behavior of s shows a relatively serious effect. There is a certain causal relationship between  pressure and s' strict discipline behavior. Therefore,  pressure is used as an intermediary variable to affect 's internalizing behavior.  pressure does not show a significant correlation with 's internalizing problems, but indirectly affects the generation of 's internalizing behaviors by affecting s' strict discipline behaviors. CONCLUSION: it enriches the investigations on  pressure and 's education in China, and provides a certain theoretical basis for the development of 's mental health."
"Attitudes toward parenting strategies, potential for  abuse, and parental satisfaction of ethnically diverse low-income US mothers",2001,"Among a sample of 176 low-income mothers from 3 ethnic groups in the United States, the authors investigated ethnic differences in attitudes toward preferred  strategies, or ; ethnic differences in the potential for  abuse; and the relationship between  strategies, the potential for  abuse, and al satisfaction. They distributed the Maternal Reactions to Child's Deviant Behavior subscale (K. M. Rickard, W. Graziano, & R. Forehand, 1984), a shortened version of the Child Abuse Potential Inventory (CAPI; J. S. Milner & R. C. Wimberley, 1979), and a al Satisfaction Scale (N. P. Medora, S. M. Wilson, & J. Larson, 1996) to the participants. The  indicated no significant ethnic differences in preferred  . Mothers from all 3 ethnic groups ranked praise and reasoning as the Ist and 2nd preferred  strategies. There were no ethnic differences in the perceived potential for  abuse. al satisfaction was negatively related to 2 of the CAPI subscales-loneliness and Problems. The  strategy reasoning was positively correlated with al satisfaction."
The effects of parenting differences on psychological resilience in adolescent students: The role of gratitude,2021,"Previous studies demonstrated that  differences between fathers and mothers may trigger family conflict, which is a risk factor for failing to develop gratitude and psychological resilience in their offspring. Gratitude has  been shown to be a protective factor for developing psychological resilience. However, little is known about the role of gratitude in  differences and psychological resilience. This  examined the effects of  differences on gratitude and psychological resilience in adolescents and the mediating role of gratitude on the relationship between  differences and psychological resilience. A sample of 1117 Chinese adolescents aged 11-19 years (mean age = 14.32; SD = 1.10) participated in this  and completed measures of , gratitude, and psychological resilience. The  indicated that for the same level of , compared with  consistency on a given  dimension,  differences on that same  dimension had more negative effects on gratitude and psychological resilience in adolescents. The   revealed that gratitude mediated the relationship between  differences and psychological resilience in adolescents. These findings can contribute to a better understanding of the inner mechanism of  differences affecting psychological resilience of adolescents and provide guidance for effectively improving adolescent individual psychological resilience."
Factor structure and psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (APQ) for ,2013,"Background: The Alabama Child  Questionnaire (APQ) is a multi-source and multi-method instrument created to assess the most relevant  practices from a bidirectional perspective. Despite its advantages, the APQ has not been validated with a Spanish population. The objective of this  was to analyse the psychometric properties and factor structure of the APQ,  self-report version, in a community sample of Spanish . Method: The participants were 423 Spanish  (58.9% boys) aged between 8 and 12 years. Results: Exploratory factor analysis suggested a version of the questionnaire that consists of 16 items with a four-factor structure: al Involvement, Positive , Inconsistent Discipline, and Poor Supervision. The internal consistency of the subscales was moderate, except for the father's al Involvement factor, which reached acceptable reliability. Convergent validity with a measure of quality of life was adequate. Gender differences were only found in Poor Supervision, with higher scores in boys than in girls. Conclusions: Overall, these findings provide support for the use of the APQ to measure  practices perceived by Spanish ."
The impact of parenting on  mental health among  of prostituting mothers,2018,"While a growing body of literature documents adverse outcomes among prostituting women, very little  has focused on their  practices or the unique risk factors their  experience. This is of particular interest as majority of prostituting women have , that are vulnerable to experiencing adverse outcomes. Among the general population, the positive impact of effective   on 's mental health has been well-documented; however, there is a paucity of information on the relationship between  practices and mental health outcomes for  of prostituting mothers. The current  examined the  practices of prostituting mothers and their effects on  mental health outcomes utilizing data from a larger randomized clinical trial. Mothers and their  were recruited through a local substance use treatment facility. Results indicated that  of prostituting mothers reported experiencing less al monitoring and worse mental health functioning compared to other . The joint influences of al monitoring and psychological autonomy on 's mental health outcomes were different among these , compared to those of non-prostituting mothers. Specifically, as support for 's psychological autonomy increased, so did 's mental health functioning, but only for those that experienced low to moderate levels of al monitoring. This combination of low monitoring and increased psychological autonomy likely fostered independence and may have allowed these  to distance themselves from potential hazards and avoid experiences of abuse. To our knowledge, this is the first  to quantitatively examine  practices and  mental health outcomes among this population."
Adventure Programs and Diverse Family Styles,2013,"This  focused on the mediating effect of two adventure programs emphasizing relationship establishment between youth on the relationship between family  and levels of intrinsic motivation. Family  is defined as the levels of caring and discipline family members give to their . Because of its connection to interest, autonomy, competence, and relatedness, family  is considered as a variable impacting on levels of motivation participating in experiential-based programs. Findings indicated that during the overall adventure experiences, the high support and high challenge (HSHC) family group showed an enhanced level of relatedness than the low support and low challenge (LSLC) group. In addition, pairwise comparisons indicated differences in competence and relatedness between the HSHC and the LSLC groups in the pretest, but were no longer significant at the posttest. The paired t tests showed that the LSLC group improved on interest, competence, and relatedness throughout the adventure experiences. The findings indicated that the adventure programs offer an environment, which enhance youth participants' perceived interest and psychological needs, especially for youth from the LSLC group."
Associations between Coparenting Quality and Food Parenting Practices among Mothers and Fathers in the Guelph Family Health Study,2021,"Co quality and food  practices have been shown to have a strong influence on  outcomes. However, little is known about whether co quality may influence food  practices. This  aimed to investigate how co quality is associated with both mothers' and fathers' food  practices. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted of 58 mothers and 40 fathers enrolled in the Guelph Family Health Study. The Co Relationship Scale and the Comprehensive Feeding Practices Questionnaire were used to measure co and food  practices, respectively. Linear regressions using generalized estimating equations were used to examine associations between co quality and food  practices in mothers and fathers. Among mothers, higher co quality was associated with lower use of food for emotional regulation, restriction of food for health, and  control of food intake and with higher encouragement of a balanced and varied diet, provision of a healthy home environment, and modeling of healthy eating behaviors. Among fathers, higher co quality was associated with lower pressure to eat and with higher encouragement of a balanced and varied diet and provision of a healthy home environment. Co quality is associated with food  practices among both mothers and fathers. Interventions aiming to improve food  practices should include fathers and should consider targeting s' co relationship."
"Like grandparents, like parents: Empirical evidence and psychoanalytic thinking on the transmission of parenting styles",2018,"The authors discuss the issue of intergenerational transmission of  from an empirical and psychoanalytic perspective. After ing a framework to explain their conception of , they describe intergenerational transmission of  as a key to interpreting and eventually changing  behaviors. Then they  (1) the empirical approach aimed at determining if there is actually a stability across generations that contributes to harsh  and eventually maltreatment and (2) the psychoanalytic thinking that seeks to explain the continuity in terms of reations and clinical phenomena. The authors  discuss the relationship between the attachment and the caregiving systems and hypothesize a common base for the two systems in hood experience. Finally, they propose the psychoanalytic perspective as a fruitful theoretical framework to integrate the evidence for the neurophysiological mediators and moderators of intergenerational transmission. Psychoanalytically informed  can provide clinically relevant insights and hypotheses to be tested."
"Sociomoral reasoning, perceptions of parenting and self-reported delinquency in adolescents",2001,"This  considers the relationships between perceived , sociomoral reasoning, and self-reported delinquency in a sample of high school adolescents. Correlational analysis revealed that moral reasoning was associated with a consistent disciplinary . Self-reported delinquency was positively related to a number of the  variables but negatively correlated with moral reasoning. Separate analysis for males and females showed similar patterns for self-reported delinquency, with the exception that moral reasoning was negatively correlated with attachment and supervision among females. The most significant predictors of delinquency scores were  variables, with moral reasoning  playing a role for males. A factor analysis of the perceived  measure revealed two factors. The first factor reflected a warm, inductive and involved  of  with the second reflecting a   characterized by physical punishment. Self-reported delinquency was negatively significantly associated with Factor 1, and positively related to Factor 2. There were  differences in the self-reported delinquency scores of the top and bottom quartiles of Factor 1 scores. These support the conclusion that a al  that is perceived to be warm, involved and inductive is associated with lower levels of delinquency in adolescence.

The Intergenerational Transmission of Parental Factors that Influence Educational Attainment among Latinxs in the U.S,,"al involvement in education is critical to academic achievement. Mainstream forms of al involvement often dismiss Latinx s' subtle practices. We surveyed 252 Latinxs about their and their s' al communication ,  , school involvement, and academic expectations. Correlations were weak to strong. Respondents reported higher mean scores than their s across all practices except psychological support and authoritarian . Most  variables were significantly associated with participants' academic outcomes. Acculturation moderated the relationship between respondents' s' al pressure and authoritarian   and their own. Results suggest intergenerational transmission of  practices regardless of acculturation."
"An examination of food parenting practices: structure, control and autonomy promotion",2019,"OBJECTIVE: In recent years, ers have been working towards creating a standard conceptual framework of food . To understand how s' reports correspond with the proposed model, the current  examined s' reports of their feeding behaviours in the context of a newly established framework of food . DESIGN: Cross-sectional, with a two-week follow-up for a subset of the sample. Participants completed a quantitative and qualitative survey to assess food . The survey included items from common food  instruments to measure the constructs posited in the framework. Exploratory factor analyses were conducted to ascertain which items related most closely to one another and factors were mapped on to existing constructs. SETTING: Online.Participantss of  aged 2.5-7 years (n 496). Of these, 122 completed a two-week follow-up. RESULTS: Analyses revealed eleven aspects of Structure (monitoring; distraction; family presence; meal/snack schedule; unstructured practices; healthy/unhealthy food availability; food preparation; healthy/unhealthy modelling; rules), ten aspects of Coercive Control (pressure to eat; using food to control emotions; food incentives to eat; food incentives to behave; non-food incentives to eat; restriction for health/weight; covert restriction; clean plate; harsh coercion) and seven aspects of Autonomy Promotion (praise; encouragement; nutrition education;  involvement; negotiation; responsive feeding; repeated offering). Content validity, assessed via s' open-ended explanations of their responses, was high, and test-retest reliability was moderate to high. Structure and Autonomy Promoting food  were highly positively correlated. CONCLUSIONS: In general, s' responses provided support for the model, but suggested some amendments and refinements."
Early styles of interaction in mother-twin infant dyads and maternal mental health,2020,"Transition to hood is considered a critical process for mothers of twins. There are, however, few studies on the subject. This  aims to evaluate the differences between mother-twin infant dyads and mother-singleton infant dyads with regard to maternal depression, anxiety,  stress, and the quality of mother-infant interaction. Mothers of twin infants (N = 40) were compared to mothers of singletons (N = 72). At infant 3 months, maternal depression, anxiety, and  stress were assessed via a questionnaire and  of interaction with the Care-Index. The  indicated that mothers of twins (vs mothers of singletons) had significantly higher state anxiety and higher scores on the Difficult Child Scale of the  Stress Index at infant 3 months. No significant differences between the two groups were found with regard to maternal depression. Mothers of twins had significantly lower sensitivity and were more unresponsive than mothers of singletons. Twin infants had significantly more difficult and compliant behaviours than singleton infants. Assisted reproductive treatment (ART) and prematurity had no effect on any of the examined variables. State anxiety was shown to partially mediate the relationship between twin hood and maternal sensitivity and to completely mediate the relationship between twin hood and infant difficult . Maternal unresponsiveness was shown to be exclusively linked to being the  of twins. The  shows that twin hood has a significant effect on maternal mental health and on the quality of mother-infant interaction and highlights the importance of early prevention programmes for twin s."
"Inpatient Schema Therapy for Nonresponsive Patients With Personality Pathology: Changes in Symptomatic Distress, Schemas, Schema Modes, Coping Styles, Experienced Parenting Styles, and Mental Well-Being",2016,"This  provides an evaluation of group schema therapy (ST) for inpatient treatment of patients with personality pathology who did not respond to previous psychotherapeutic interventions. Forty-two patients were assessed pre- and posttreatment, and 35 patients were evaluated at follow-up 6 months later. The  showed a dropout rate of 35%. Those who dropped out did not differ from those who completed treatment with regard to demographic and clinical variables; the only exception was that those who dropped out showed a lower prevalence of mood disorders. Furthermore, intention-to-treat analyses showed a significant improvement in maladaptive schemas, schema modes, maladaptive coping , mental well-being, and psychological distress after treatment, and these improvements were maintained at follow-up. On the other hand, there was no significant change in experienced   as self-reported by patients. Changes in schemas and schema modes measured from pre- to posttreatment were predictive of general psychological distress at follow-up. Overall, these preliminary findings suggest that positive treatment  can be obtained with group ST-based inpatient treatment for patients who did not respond to previous psychotherapeutic interventions. Moreover, these findings are comparable with treatment  for patients without such a nonresponsive treatment history."
Unintentional Injuries in Preschool Age Children Is There a Correlation With Parenting Style and Parental Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Symptoms,2015,"Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death among .

The  was undertaken in two Western cultures (the United States and Australia) assumed to be similar in socialisation practices and emphases. The moderating effects of  sex and  sex were  examined. s completed questionnaires on   and  temperament. Preschool teachers rated 's aggressive and sociable behaviour. US  were rated higher on both types of aggression by teachers and on sociability, activity, and emotionality by s. Girls were rated as more relationally aggressive and more prosocial than boys, with boys higher on physical aggression. Mothers were more authoritative, with fathers more authoritarian, although the latter was mainly a  obtained from US s. In both the United States and Australia, temperament consistently predicted  sociable and aggressive behaviours, with some evidence of fathers' authoritarian   contributing. The  show the relevance for  and  development of gender, and the importance of culture differences even between two Western and individualist countries."
Grief due to divorce: relationship with attachment style and effects on subjective well-being and co-parenting,2017,"Divorce, like other life transitions,  in a grieving process. This paper analyses the grieving process experienced with divorce in a sample of 185 Spanish divorced s as well as the antecedents and consequences of this situation. No differences were found by gender or custody status. Grief due to divorce is affected by the divorcee's sociocultural context, duration of the marriage, time elapsed since the divorce and attachment . Grief due to divorce predicts the person's adaptation to the divorce, reaction to conflict, forgiveness and subjective well-being (life satisfaction, positive and negative affect), but it does not predict co- or perception of support received from the former spouse. The implication of these  for intervention and working with divorced s is discussed."
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PERCEIVED PARENTING PRACTICES AND WELL-BEING AMONG YOUNG ADULT FEMALES IN TURKEY,2021,"The family in modern Turkey faces a challenge in balancing the traditional collective value system that emphasizes the group over the individual, while  integrating a greater push toward self-expression and autonomy among young adults. Providing autonomy support within the relational bonds of the family res a challenge for the collectivistic oriented family in Turkey. The focus of this  was to examine this problem through an analysis of  practices and their influence on emerging adult well-being in the context of cultural change. A non-random convenience sample of 238 female emerging adults living in Istanbul, Turkey, reported on their mothers' and fathers'  practices and their own psychological well-being. A series of multiple regression analyses explored the predictive strength of  practices. For mothers, the most consistent predictor of participant well-being was autonomy support, while for fathers it was emotional warmth. Participants indicated mothers were more involved and provided more autonomy support than did fathers. al involvement was not significantly related to any well-being measure. Significantly higher optimism and life satisfaction was found for participants identifying as an adult. The  are suggestive of the emergence of a new fathering role in urban middle-SES families. Mother and father warmth scores were not perceived to be different, but father warmth was predictive of well-being, indicating both a transition away from traditional authoritarianism and toward a greater emotionally- democratic  . These novel findings are interpreted as a reflection of a change in fathering related to mothering."
Patterns of Parental Rearing Styles and Child Behaviour Problems among Portuguese School-Aged Children,2009,"The majority of studies investigating the effects of al behaviour on the 's adjustment have a dimensional approach. We identified the existence of various patterns in al rearing  and analysed the relationship between different  patterns and behavioural problems in a group of school-aged . A longitudinal, multi-informant  was conducted. The sample consisted of 519 school-aged  from the Portuguese general population. al rearing  were measured using the EMBU-C, a questionnaire that evaluates 's perception of al rearing dimensions. The assessment of  behavioural problems included the evaluation of internalizing and externalizing problems, and data from multiple reporters (s and teacher). One year later, after a school transition, the adjustment of a sub-sample of 220  was evaluated again. Cluster analysis identified four types of al rearing : low support, supportive-controller, rejecting-controller, and supportive. In both assessment periods, low support and rejecting-controller  patterns showed higher levels of behavioural problems than the supportive and supportive-controller  patterns. These patterns show significant differences between them regarding behavioural problems and have a higher predictive value regarding externalizing problems (versus internalizing problems)."
"Autism, attachment and parenting: A comparison of  with autism spectrum disorder, mental retardation, language disorder, and non-clinical ",2007,"Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have severe and pervasive impairments in the development of social interaction, which may affect the attachment relationship with their s and may have an impact on . In the current investigation 89 families with young  (mean age 26.5 months) were involved, who were diagnosed as ASD, mentally retarded (MR), or language delayed (LD), or part of a non-clinical comparison group. Attachment security was observed with the Brief Attachment Screening Questionnaire, and several al self-report questionnaires assessed the  , al efficacy, al experiences of daily hassles, social support, and psychological problems. Children with ASD were rated as less secure compared to the other clinical and normal comparison groups. s of non-clinical  reported higher levels of authoritative  than s in the ASD group and in the total clinical group, and they  received less social support. s of  with ASD coped remarkably well with the challenges of raising a  with ASD."
Adherence to RIASEC structure in relation to career exploration and parenting style: Longitudinal and idiothetic considerations,2006,"We explored the idiothetic cognitive structure of RIASEC occupational percepts in a sample of Italian middle and high school students over a one year period, examining the possible bidirectional linkages between cognitive-vocational structure, involvement in career exploration activities, and exposure to authoritative  . The focus was on the extent to which individuals' thinking deviates from the normative RIASEC circumplex structure. Results indicated that there was less stability in the occupational percepts of middle school students over time, but both student groups showed change in the direction of greater adherence to circular structure. In addition, deviation from the circular model was related to subsequent career exploration, and initial levels of career exploration and al authoritativeness were predictive of later circular structure, especially in middle school students.

Parenting Behaviors and Anxious Self-Talk in Youth and Parents,2014,"The   examined the association between al anxious self-talk,  behaviors, and youth anxious self-talk. s and youth ages 7 to 14 (M = 10.17; N = 208; 53% male) seeking treatment for anxiety were evaluated for anxiety symptoms, youth anxious self-talk, al anxious self-talk, and youth-perceived  behavior. Youth and al anxious self-talk were assessed by both  and  self-reports; youth-perceived  behaviors were assessed by youth-reports.  behaviors included separate ratings of paternal and maternal (a) acceptance, (b) psychological control, and (c) firm/behavioral control. Correlational analyses revealed that maternal anxious self-talk, but not paternal anxious self-talk, was significantly associated with youth's anxious self-talk. Maternal anxious self-talk had an inverse association with youth-perceived maternal acceptance, but was not associated with youth-perceived maternal psychological or behavioral control. Higher youth-perceived maternal acceptance was significantly associated with lower youth anxious self-talk. Youth-perceived maternal acceptance partially mediated the association between mother's anxious self-talk and youth's anxious self-talk. However, this mediation effect disappeared when taking into account youth depressive symptoms. Results are discussed in relation to clinical implications and future directions in ."

"Parenting stress and competence in borderline personality disorder is associated with mental health, trauma history, attachment and reflective capacity",2020,"Background Individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) may experience additional challenges in their  role, including increased stress and lower self-efficacy and satisfaction. These difficulties have been shown to impact their , and may be implicated in the potential intergenerational transmission of personality vulnerabilities. Methods al stress and competence variables were examined in a cross-sectional  of 284 s (94.72% female, M = 37.37, SD = 8.04 years), of which 69 (24.30%) met caseness for BPD criteria. We completed a multivariate analysis of variance to test how s with 'high BPD features' (meeting caseness for BPD) compared to those with 'low BPD features' on a range of  and mental health variables. Multivariate linear regression modelling was then utilised to explore whether these  variables were associated with personality and psychological wellbeing, recalled trauma history, orientation to attachment relationships and reflective capacity. Results Individuals high in BPD features experienced more stress and lower competence in their  role than those low in BPD features. These s  reported more personality vulnerabilities, poorer psychological wellbeing, recalled more traumatic experiences in their hood, were more likely to endorse insecure attachment  and had poorer reflective capacity. In the regression model,  stress and competence was associated with personality traits, general psychological wellbeing, recalled trauma history, attachment  and reflective capacity variables. al reflective capacity had the strongest association with  stress, satisfaction, efficacy, the perception of having a difficult  and a difficult - relationship, and psychological wellbeing had the greatest association with  distress. Conclusions s who were able to imaginatively enter the subjective world of the  and hold the 's mind in mind with less certainty, reported reduced  stress and greater  satisfaction and efficacy. Helping to improve personality and mental health functioning, increasing al reflective capacity and strengthening - attachment relationships, may reduce  stress and increase  competence in individuals with BPD."
"Risk of Depression in the Offspring of Parents with Depression: The Role of Emotion Regulation, Cognitive Style, Parenting and Life Events",2020,"Children of depressed s are at heightened risk for developing depression, yet relatively little is known about the specific mechanisms responsible. Since preventive interventions for this risk group show small effects which diminish overtime, it is crucial to uncover the key risk factors for depression. This  compared various potential mechanisms in  of depressed (high-risk; n = 74) versus non-depressed (low-risk; n = 37) s and explored mediators of al depression and risk in offspring. A German sample of N = 111 boys and girls aged 8 to 17 years were compared regarding 's (i) symptoms of depression and general psychopathology, (ii) emotion regulation strategies, (iii) attributional , (iv) perceived   and (v) life events. Children in the high-risk group showed significantly more symptoms of depression and general psychopathology, less adaptive emotion regulation strategies, fewer positive life events and fewer positive  strategies in comparison with the low-risk group. Group differences in positive and negative attributional  were small and not statistically significant in a MANOVA test. Maladaptive emotion regulation strategies and negative life events were identified as partial mediators of the association between al depression and 's risk of depression. The  highlights the elevated risk of depression in  of depressed s and provides empirical support for existing models of the mechanisms underlying transmission. Interestingly, the high-risk group was characterised by a lack of protective rather than increased vulnerability factors. These  are crucial for developing more effective preventive interventions for this high-risk population."

Contrary to the suggestions of other investigators, restrictive control related negatively to self-esteem and well-being. Maternal control and paternal warmth emerged as important   variables in relating to adaptation, and exercized their effects on well-being partly through the mediating agency of self-esteem and relationship harmony. This preliminary  provides an empirical investigation of the impact exercized by a culturally specific dimension proposed for Chinese , and highlights the importance of using culturally sensitive measures of adaptation."
Effects of Parenting and Perceived Stress on BMI in African American Adolescents,2021,"Objective This  set out to examine the role of  practices in protecting or exacerbating the negative effects of  and adolescent stress on adolescent body mass index (BMI) over time. Separate longitudinal models were conducted to evaluate how  practices interacted with al perceived stress and adolescent perceived stress in predicting adolescent BMI. Methods Baseline data were collected from 148 African American adolescents (M-age = 12.93, SD = 1.75; Mz-BMI = 0.78, SD = 0.50; MBMI%-ile = 96.7, SD = 3.90) and their caregivers (M-age = 44.45, SD = 8.65; M-BMI = 37.63, SD = 8.21) enrolled in the Families Improving Together for Weight Loss trial. Adolescents self-reported their perceptions of caregiver   and feeding practices. Both caregivers and adolescents self-reported their perceptions of chronic stress. BMI for s and adolescents was assessed objectively at baseline and 16 weeks post-intervention. Results Hierarchical regression models predicting adolescent BMI z-score (z-BMI) indicated a significant interaction between al perceived stress and al pressure to eat. Simple slopes analyses demonstrated that for those s that exhibit higher pressure to eat,  stress was positively associated with adolescent z-BMI. Conclusions These findings provide preliminary support suggesting that certain  practices interact with chronic stress on adolescent weight-related outcomes and that future interventions may consider integrating these factors."
Empathy as a Mediator of the Relationship between Authoritative Parenting and Delinquent Behavior in Adolescence,2021,"The characteristics of authoritative , including high al nurturance and appropriate control, are protective against adolescents' delinquency. However, the mediating psychological mechanisms are not well understood. This three-wave longitudinal  with 704 adolescents (52% males; 76% African American) investigated empathy at age 13 as a mediator of the prospective association between authoritative  ('s disclosure and al nurturance) at age 11 with delinquency at age 18. The  of a structural equation model revealed a significant indirect effect of authoritative  on delinquency through empathy. Authoritative  at age 11 predicted increased empathy at age 13, which then predicted decreased delinquency at age 18. These findings suggest that authoritative  reduces adolescents' delinquency by promoting empathy."

Results. In both women and men, al identity achievement increased from age 36 to 42 and remained stable to 50. The level of al identity achievement was higher in women than in men. Achievement was typical for women and foreclosure for men. Participants' education, occupational status, and number of offspring were not related to al identity status. As expected, al identity achievement was associated with authoritative (indicated by higher nurturance and al knowledge about the 's activities)  . No significant associations emerged between al identity foreclosure and restrictiveness as an indicator of authoritarian  . The diffused men outscored others in al stress. Achieved al identity was related to generativity in both genders and to higher psychological and social well-being in men. Conclusions. At , many  programs are targeted to young s. This  highlighted the importance of a later  phase at around age 40, when for many, the  are approaching puberty. Therefore,  programs and support should  be designed for middle-aged s. Specifically men may need additional support for their active consideration and engagement in the fathering role.

"What Are the Psychosocial Factors Associated With Migraine in the Child? Comorbid Psychiatric Disorders, Family Functioning, Parenting Style, or Mom's Psychiatric Symptoms?",2018,"Objective: Psychiatric diagnoses,  , family functioning among  and adolescents with migraine, and psychiatric symptoms of their mothers were examined. Methods: The K-SADS and other measurements were used to assess psychiatric disorders in 50  with migraine (aged 8-18) and matched 50 controls. Results: At least one psychiatric disorder was diagnosed in 56% of the migraine group. The presence of any psychiatric disorder in  (odds ratio [OR] = 2.765, P = .027) and somatization symptoms in their mothers (OR = 2.061, P = .025) were increasing the risk of migraine diagnosis. The   scale assessments revealed that s in the migraine group grant their  less autonomy. Conclusion: Psychiatric comorbidity, especially depression and anxiety disorders, is more common in  with migraine. The frequency of eating disorder is  higher. Evaluating comorbidity, family functioning, and particularly affective responsiveness in migraine families may guide the clinician to a targeted treatment plan."
SOURCES OF PARENT-ADOLESCENT CONFLICT: CONTENT AND FORM OF PARENTING,2010,"-adolescent conflicts are examined as a function of al rule construction, use of reason at points of disagreement, and regulation of personal, moral, conventional, and prudential social domains. Multiple regression analyses of interviews with mothers, fathers, and adolescents revealed that, across all perspectives, variations in al use of reason explain unique variance in conflict frequency above and beyond rule construction or regulation of domains. Furthermore, based on mothers' reports about their  and adolescents' reports of their mothers, the domains mothers regulate do not explain unique variance in conflict frequency but fathers' reports about their  and adolescents' reports of their fathers do. Differences in s' and adolescents' perspectives are examined and it is concluded that content and form of  are both important in explaining conflict in differential ways between mother-adolescent and father-adolescent dyads."
The Effect of Parenting Patterns and Empathy Behavior on Youth Prosocial,2020,"This  aims to find an effect between  and empathy for adolescent prosocial behavior. The type of  used throughout this  is ex post facto, ers tried to take the effect of the dependent variable and examine it retrospectively to establish causes, relationships, associations, or their meanings. In this , ers cannot manipulate variables. Researchers only describe what happens to independent variables and looks for information about causal relationships from events. There were 60 respondents selected from class VII of Junior High School, which consisted of 30 men and 30 women, aged 13-14 years. The technique of collecting data uses a questionnaire developed by ers. The questionnaire was derived from authoritative  questionnaires, empathy questionnaires, and prosocial behavior questionnaires The technique used in the analysis is multiple regression analysis techniques. The  showed that there was a relationship between authoritative  and empathy together towards prosocial behavior of 25.1%, while 74.9% were determined by other variables. Authoritative  and four positive correlations with adolescent prosocial behavior because  who get attention, discipline, sincere affection from s and family will have good social behavior."
Association of teen mothers' and grandmothers' parenting capacities with  development: A study protocol,2017,"Children born to teen mothers may experience less responsive and supportive  and are at heightened risk for a range of social, developmental, and health issues. There is literature to support the positive impact of grandmothers on teen s and their . However, what if the teen's mother is  limited in her  capacities? How do  capacities across these two generations of mothers affect the developing ? In this ongoing  we are examining two important aspects of  capacities, attachment quality and executive functioning, in teen mothers (TM) and their biological, co-residing mothers or grandmothers (GMor GGM). Both are essential components of effective , but little is known about their impact on young 's development when raised by two generations of s. In a cross-sectional, descriptive design, a convenience sample of 50 TM/GM dyads with  1 to 3 years old is being recruited from two urban teen-tot clinics. Participants complete a paper-and-pencil measure of attachment quality and a computerized measure of multiple aspects of executive function (working memory, inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility). A standardized maternal report measure is used to assess  developmental status. The biggest challenges of the  thus far include recruitment and transience of the  population. Progress to date and experiences from recruitment and data collection are discussed, as well as successful strategies to address challenges."
"Parental Mediation Regarding Children's Pornography Exposure: The Role of Parenting Style, Protection Motivation and Gender",2020,"Communication between  and  regarding pornography can be awkward. In the following , we examined if   (authoritarian, authoritative, or permissive) and gender was associated with al mediation strategies (restrictive, active, and co-use) in relation to pornography exposure, mediated by threat appraisal and coping appraisal (protection motivation theory). A sample of 1,070 Israeli s of 10- to 14-year-old youth completed a set of online questionnaires. Findings suggested that authoritarian and permissive s, who had lower scores in authoritative hood, were more likely to have dysfunctional (i.e., low-quality) communication about pornography and subsequently be less active in their mediation regarding pornography. Conversely, s who were more authoritative were more likely to perceive 1 the severity of pornography consumption and were more restrictive and active in mediating pornography. Finally, fathers tended to have more dysfunctional communication about pornography than mothers and were consequently less active in their mediation strategies concerning pornography."
Intergenerational Continuity and Discontinuity in Harsh Parenting,2012,"The Family Transitions Project began in 1989 to see how rural families in Iowa were coping with the severe economic downturn in agriculture at that time. In this report we show that cohort members who were treated harshly by their s tended to emulate these behaviors with their . However, if they coed with a partner who demonstrated a warm and supportive  , intergenerational continuity was disrupted."
Indonesian Adolescents Experience of Parenting Processes that Positively Impacted Youth Identity,2019,"Javanese culture has particular characteristics in terms of , where s have a higher position than that of their  as a whole. On the other hand, Javanese adolescents are like teenagers in general, where they need freedom of thought and expression during the process of developing adolescent identity. Both of these conditions pose problems for educators and s about how to do appropriate care for Javanese adolescents from the teenager's perspective in order to get a meeting point. Research on the practice of  in Javanese culture about the perspective of adolescents is still very rare. In the  , we aimed to explore the   experienced by Indonesian adolescents in Javanese culture deemed to have a positive effect on the development of adolescent identity from youth perspective based on their experience. We used the philosophy of phenomenology to understand this phenomenon. Data collection was conducted using semi-structured individual interviews of 5 Indonesian teenagers aged between 16-17 years, living with s in the Javanese cultural environment, known to the public as having a good self-identity. We use qualitative analysis to understand subjective experiences, which then form insights about  that have a positive impact on the process of building Javanese teen identity. From the , we found that there are 3 main themes of  which according to adolescents have a positive impact during the process of building their identity, namely (1) The Goals: The existence of clear family education goals; (2) The Values: There are strong values that are instilled since hood; and (3) The Strategy: ways to instill values through fostering culture in the family. In short, our  shows that the development of Indonesian teenagers' identities in Javanese culture is influenced by the values instilled by their s, which they have got since hood, and their development continues to be controlled consistently by their s."
How Residential Schools led to Intergenerational Trauma in the Canadian Indigenous Population to Influence Parenting Styles and Family Structures Over Generations,2020,"This paper intends to address current trauma among the Indigenous Canadian population due to the assimilationist goals of residential schools that influence   and the family structure. Other areas covered in this paper include  issues that the Indigenous community encounters every day. Additionally, social problems are examined in terms of intergenerational trauma and discussed further in terms of their influence and effect on the family structure of Indigenous communities in Canada. For example, education, health inequalities, and intimate partner violence are discussed. These issues are interrelated because of the detrimental and marginalized effect that residential schools have on survivors and generations to follow. Possible solutions to terminating family issues in the Indigenous community are by implementing specific methods that reflect the Indigenous way of life."
"Helicopter Parenting, Autonomy Support, and Student Wellbeing in the United States and South Korea",2020,"Objectives This  sought to examine the relations between helicopter  and autonomy support on the wellbeing of emerging adult  across different countries from Eastern and Western cultures, using the mother- relationship as a mediating mechanism. Methods The participants consisted of 215 American and 171 Korean college students who completed a self-report questionnaire on their mother's  , the mother- relationship, and their mental and physical wellbeing. Multiple group analyses were conducted using the maximum likelihood method, and a bias-corrected bootstrap procedure was utilized to test indirect effects. Results The findings showed an indirect association of autonomy support with student wellbeing through the mother- relationship in both countries. The associations of autonomy support with the mother- relationship and 's wellbeing are positive in both the United States and South Korea, and the effects were similar for students from both countries. However, our  further suggest that, controlling for autonomy support, helicopter  did not uniquely predict the quality of the mother- relationship or students' wellbeing in the United States or South Korea. Conclusions Providing greater autonomy support than helicopter  to  appears to enhance the mother- relationship within the family and 's positive wellbeing in both countries with different cultural backgrounds. This  adds to the extant literature by using the mother- relationship as a mediating variable, expanding the investigation of helicopter  and autonomy support with young adults, and providing a comparative examination of these prevalent yet under-examined  practices between countries with Eastern and Western cultures."
The Influence of Family Context on Identity Processing,2016,"The purpose of this project was to investigate the role of perceived   in the choice of identity processing and commitment among a group of Chinese youth. Examining the identity processing  of 209 young people using the ISI-4 (Smits et al., 2008) and al Authority Questionnaire (PAQ; Buri, 1991), we hypothesised that al  and family socio-economic status would differentially impact the identity commitment of youth in Macao. The findings corroborated Berzonsky's (2004) model, with minor differences, showing a positive relation between authoritative  and informational processing and identity commitment. However, a negative relation between a normative processing  and identity commitment was found in the Chinese sample. Testing for the moderating effect of socioeconomic status showed that authoritative  combined with high SES levels lead to the informational processing ."
Family leadership styles and adolescent dietary and physical activity behaviors: a cross-sectional study,2012,"Background: Transformational leadership is conceptualized as a set of behaviors designed to inspire, energize and motivate others to achieve higher levels of functioning, and is associated with salient health-related outcomes in organizational settings. Given (a) the similarities that exist between leadership within organizational settings and  within families, and (b) the importance of the family environment in the promotion of adolescent health-enhancing behaviors, the purpose of this exploratory  was to examine the cross-sectional relationships between s' transformational leadership behaviors and adolescent dietary and physical activity behaviors. Methods: 857 adolescents (aged 13-15, mean age = 14.70 yrs) completed measures of transformational  behaviors, healthful dietary intake and leisure-time physical activity. Regression analyses were conducted to examine relationships between family transformational leadership and adolescent health outcomes. A further 'extreme group analysis' was conducted by clustering families based on quartile splits. A MANCOVA (controlling for  gender) was conducted to examine differences between families displaying (a) HIGH levels of transformational  (consistent HIGH TP), (b) LOW levels of transformational  (consistent LOW TP), and (c) inconsistent levels of transformational  (inconsistent HIGH-LOW TP). Results: Results revealed that adolescents' perceptions of family transformational  were associated with both healthy dietary intake and physical activity. Adolescents who perceived their families to display the highest levels of transformational  (HIGH TP group) displayed greater healthy eating and physical activity behaviors than adolescents who perceived their families to display the lowest levels of transformational  behaviors (LOW TP group). Adolescents who perceived their families to display inconsistent levels of transformational  behaviors (HIGH-LOW TP group) displayed the same levels of healthy eating behaviors as those adolescents from the LOW TP group. For physical activity behaviors, adolescents who perceived their families to display inconsistent levels of transformational  behaviors (HIGH-LOW TP group) did not differ in terms of physical activity than those in either the HIGH TP or LOW TP group. Conclusions: Family transformational  behaviors were positively associated with both healthful dietary intake and leisure-time physical activity levels amongst adolescents. The findings suggest that transformational leadership theory is a useful framework for understanding the relationship between family leadership behaviors and adolescent health outcomes."
Parental Socialization Profiles in Mexican-Origin Families: Considering Cultural Socialization and General Parenting Practices,2019,"Objectives: Recognizing that immigrant s socialize their  in specific ways, the current  examines Mexican-origin families' al socialization profiles using both al cultural socialization and general  dimensions. We seek to understand how these dimensions interact to form culturally grounded al socialization profiles in a sample of Mexican-origin s and adolescents. Method: There were 604 adolescents, 595 mothers, and 293 fathers within Mexican-origin families self-reporting on 2 cultural socialization dimensions (respeto, independence) and 4 general  dimensions (warmth, hostility, monitoring, reasoning). Adolescent outcomes were assessed 1 year later. Results: Latent profile analysis revealed eight al socialization profiles reing distinct combinations of cultural socialization and  dimensions. Relative to other profiles, the Integrative-Authoritative profile (high on socialization toward respeto and independence; high on warmth, monitoring, and reasoning; and relatively low on hostility) was the most common  pattern and was  associated with more optimal adolescent outcomes. Conclusion: Examining cultural socialization alongside general  dimensions can better capture al socialization strategies among Mexican-origin s. The various al socialization profiles that characterize Mexican-origin s have important implications for adolescent outcomes."
Defining a theoretical framework for information seeking and parenting Concepts and themes from a study with mothers supportive of attachment parenting,2017,"Purpose - Information seeking for - rearing is an increasingly popular topic in the medical and social science literature, though a theoretical framework in which to understand this phenomenon is still missing. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach - The authors   from a qualitative  in which data were obtained from 21 interviews and the personal experience of one of the authors. Participants were all mothers supportive of attachment , a   inspired by attachment theory which advocates making  decisions on a strong basis of information. They were recruited in several Spanish autonomous communities and interviewed between April and July 2015. Findings - Results were analyzed using grounded theory and allowed to define five major themes: becoming a mother implies a new perception of oneself in which it is common to feel more in need for information; the need to search for information originates in situations of conflict or crisis, or as a consequence of conflicting information; information is judged and weighed on the basis of affect and perceptions; scientific and experiential knowledge are valued as complementary; and finally, information seeking appears as one activity of identity work. Originality/value - Placing conflict, instead of uncertainty, at the beginning of the search process allows to emphasize the role of information seeking in mediating relationships and interactions at a societal level. From this point of view, the authors understand that LIS should pay more attention to information seeking as an important factor in social change."
Lifestyle Triple P: a parenting intervention for hood obesity,2012,"Background: Reversing the obesity epidemic requires the development and evaluation of hood obesity intervention programs. Life Triple P is a -focused group program that addresses three topics: nutrition, physical activity, and positive . Australian  has established the efficacy of Life Triple P, which aims to prevent excessive weight gain in overweight and obese . The aim of the current randomized controlled trial is to assess the effectiveness of the Life Triple P intervention when applied to Dutch s of overweight and obese  aged 4-8 years. This effectiveness  is called GO4fit. Methods/Design: s of overweight and obese  are being randomized to either the intervention or the control group. Those assigned to the intervention condition receive the 14-week Life Triple P intervention, in which they learn a range of nutritional, physical activity and positive  strategies. s in the control group receive two brochures, web-based tailored advice, and suggestions for exercises to increase active playing at home. Measurements are taken at baseline, directly after the intervention, and at one year follow-up. Primary outcome measure is the 's body composition, operationalized as BMI z-score, waist circumference, and fat mass (biceps and triceps skinfolds). Secondary outcome measures are 's dietary behavior and physical activity level,  practices, al feeding ,  , al self-efficacy, and body composition of family members (s and siblings). Discussion: Our intervention is characterized by a focus on changing general  , in addition to focusing on changing specific  practices, as obesity interventions typically do. Strengths of the current  are the randomized design, the long-term follow-up, and the broad range of both self-reported and objectively measured outcomes."
Helicopter Parenting: The Effect of an Overbearing Caregiving Style on Peer Attachment and Self-Efficacy,2015,"Helicopter , an observed phenomenon on college campuses, may adversely affect college students. The authors examined how helicopter  is related to self-efficacy and peer relationships among 190 undergraduate students ages 16 to 28 years. Helicopter  was associated with low self-efficacy, alienation from peers, and a lack of trust among peers. Implications are provided for counselors and psychologists in college- and university-based counseling centers to help them to understand and provide assessment and treatment for adult  of helicopter s."
Development and Validation of 18-Item Short Form for the Parents as Social Context Questionnaire,2022,"  have been shown to have direct and indirect influences on , adolescent, and adult psychosocial outcomes. The s as Social Context Questionnaire assesses how well an individual's   provides for their 's psychological needs on six unipolar subscales: warmth, rejection, structure, chaos, autonomy, support, and coercion. The aim of the   was to increase the clinical and  utility of the s as Social Context Questionnaire by: (1) establishing a short form; (2) evaluating the fit of the established short form with the unipolar, six dimensional and the bipolar, three-dimensional frameworks of  ; and (3) assessing the reliability and validity of the established short form. Three-hundred and fifty-one s of a  between the ages of 1 and 12 years were recruited by university students in the United States and completed the current  as part of a larger online survey. First, the number of items per latent factor in the 30-item s as Social Context Questionnaire was reduced. A unipolar, six-dimensional structure with positive and negative higher-order factors demonstrated good fit, while a bipolar, three-dimensional structure did not. Results demonstrated adequate to good internal consistency, convergent validity, and criterion validity. The current  produced preliminary support for an 18-item, unipolar, six-dimensional short form of the s as Social Context Questionnaire (i.e., PASCQ-18), which has the potential to allow for more widespread assessment of   in clinical and  settings by decreasing patient and participant burden and promoting a higher response rate."
"Process evaluation of the Teamplay parenting intervention pilot: implications for recruitment, retention and course refinement",2013,"Background:  programs could provide effective routes to increasing 's physical activity and reducing screen-viewing. Many studies have reported difficulties in recruiting and retaining families in group  interventions. This paper uses qualitative data from the Teamplay feasibility trial to examine s' views on recruitment, attendance and course refinement. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 intervention and 10 control group s of 6-8 year old . Topics discussed with the intervention group included s' views on the recruitment, structure, content and delivery of the course. Topics discussed with the control group included recruitment and randomization. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed and thematically analyzed. Results: Many s in both the intervention and control group reported that they joined the  because they had been thinking about ways to improve their  skills, getting ideas on how to change behavior, or had been actively looking for a  course but with little success in enrolling on one. Both intervention and control group s reported that the initial promotional materials and indicative course topics resonated with their experiences and reed a possible solution to  challenges. Participants reported that the course leaders played an important role in helping them to feel comfortable during the first session, engaging anxious s and putting s at ease. The most commonly reported reason for s returning to the course after an absence was because they wanted to learn new information. The majority of s reported that they formed good relationships with the other s in the group. An empathetic interaction  in which leaders accommodated 's busy lives appeared to impact positively on course attendance. Conclusions: The data ed indicate that a face-to-face recruitment campaign which built trust and emphasized how the program was relevant to families positively affected recruitment in Teamplay. s found the  component of the intervention attractive and, once recruited, attendance was facilitated by enjoyable sessions, empathetic leaders and support from fellow participants. Overall, data suggest that the Teamplay recruitment and retention approaches were successful and with small refinements could be effectively used in a larger trial."
Psychometric Properties of the Chinese Version of the Multidimensional Assessment of Parenting Scale,2021," practices have been linked to a wide range of issues related to 's psychological adjustment; however, more  is warranted to further understand not only cultural variations of  norms, but  how such variations might differentially influence  outcomes. The current  examined the psychometric properties of a Chinese translation of the Multidimensional Assessment of  Scale (MAPS) in order to: (a) assess both positive and negative dimensions of  in Chinese-speaking societies and (b) to explore the association between these practices and 's psychopathological symptoms. A total of 2,237 s with  between 6 and 12 years old completed the MAPS, Interpersonal Mindfulness in  Scale (IM-P), adapted al Bonding Instrument (PBI), and other measures related to 's psychosocial functioning. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) revealed a clear six-factor structure. Strong to strict measurement invariance for  gender,  gender, and  age were found. The  demonstrated adequate psychometric properties in terms of internal consistency and test-retest reliability. MAPS subscales  showed concurrent and convergent validity with mindful , - bonding, and 's psychopathology outcomes. The Chinese version of the MAPS will help facilitate multidimensional   in Chinese-speaking societies and promote future cross-cultural studies examining the effect of positive and negative  on 's psychopathological adjustment."
Feeding Style and a Child's Body Mass Index,2016,"Introduction: Early onset pediatric obesity has become a major health concern in the United States. A key contributing factor to early onset hood is socialization to the eating and mealtime environment. Maternal feeding  play an integral role in how  are socialized to the eating and mealtime environment. Method: The  utilized a descriptive correlational  design. The sample was 126 mother/ dyads recruited from a southeastern Michigan Head Start program. Each mother completed a  packet.

Parenting style influences bullying: a longitudinal study comparing  with and without behavioral problems,2016,"BackgroundMore optimal  has been linked with lower rates of bullying. However, it is not clear whether  can alter the trajectories of bullying among  diagnosed with ADHD or ODD as well as those who are not so diagnosed. This  examined whether  at age 4-5years was associated with changes in bullying over the next 4years among  with Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) with and without comorbid Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) relative to  without these disorders. MethodChildren from the New York metropolitan area (n=162) were prospectively studied over six annual assessment points between preschool and 9years of age.  was assessed by laboratory observations of the  and ; teachers rated  bullying, and s reported on 's diagnostic status (Neither ADHD nor ODD, ADHD but not ODD, both ADHD and ODD). ResultsChildren with comorbid ADHD and ODD were more likely to bully than the other two groups. Hierarchical linear modeling revealed a fall in bullying over five years. Diagnostic status was significantly associated with initial levels of bullying. Irrespective of diagnostic group,  receiving more  support for  autonomy at age 4 to 5years showed a significantly greater decline in bullying than those provided with little support for autonomy. There was no longitudinal link between  negative affect, emotionally supportive  and quality of - interactions with bullying. ConclusionsGreater  support for  autonomy at age 4-5years is related to reduced bullying. Interventions that encourage  support for  autonomy at the time of entry into school may reduce bullying during early school years."
Parenting behaviors and psychological disorders in Colombian adolescents,2017,"This  analyzed the influence of adolescents' perception of  behaviors on externalizing and internalizing disorders. The controlled variables (and their possible effects) were: sex of s and , age, family structure, and the perception of economic problems within the family. The participants were 284 adolescents (156 female and 128 male) ranging between 11 and 19 years of age. Multiple regression analyses  showed that the punitiveness of s was related to internalizing and externalizing disorders, while low monitoring was associated to externalizing disorders only. Withdrawal of paternal affection was related to internalizing disorders. Other predictive variables were the perception of economic problems, sex, and age of  and the existence of a reconstituted family. In non-reconstituted households, the paternal monitoring was related to fewer externalizing disorders and maternal induction with fewer internalizing disorders. The importance of fostering positive  behaviors as well as working with families who are in a process of separation or reconstitution is discussed."
Modifiable Family Factors Among Treatment-Seeking Families of Children With High Body Mass Index: Report of a Pilot Study,2013,"Purpose: The purpose of this pilot  was to explore   and other potential family and social indicators of an obesogenic or weight-promoting family environment. Modifiable factors were sought on which to base a nursing behavioral intervention that could be combined with diet and exercise to reduce youth weight. Methods: Twenty-eight s and their 9- to 18-year-old  who were seeking care for overweight responded to in-home surveys to characterize   (warmth/responsiveness and control). We  examined the extent to which  modeling of health behavior,  feeding practices,  knowledge of nutrition, and family social characteristics differed by the control aspect of  . Results: Nearly all youth and s reported substantial al love (responsiveness), suggesting little variability in the warmth aspect of  . In contrast, considerable variability was found in the control (moderate versus high) aspect of  . Large effect sizes indicated that mothers with moderate control perceived their lifetime weight to be higher, had more concern about their youth's weight (p = .03), had better knowledge of nutrition, and had a lower body mass index (p = .02) than did mothers with high (firm or restrictive) control. Moderate effect sizes indicated that mothers with moderate control demonstrated better modeling behavior, higher perception of youth weight, practiced less pressure to eat, and had youth with lower body mass index and percent body fat than did mothers with high (firm or restrictive) control. Families who volunteered for the  kept their data gathering appointments, but we recommend a recruitment period of more than 4 months and the inclusion of several referral sites. Discussion: Further  of how  control is related to youth overweight and how appropriate control can be achieved among families with teens who are overweight is recommended."
Parenting practices during middle adolescence and high school dropout,2019,"Introduction: Despite inconclusive findings, educational ers have long considered adequate  practices instrumental in preventing high school dropout among adolescents. The  short-term retrospective  focuses on  practices during middle adolescence when dropout typically occurs. Methods: The culturally diverse, high-risk sample of Canadian adolescents (N = 108; M-age = 16.0 years) from low-income neighborhoods included very recent dropouts and matched still-in-school students. A global score reflecting the quality of  practices during the period preceding dropout (or comparable period) was derived from adolescents' answers to a well-established structured interview protocol. Transcripts of interviews were  used to identify the potentially disruptive challenges (e.g., al incarceration) that families faced. Results: Results show a robust relationship between current  practices and dropout that was not moderated by challenging family circumstances or immigration history. Descriptive findings indicate that extreme and relatively rare cases of al neglect were associated with a high dropout risk, but that most dropouts lived in families where communication and supervision, although not entirely absent, were minimal. Conclusion: Offering systematic support to s of middle adolescents could help to prevent dropout in high-risk communities."
Effectiveness of a Preventive Parenting Program Combining Attachment and Behavioral Approaches in an Arab Context: a Cluster-Based Randomized Control Trial,2022," programs aim to help s and carers enhance their skills and ameliorate infants' and toddlers' wellbeing. In Lebanon and other Arab countries, contextualized group-based  programs addressing s' mental wellbeing,  , and  development are quite rare. Therefore, a Preventive  Program consisting of 7 sessions has been designed by local experts for the local cultural context. This  aims to assess its effectiveness. Thirty-three sites were identified in Great Beirut: private firms, primary healthcare centers, and  daycares. Sixteen agreed to take part in the  and were randomly assigned to intervention and control arms. From these clusters, 191 mothers of typically developed  younger than three years were recruited to intervention (106) or control (85) groups. The Mental Health Inventory, Caregiver Knowledge about Child Development Inventory,  Authority Questionnaire, and a Demographic questionnaire were completed at pre-intervention and post-intervention and 3 months later by both groups of mothers. There were no significant differences between clusters with respect to all scales' scores at baseline as well as the 2 other data collection points. Despite the positive feedback collected from mothers who attended the sessions, no significant effects were detected. The design of the program, the expected outcomes, and the characteristics of the participants may have contributed to the limited , hence the need for further ."
PREDICTING SOCIAL-ADJUSTMENT IN MIDDLE CHILDHOOD - THE ROLE OF PRESCHOOL ATTACHMENT SECURITY AND MATERNAL STYLE,1994,"Children's social and emotional adjustment at age 8 were examined in relation to attachment security,  , setting conditions, and social and emotional adjustment at age 4. Seventy-nine  participated in videotaped interaction sessions with their mothers and with unfamiliar peers at the two ages. Data were derived from videotape coding, mother questionnaires, and  sociometric ratings. Results indicted that internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and social engagement were related at the two ages. After removing the variance due to the relationship between  behaviors at the two ages, a comparison of mother- relationship predictors indicated that attachment security at age 4 was the strongest predictor of internalizing problems and social engagement/acceptance at age 8, while maternal  was the strongest predictor of externalizing difficulties. Results point to the importance of both aspects of the mother- relationship, and indicate that the nature of family and peer links may vary depending upon the specific social domain assessed."
Possible antecedents and developmental implications of shame in young girls,2003,"The objectives of this  were to assess the effects of   and  emotionality on the development of proneness to shame in young girls, and the mediating effect of shame on the development of adjustment problems. Eighty-eight girls were assessed twice, at 3 and 5 years of age, along with their mothers and fathers. Shame was assessed by observations (reactions to failure and criticism);   and  emotions (fearfulness, sadness, anger) were measured using  reports; and adjustment problems were assessed by  and teacher reports. Girls were more likely to show shame at age 5 when both their mothers and fathers had been relatively authoritarian at age 3; their emotional dispositions did not have any direct longitudinal effects on shame. Authoritarian  predicted subsequent internalizing problems as assessed by teachers, but there was no evidence for a mediational effect of shame. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd."
Maternal parenting and teaching strategies: relations with 's academic competence,,"We evaluated whether maternal  strategies (maternal achievement-oriented control and maternal monitoring) and maternal teaching strategies are related to 's academic competence in middle hood. We  assessed whether the relations of maternal  strategies with 's academic competence are mediated by maternal teaching strategies. Children (N = 112, 10-13 years old) reported on maternal  strategies and their own academic competence. Mother- dyads participated in an interaction task coded for positive and negative maternal teaching strategies. Results reveal that mothers who use less achievement-oriented control have  with higher academic competence. Mothers who monitor their 's whereabouts more and use fewer negative teaching strategies  tend to have  with higher academic competence.

Development and Validation of a New Questionnaire Assessing Feeding Styles in Toddlers: Toddler Feeding Style Questionnaire (TFSQ),2019,"Purpose: To develop and validate a new questionnaire assessing feeding  in toddlers, the Toddler Feeding Style Questionnaire (TFSQ). Design and methods: An instrumental design was used in this . A convenience sample of 546 Spanish mothers of a toddler (12-24 months-old) completed the TFSQ and a web-based survey to obtain data on feeding , sociodemographic and anthropometric characteristics, weaning and attachment . Items were developed and classified into two content domains: responsiveness and demandingness. For the construct validity analysis, the sample was randomly divided into two halves used to the exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, respectively. Validation hypotheses about the differences in the TFSQ scores were suggested. Results: The factorial analysis revealed a responsiveness scale and a demandingness scale. The McDonald's Omega and Cronbach's alpha values coincided in both scales, being 0.84 and 0.75, respectively. A high responsiveness and demandingness feeding  degree of agreement showed a statistically significant association with the correspondent scale (p < .01). The 33.3% of  who are overweight or obese have mothers who classify themselves as neglectful. Both scales were related to the mothers' attachment , toddler's age and the time of weaning at 6 and 12 months. Conclusions: The TFSQ provides a valid and reliable Responsiveness and Demandingness scale to evaluate feeding  in toddlers. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Individual variability in parenting profiles and predictors of change: Effects of an intervention with disadvantaged mothers,2006,"Four components of a comprehensive, responsive   (Responsiveness to Signals, Maintaining Attentional Focus, Rich Language, and Warmth) have been previously identified [Landry, S. H., Smith, K. E., & Swank, P. R. (in press). Responsive : Establishing early foundations for social, communication and independent problem solving. Developmental Psychology]. In the current , Latent Class Analysis revealed classes (profile groups) of mothers who demonstrated 4 distinct patterns of skills across these  factors. Latent Transition Analysis revealed that mothers randomly assigned to a  intervention were more likely than comparison mothers to transition from weaker to stronger profile groups; e.g., 60% of comparison group mothers who were in the lowest profile group at pre-intervention remained in the lowest profile group at post-intervention, versus 17% of intervention group. Mental health symptoms, social support, and  beliefs individually predicted profile group membership prior to treatment, but only  beliefs predicted pre-intervention profile group membership using a multivariable model. Social support predicted positive change among intervention mothers. Implications include the potential importance of assessing s' initial behavioral profiles and  beliefs to tailor interventions to individual strengths and weaknesses. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The six dimensions of parenting and adolescent psychological adjustment: The mediating role of psychological needs,2019,"In accordance with the Self-determination Theory (SDT), six dimensions of  (autonomy support vs. psychological control, structure vs. chaos, warmth vs. rejection) could be defined in their relation to adolescents' adjustment. However, the mechanisms of these relations need to be further deepened. In accordance with SDT, the aims of this  were: (1) to examine the relationships between the six dimensions of  and the three psychological basic needs; (2) to examine the mediation role of basic psychological needs in the relation between al practices, and positive and negative outcomes in a sample of Italian adolescents. In a sample of 342 adolescents,  suggest that supportive  practice (autonomy support, structure, and warmth) promotes need fulfillment and adjustment, while thwarting  practice (psychological control, chaos, and rejection) reduces need fulfillment and adjustment. Furthermore, the three psychological basic needs (autonomy, competence and relatedness) mediate the relations between  and adolescents' adjustment. These findings highlight the role of  in adolescents' adjustment and in line with SDT provide evidence of the dynamic between , psychological needs and adjustment."

The purpose of the   was to investigate the self-concept of Chinese dyslexic  in primary school, and explore the influence factors of self-concept as well as its relationship with  . A total of 50  with dyslexia and 50 non-dyslexics matched for age, grade and gender participated in the . We used the Piers-Harris 's self-concept scale (PHCSS) and the Chinese version of Egna Minnen Betraffande Uppfostran for Children (EMBU-C) to evaluate the self-concept and   of the  population. Our  indicated that the academic competence, popularity and general self-concept in the dyslexic group were significantly lower than those in the control group (p < 0.05). Based on the multivariate linear regression, we  found that residence (beta = -0.32, p < 0.05) and physical activity (beta = 0.36, p < 0.01) may influence factors self-concept in dyslexic . In addition, a moderate and positive correlation was found between the self-concept of physical appearance and maternal emotional warmth (r = 0.36, p < 0.05) by using the Spearman correlation analysis.

Coping style as a mediator between pregnancy desire and  abuse potential: a brief report,2009,"Women with unwanted pregnancies may be at elevated  abuse risk, although ineffective coping  are associated with both  abuse potential and unwanted pregnancy. The   investigated whether coping  mediated the association between low desire for pregnancy and physical  abuse potential. A sample of 77 expectant mothers participated in an online  . Findings indicated that passive coping , namely cognitive avoidance and emotional discharge, fully mediated the association between low pregnancy desire and greater  abuse potential. The implications of working with expectant mothers with unwanted pregnancies are discussed."
Familial psychosocial risk classes and preschooler body mass index: The moderating effect of caregiver feeding style,2018,"Background: Early  weight gain predicts adolescent and adult obesity, underscoring the need to determine early risk factors affecting weight status and how risk factors might be mitigated. Socioeconomic status, food insecurity, caregiver depressive symptomology, single hood, and dysfunctional  each have been linked to early hood weight status. However, the associations between these risk factors and 's weight status may be moderated by caregiver feeding  (CFS). Examining modifiable factors buffering risk could provide key information to guide early obesity intervention efforts. Methods: This analysis used baseline data from the Growing Healthy project that recruited caregivers/ dyads (N = 626) from Michigan Head Start programs. Caregivers were primarily non-Hispanic white (62%) and African American (30%). After using latent class analysis to identify classes of familial psychosocial risk, CFS was tested as a moderator of the association between familial psychosocial risk class and  body mass index (BMI) z-score. Results: Latent class analysis identified three familial psychosocial risk classes: (1) poor, food insecure and depressed families; (2) poor, single  families; and (3) low risk families. Interactive effects for uninvolved feeding  and risk group indicated that  in poor, food insecure, and depressed families had higher BMI z-scores compared to  in the low risk group. Authoritative feeding  in low risk and poor, food insecure, and depressed families showed lower  BMI z-scores relative to poor, single  families with authoritative feeding . Conclusions: Uninvolved feeding  intensified the risk and an authoritative feeding  muted the risk conferred by living in a poor, food-insecure, and depressed family. Interventions that promote responsive feeding practices could help decrease the associations of familial psychosocial risks with early  weight outcomes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Examining the Validity of the Adapted Alabama Parenting Questionnaire-Parent Global Report Version,2016,"The purpose of the   was to comprehensively examine the validity of an adapted version of the  global report form of the Alabama  Questionnaire (APQ) with respect to its factor structure, relationships with demographic and response  covariates, and differential item functioning (DIF). The APQ was adapted by omitting the corporal punishment and the other discipline items. The sample consisted of 674 Canadian and United States families having a 9- to 12-year-old  and at least 1  figure who had received treatment within the past 5 years for alcohol problems or met criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence. The primary  in each family completed the APQ. The 4-factor CFA model of the 4 published scales used and the 3-factor CFA model of those scales from prior  were rejected. Exploratory structural equation modeling was then used. The final 3-factor model combined the author-defined Involvement and Positive  scales and retained the original Poor Monitoring/Supervision and Inconsistent Discipline scales. However, there were substantial numbers of moderate magnitude cross-loadings and large magnitude residual covariances. Differential item functioning (DIF) was observed for a number of APQ items. Controlling for DIF, response  and demographic variables were related significantly to the factors."
"Parenting, Family Functioning and Anxiety-Disordered Children: Comparisons to Controls, Changes After Family Versus Child CBT",2015,"We examined (1) whether families of clinic-referred anxiety-disordered  are characterized by anxiety-enhancing  and family functioning, compared to control families; (2) whether family cognitive-behavioral therapy (FCBT) for anxiety-disordered  decreases anxiety-enhancing  and family functioning more so than -focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CCBT); (3) whether anxiety-disordered  benefit more from therapy in the long-term when s display less anxiety enhancing  and family functioning. The referred sample consisted of 104 anxiety-disordered  (8-18 year-olds) and their families, randomized to FCBT or CCBT. The control sample consisted of 44 families from the general population. At pretreatment (referred and control sample), posttreatment, 3-months and 1-year follow up (referred sample), 's anxiety disorders were assessed by the ADIS-C/P. Child and s' anxiety symptoms,  behaviors (autonomy granting, overprotection, rejection) and family functioning (relational functioning, family control) were assessed with questionnaires. -reported autonomy granting and family relational functioning were lower in the referred versus control families. Child-reported autonomy granting was higher in the referred families. Anxiety-enhancing /family functioning decreased after FCBT and CCBT, with no differences between treatments. Good family relational functioning at posttreatment predicted more improvement on anxiety measurements at the long term for adolescents, but not for school-aged . The generally hold idea that certain   and family functioning cause  anxiety, and need to be specifically targeted in the treatment of anxious , is not supported. Good relational functioning within adolescent's families however is associated with better long-term outcome on anxiety, suggesting that families can support the maintenance of treatment gains."

Affiliate Stigma in Caregivers of Children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: The Roles of Stress-Coping Orientations and Parental Child-Rearing Styles,2021,"Affiliate stigma may increase the risks of negative  and psychological and depressive problems in caregivers of  with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Evaluating affiliate stigma and determining how to reduce it are crucial to promoting mental health in caregivers and their  with ADHD. The aim of this  was to examine the associations of stress-coping orientations and al -rearing  with the risk of high affiliate stigma in caregivers of  with ADHD in Taiwan. Affiliate stigma, stress-coping orientations, and al -rearing  were assessed. The  of univariate logistic regression analysis indicated that caregivers' gender, depressive symptoms, four orientations of stress coping, and two  , and 's high severities of internalizing, externalizing, and ADHD symptoms were significantly associated with high affiliate stigma. The  of multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that after controlling for caregivers' gender, depressive symptoms, and 's severity of internalizing, externalizing, and ADHD symptoms, caregivers with high orientation of seeking social support were less likely to have high affiliate stigma than those with low orientation of seeking social support; the caregivers with high care and affection  were less likely to have high affiliate stigma than those with low care and affection , whereas the caregivers with high overprotection  were more likely to have high affiliate stigma than those with low overprotection . Intervention programs targeting caregiver affiliate stigma must consider various coping orientations and al -rearing  in their approach."
"Relationships Between Parenting Practices and Preschoolers' Social Skills in African, Indo, and Mixed-Ethnic Families in Trinidad and Tobago The Mediating Role of Ethnic Socialization",2014,"Following the tenets of cultural-ecological theories, this  examined the mediating role of ethnic socialization in the relationship between  practices and prosocial behavior and behavioral difficulties in 1,282 African, Indo- and mixed-ethnic Caribbean female caregivers in Trinidad and Tobago. Across ethnic groups, caregivers used a combination of high levels of positive , rule setting, and material rewards, and moderate levels of harsh discipline and ethnic socialization. Indo and mixed-ethnic Caribbean caregivers engaged in more positive  and rule setting and offered more material rewards to  than African Caribbean caregivers, whereas African and mixed-ethnic Caribbean caregivers used more harsh discipline than Indo Caribbean caregivers. Ethnic socialization mediated the associations between  practices and prosocial behavior in  differently across the three ethnic groups. Harsh discipline had direct associations with antisocial behaviors in all ethnic groups.

Emotion regulation skills in  during the COVID-19 pandemic: Influences on specific parenting and  adjustment,2020,"Child emotion regulation (ER) skills and specific  practices during the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to influence  adjustment in these unprecedented times. On this assumption, we first aimed to examine the predictive value of ER skills in relation to diverse indicators of behavioral and socioemotional adjustment. Then, we tested whether some of these associations could be partially explained through the mediator role of the specific  practices displayed within the pandemic context. These hypotheses were tested considering the previous levels of  reactivity as a potential moderator of the examined relations. Using -reported data from a sample of 874 Galician  (49.6% girls) aged 5 to 9 (M-age = 7.09; SD = 1.04), multiple regression and mediation analyses were conducted. Robust associations between ER skills and diverse indicators of  adjusment were found. Moreover, it was found that specific  practices mediate the relation between  ER skills and specific behavioral outcomes (i.e.,  routine maintenance). Thus, our findings highlight the importance of ER skills for  adjustment during the COVID-19 crisis, not only through direct, but  indirect effects, suggesting that the kind of   that  receive during the pandemic conditions might be partially elicited by their individual characteristics."
Self-Reported Adult Attachment and Observed Parenting Behavior of New Mothers and Fathers,2020,"This  examined associations between s' self-reported adult attachment and observed  behavior using a dyadic and family systemic approach. 182 primiparous expectant couples (182 mothers and 182 fathers) reported on their attachment avoidance and anxiety during the third trimester of pregnancy and were observed interacting with their infants at 3 and 9 months postpartum to assess positive and negative  behavior. Path analyses revealed that fathers had the lowest observed negative  behavior at 3 months postpartum when they were low in anxiety and mothers were  low in anxiety or avoidance. At 9 months postpartum, greater attachment avoidance was associated with lower observed positive  behavior and higher observed negative  behavior regardless of  gender. Moreover, when mothers were more anxious and fathers more avoidant, mothers exhibited greater negative  behavior; when mothers were more avoidant and fathers more anxious, mothers exhibited less positive  behavior."

Parental Attitudinal and Behavioral Change Associated With Prevention-Focused Parenting Education: An Interpretive Description,,"Prevention-focused  education programs (P-FPEPs) provide knowledge and support to s to strengthen - relationships, enhance al and family well-being, and promote healthy  development. The positive impact of such programs on  health and development is well documented. Yet, how P-FPEPs influence s remains unclear. The objective of this  was to explore al perceptions of changes associated with participation in a P-FPEP. We analyzed data using interpretive description with qualitative responses from 459 s who participated in nine different P-FPEPs in a large Canadian city. Participation in a P-FPEP changed s' relationships with themselves, their , their partners, and their community. Participants' relationship with themselves as s changed as they recognized the value of self-care without guilt, gained knowledge of typical  development, and developed greater confidence in their . Positive changes in participants' relationships with their  were facilitated by better understanding the perspective of the , improving communication, feeling more connected to their , and changing  behavior. For many participants, the relationship with their partner improved when they learned about different   and began communicating more openly. Participants' relationships with the larger community were strengthened as they experienced a sense of normalization of their  experiences, developed connections with other s, and learned about community resources. Independent of any specific program curriculum or structure, change associated with P-FPEPs focused on how a shift in understanding and attitudes changed relationships and consequently changed  behavior."
Parenting and adolescent problem behavior: An integrated model with adolescent self-disclosure and perceived parental knowledge as intervening variables,2006,"al monitoring, assessed as (perceived) al knowledge of the 's behavior, has been established as a consistent predictor of problem behavior. However, recent  indicates that al knowledge has more to do with adolescents' self-disclosure than with s' active monitoring. Although these findings may suggest that s exert little influence on adolescents' problem behavior, the authors argue that this conclusion is premature, because self-disclosure may in itself be influenced by s' rearing . This  (a) examined relations between  dimensions and self-disclosure and (b) compared 3 models describing the relations among , self-disclosure, perceived al knowledge, and problem behavior. Results in a sample of 10th- to 12th-grade students, their s, and their peers demonstrated that high responsiveness, high behavioral control, and low psychological control are independent predictors of self-disclosure. In addition, structural equation modeling analyses demonstrated that  is both indirectly (through self-disclosure) and directly associated with perceived al knowledge but is not directly related to problem behavior or affiliation with peers engaging in problem behavior."
Maternal Attachment and Children's Quality of Life: The Mediating Role of Self-compassion and Parenting Stress,2015,"The stress s feel in their  roles and the ways they relate to themselves in difficult or distressing situations, such as with self-compassion, are influenced by their attachment orientations and may account for the well-known association between the quality of s' attachment to their own s and their 's developmental outcomes. We explored the association between self-compassion and  stress and their mediating role in the link between mothers' attachment orientations and 's quality of life (QoL). A total of 171 family dyads composed of a /adolescent aged 8-18 years and the 's mother participated in the . Mothers completed self-report measures of attachment toward their own mother (ECR-RS), self-compassion (SELFCS), and  stress (PSI). The  completed a measure of QoL (KIDSCREEN-10). The current  showed that mothers' attachment to their own mother was indirectly associated with their 's QoL through self-compassion and  stress. Specifically, higher levels of attachment-related anxiety and avoidance among mothers toward their own mother were associated with worse 's QoL through lower levels of mothers' self-compassion and higher levels of  stress. These  reveal an important pathway linking mothers' attachment to their 's QoL and underline the importance of designing  programs aimed at reducing  stress that simultaneously help s to become more compassionate toward themselves."
Perceptions of Parenting and depression-proneness in the Offspring: Dysfunctional attitudes as a mediating mechanism,1998,"This  attempted to clarify the mechanism through which dysfunctional  leads to depression in the offspring. Consistent with theorizing by Beck (1967), we rested a three-stage casual pathway wherein dysfunctional  should give rise to dysfunctional attitudes in the offspring which, in turn, should give? rise to depression-proneness in the offspring Another objective of this  was to further delineate the types of  behaviors that give rise to dysfunctional attitudes in the offspring To this end, a large sample of college students (N = 246) completed measures assessing four  dimensions (i.e., low care, overprotection, perfectionistic expectations, and criticalness) as well as measures assessing dysfunctional attitudes, general depression-proneness, and current depression. Support for the depressogenic effects of all four  dimensions was obtained in that each  dimension correlated significantly with dysfunctional attitudes and depression tendencies in the offspring Moreover; path analyses supported Beck's three-stage casual model with perfectionistic and critical  playing a particularly prominent role. Last, after controlling for current depression, the partial correlations among the variables In the three-stage model remained significant, suggesting that the  findings were not simply the  of a mood congruency effect. These findings illuminate additional  behaviors that can have depressogenic effects and indicate that these  behaviors exert their effects, at least in part, by way of instilling dysfunctional attitudes in the offspring."
Role of mothers' and fathers' Internet parenting for family climate,2019,"Within today's families, there is a growing relevance of 's Internet use as an important and conflictual educational issue, especially during early and middle adolescence. The family climate can be seen as a sensor on how well families handle such Internet-related conflicts. We extended prior  by investigating the role Internet  plays for the perceived family climate of 952 nuclear families using a multiactor design. Moreover, we examined whether families' educational background moderates the expected association between Internet  and family climate. The  confirmed that mothers and fathers with higher  confidence more often co-used the Internet with their , which was found to positively influence the family climate. With regard to the education background, we found that the al co-use of the Internet was a significant mediator, especially for middle- and lower educated fathers. Overall, the findings underline the relevance of - shared Internet activities as a positive resource of family life."

Calibration of the food parenting practice (FPP) item bank: tools for improving the measurement of food parenting practices of parents of 5-12-year-old ,2020,"Purpose There has been a call to improve measurement rigour and standardization of food  practices measures, as well as aligning the measurement of food  practices with the  literature. Drawing from an expert-informed conceptual framework assessing three key domains of food  practices (autonomy promotion, control, and structure), this  combined factor analytic methods with Item Response Modeling (IRM) methodology to psychometrically validate responses to the Food  Practice item bank. Methods A sample of 799 Canadian s of 5-12-year-old  completed the Food  Practice item bank (129 items measuring 17 constructs). The factorial structure of the responses to the item bank was assessed with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), confirmatory bi-factor item analysis, and IRM. Following these analyses, differential Item Functioning (DIF) and Differential Response Functioning (DRF) analyses were then used to test invariance properties by s' sex, income and ethnicity. Finally, the efficiency of the item bank was examined using computerized adaptive testing simulations to identify the items to include in a short form. Results Overall, the expert-informed conceptual framework was predominantly supported by the CFA as it retained the same 17 constructs included in the conceptual framework with the exception of the access/availability and permissive constructs which were respectively renamed covert control and accommodating the  to better reflect the content of the final solution. The bi-factor item analyses and IRM analyses revealed that the solution could be simplified to 11 unidimensional constructs and the full item bank included 86-items (empirical reliability from 0.78 to 0.96, except for 1 construct) and the short form had 48 items. Conclusion Overall the food  practice item bank has excellent psychometric properties. The item bank includes an expanded version and short version to meet various  needs. This  provides more efficient tools for assessing how food  practices influence  dietary behaviours. Next steps are to use the IRM calibrated item bank and draw on computerized adaptive testing methodology to administer the item bank and provide flexibility in item selection."
Parenting and Chinese Adolescent Suicidal Ideation and Suicide Attempts: The Mediating Role of Hopelessness,2016,"Various family factors are risk factors for adolescent suicidality (suicidal ideation and suicide attempts). However, little is known about the role of  in adolescent suicidality. The   examined the unique relations between three  dimensions (al warmth, behavioral control, and psychological control) and adolescent suicidality, as well as the mediating role of adolescent hopelessness among these relations. A total of 1529 Chinese adolescents (52 % male; mean age = 14.74 years, SD = 1.48) completed anonymous questionnaires designed to assess three  dimensions, hopelessness, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. After controlling for gender, age, family structure, and socioeconomic status, it was found that al warmth negatively predicted adolescent suicidality, whereas psychological control positively predicted adolescent suicidality. In addition, al warmth negatively predicted adolescent hopelessness, whereas psychological control positively predicated adolescent hopelessness, which in turn enhanced adolescent suicidality. Although behavioral control did not predict adolescent suicidality, it did negatively predict adolescent hopelessness, which in turn promoted adolescent suicidality. These findings revealed the differential roles of different  dimensions in adolescent suicidality, and the mediation effect of adolescent hopelessness between  and adolescent suicidality. Future practices would benefit from incorporating both  and hopelessness for optimal intervention effect."
Parenting beliefs and academic achievement across African-American and Caucasian family contexts,2012,"The purpose of this  was to examine the role of s' -rearing beliefs in determining the academic achievement of African-American and Caucasian , with a particular emphasis on describing the differential impact of  beliefs across these family contexts. Models were specified in which third-grade academic outcome measures (teacher ratings and standardised assessments) were regressed on a composite variable reing the cumulative  beliefs between infancy and the transition to school, along with demographic controls. Across models, traditional  beliefs uniquely negatively impacted subsequent achievement across ethnicities and there was a moderating impact of ethnicity such that African-American  were more adversely affected by traditional beliefs than were Caucasian . These  suggest that traditional -rearing beliefs re a risk factor for poorer academic achievement for both African-American and Caucasian  and may re an important factor contributing to ethnic-group differences in school achievement."
Soapbox: Class matters in parenting interventions,2016,"Class and income level influence   and values, yet are rarely discussed in treatment approaches and  interventions with families. In this soapbox article, I argue that discrepancies in outcome, retention, and participation could be fruitfully addressed through a fuller understanding of the needs, realities, and  goals of families struggling with financial disadvantage. I compare and contrast ethnographic studies of  in low socioeconomic environments with the types of strategies and interventions commonly advanced in  training programs and suggest that clinicians must become more aware of the cultural and socioeconomic overtones of those interventions in determining whether, how, and when to use them with families."
NURTURE: Development and Pilot Testing of a Novel Parenting Intervention for Mothers with Histories of an Eating Disorder,2014,"ObjectiveTo describe the treatment development and pilot testing of a group  intervention, NURTURE (Networking, Uniting, and Reaching out To Upgrade Relationships and Eating), for mothers with histories of eating disorders. MethodBased on focus group findings, extant , and expert opinion, NURTURE was designed to be delivered weekly over 16 (1.5 h) sessions via an interactive web conferencing forum. It comprises four modules: (1) laying the foundation, (2) general  skills, (3) eating and feeding, and (4) breaking the cycle of risk. Pilot testing was conducted with three groups of 3-6 mothers (N = 13) who had  ages 0-3 years to determine feasibility (e.g., retention), acceptability (e.g., feedback questionnaire responses), and preliminary efficacy. Maternal satisfaction with NURTURE and changes in mother- feeding relationship measures, maternal feeding , maternal self-efficacy, and maternal psychopathology (eating disorder, depression, and anxiety symptoms) across three time points (baseline, post-treatment, 6-month follow-up) were examined. All outcomes were exploratory. ResultsThe intervention was well tolerated with a 100% retention rate. Feedback from mothers was generally positive and indicated that the groups provided an engaging, supportive experience to participants. We observed changes suggestive of improvement in self-reported maternal self-efficacy and competence with . There were no notable changes in measures of maternal feeding  or psychopathology. DiscussionNURTURE is a feasible, acceptable, and potentially valuable intervention for mothers with eating disorder histories. Results of this pilot will inform a larger randomized-controlled intervention to determine efficacy and impact on  outcomes. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. (Int J Eat Disord 2014; 47:1-12)"

Parenting styles and the development of the categorical self: A longitudinal study on mirror self-recognition in Cameroonian Nso and German families,2005,"This prospective  contributes to the understanding of the development of self-conceptions in cultural context. We examined the influence of maternal contingent responsiveness towards their 3-month-old infants on toddlers' self-recognition at the age of 18 to 20 months. We contrasted two samples that can be expected to differ with respect to contingent responsiveness as a  : German middle-class families and Cameroonian Nso farmers. As hypothesized, German mothers reacted more contingently than Nso mothers. Furthermore, German toddlers recognized themselves more often than Nso toddlers. Finally, we found that the level of contingent responsiveness was one of the mechanisms that accounted for mirror self-recognition.

Differential Effects of Mother's and Father's Parenting on Prosocial and Antisocial Behavior: Child Sex Moderating,2017,"The current  examined the differential effects of maternal and paternal  on prosocial and antisocial behavior during middle hood, and the moderating role of  sex. s of 96 boys and 107 girls (mean age = 92.42 months, SD = 3.52) completed different questionnaires to assess  and  behavior. All participants were Caucasian from south of Spain. Multiple hierarchical regressions (enter method) were performed to determine significant predictors of prosocial and antisocial behavior. The  showed that maternal and paternal hostility predicted an increase of externalizing problems in boys and girls (p < .001 in both sex groups). As well, Warmth/Induction of both s predicted an increase in adaptive skills in boys and girls (p < .001 in both sex groups). On the other hand, differential effects of fathers' and mothers'  were found: both for boys and girls, maternal inconsistency positively predicted externalizing problems and negatively adaptive skills (p < .001 in both sex groups) and paternal overprotection positively predicted externalizing problems and negatively adaptive skills (p < .05 in both sex groups). Finally, maternal coercion negatively predicted adaptive skills in boys and girls (p < .05 in both sex groups); however, it increased externalizing problems only in girls (p < .05), whereas maternal permissiveness only increased these problems in boys (p < .01 in both cases). The discussion highlighted the importance of considering both s' and 's sex to further knowledge of   affecting 's behaviors."
Telling a different story: The effect of parenting on the academic and professional achievement of 24 British-Ghanaian high flyers,2015,"Research often highlights concerns about the underachievement of Black students in education and, later, within the labour market. However, shortcomings are identifiable with such . Firstly, achievement levels of all Black students are often homogenised. For example, findings on the achievements of African-Caribbean students are often applied to other Black groups, creating a misleading impression of their different academic outcomes. Secondly, studies seeking to explain low attainment levels of Black students frequently  a pathological picture of Black families in Britain, by assuming that most s use authoritarian approaches to socialising their , which hinders educational outcomes. This  aims to challenge these ideas. It analyses the role of  in the academic and professional success of 24 high-achieving British-Ghanaians. In doing so, it suggests that not all Black/Ghanaian s use authoritarian socialisation methods. However, when s did adopt this approach, it was not necessarily detrimental to 's educational/professional outcomes."
Food Parenting Measurement Issues: Working Group Consensus Report,2013,"Childhood obesity is a growing problem. As more ers become involved in the  of  influences on hood obesity, there appears to be a lack of agreement regarding the most important  constructs of interest, definitions of those constructs, and measurement of those constructs in a consistent manner across studies. This article aims to summarize findings from a working group that convened specifically to discuss measurement issues related to al influences on hood obesity. Six subgroups were formed to address key measurement issues. The conceptualization subgroup proposed to define and distinguish constructs of general  , feeding , and food  practices with the goal of understanding interrelating levels of al influence on  eating behaviors. The observational subgroup identified the need to map constructs for use in coding direct observations and create observational measures that can capture the bidirectional effects of - interactions. The self-regulation subgroup proposed an operational definition of  self-regulation of energy intake and suggested future measures of self-regulation across different stages of development. The translational/community involvement subgroup proposed the involvement of community in the development of surveys so that measures adequately reflect cultural understanding and practices of the community. The qualitative methods subgroup proposed qualitative methods as a way to better understand the breadth of food  practices and motivations for the use of such practices. The longitudinal subgroup stressed the importance of food  measures sensitive to change for use in longitudinal studies. In the creation of new measures, it is important to consider cultural sensitivity and context-specific food  domains. Moderating variables such as  temperament and  food preferences should be considered in models."

For s who had memories of unstable and unhappy hood experiences and who reported low conventionality, higher risk was linked to more power assertion, but there was no such link for those s who recalled happy hood experiences and who embraced conventions. For both s who lacked a sense of optimism and social trust, and for fathers who reported low conventionality, higher risk was linked to less affectively positive , but there was no such link for s who were optimistic and trusting or for fathers who were conventional. Higher risk was linked to more power assertion, but only for mothers low in Extraversion and for fathers high in Neuroticism."

The Mediating Role of Inflated Sense of Self and Impulsivity in the Relationship Between Helicopter Parenting and Psychological Symptoms,2020,"Introduction: Helicopter  is characterised as a   that take too much care and intervention to their , take decisions instead of them, solve the problems they face and try to be overprotective. There is a growing interest in the negative aspects of helicopter . This type of  attitude is thought to affect psychological problems. The aim of this  is to investigate the mediating effect of impulsivity and inflated self-sense of self in the relationship between helicopter  and psychological symptoms. Method: The sample of the  consists of 337 university students. Perceived helicopter  was evaluated by Perceived Helicopter  Attitude Scale, psychological symptoms by Brief Symptom Inventory, impulsivity levels by Barratt Impulsivity Scale, and inflated sense of self levels by using the Inflated Sense of Self Scale. Results: As the helicopter  level perceived from the mother increased, psychological symptoms, impulsivity and inflated sense of self increased. There was no relationship between helicopter  perceived from the father and other variables. In the relationship between mother-perceived helicopter  and psychological symptoms, the inflated self-sense of self and impulsivity have a mediating effect; it was  found that impulsivity has a partial mediating effect on the relationship between inflated sense of self and psychological symptoms. In addition, inflated self-sense of self has a full mediating effect in the relationship between impulsivity and mother-perceived helicopter . Conclusion: The  of the  show that there is a difference between perceived helicopter  from mother and father. Perceived helicopter  is associated with an increase in psychological symptoms. In addition, in this relationship, helicopter  can affect psychological symptoms by causing an increase in impulsivity and inflated sense of self."
Confirmatory and Exploratory Factor Analyses of Parental Authority Questionnaire in Urban India,2013,"The   examined the factor structure of a widely used measure of   in three samples from Northwestern India. College Students (n = 195) completed al Authority Questionnaire (PAQ; Buri in J Pers Assess 57:110-119, 1991), and mothers of  attending high-school (n = 275), and middle-school (n = 145) completed its -report version al Authority Questionnaire-Revised (PAQ-R; Reitman et al. in J Psychopathol Behav Assess 24:119-127, 2002). Preliminary findings revealed that across three samples Cronbach's alpha values ranged from poor to acceptable, with permissive  subscale of the PAQ/PAQ-R having the lowest value, whereas the authoritarian  had the highest value. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that none of the models achieved satisfactory fit (i.e., CFI > .90). Exploratory factor analysis revealed that a two factor structure (with first component consisting of authoritative and permissive items, and the second component consisting of authoritarian items) rendered Cronbach's alpha in the acceptable range. Only PAQ/PAQ-R authoritarian scale was correlated with youth adjustment problems across all three samples, while findings concerning authoritative and permissive scales were mixed. The findings suggest that only PAQ/PAQ-R authoritarian scale is reliable and valid in urban, middle-class, educated families in India, and encourage ers to develop culturally relevant measures of  for this population."

Is there a New Education in Families? Contours of an education of counseling,2019,"Rather than being figured as a declining concept, the concept of family is currently stylised as the highest ideal for the way of living in optimised postmodern societies that are characterised by diversity and social acceleration. The question then arises of how adolescents are brought up in postmodern societies with their open ethical boundaries. The empirical findings of a secondary analysis of a panorama  focusing on 10-18-year-olds illustrate a change in the  of educating this age group. Whereas there used to be a negotiation-based  , the trend is heading towards a more advisory-based al . The   reveals a contrast group, which receives no advisory-based  at all. A   based on advice in postmodern societies includes, among others, intimate communication about the self and the world, an honest interest in the  and in mutual trust, the joint performance of hobbies and competencies and the sharing of insecurities, the organisation of familial leisure time and recognition of the importance of other (pedagogical) adults."
The effects of parenting behavior on prosocial behavior of Chinese adolescents in Hong Kong,2018,"This  explores the interplay between  behavior and prosocial behavior and examines whether  behavior acts as a mediator that explains gender differences in prosocial behavior. We recruited 1988 adolescents (mean age = 14.6 years, SD = 1.8) from 17 secondary schools in Hong Kong. The  showed that  behaviors characterized by care, autonomy, and overprotection had differential positive effects on public, emotional, compliant, anonymous, and altruistic prosocial behaviors, whereas indifferent  had a negative impact on altruistic prosocial behavior. Among  behaviors, autonomy had the most influential positively direct effect on emotional, compliant, anonymous, and altruistic prosocial behaviors. In addition, with mediating effects of gender-differentiated  behaviors, boys were influenced significantly more on emotional and altruistic prosocial behaviors by al overprotection, whereas indifference negatively mediated their altruistic prosocial behavior. These findings provide valuable insights into the multi-dimensional nature of  and prosocial behaviors and partially explain the mechanisms underlying gender differences in adolescents' prosocial behaviors."
Associations Between Individual and Family Level Characteristics and Parenting Practices in Incarcerated African American Fathers,2009,"We investigated the reported  practices of fifty incarcerated African American fathers. Fathers were interviewed using hypothetical vignettes adapted from the  Dimensions Inventory (PDI) and received scores on two  practices: responsive and restrictive. Father's individual level (education and length of time spent incarcerated) and family level (number of relationships that have borne ) characteristics were significantly associated with their  practices. Based on canonical correlation analysis, on function one, responsive  was positively associated with education level and negatively associated with both cumulative incarceration time and more numerous partner fertility. Restrictive  was negatively associated with education level and positively associated with both cumulative incarceration time and more numerous partner fertility. Function 2 capitalized on variance in the restrictive  predictor that was not utilized in function 1, and likely captured lack of opportunity to . On function 2, restrictive  was negatively associated with cumulative time spent incarcerated and more numerous partner fertility. In all,  suggest that prison-based education programs should be part of an overall response to incarcerated fathers. These  add to the growing body of  on incarcerated fathers and fragile families."
Mindful Parenting is Associated with Adolescents' Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Through Adolescents' Psychological Inflexibility and Self-Compassion,2020,"The acquisition and mastery of emotion regulation is one of the most important developmental tasks of adolescence. Difficulties in regulating emotions are one of the most robust risk factors for the development of difficulties and psychopathology. This  investigates whether a mindful   is associated with adolescent's difficulties in emotion regulation and whether adolescents' self-compassion and psychological inflexibility mediate this association. This   explores gender and age differences in  variables and the moderating role of adolescents' gender and stage of adolescence in the mediation model. A total of 375 mother-adolescent dyads participated in the . The adolescents had a mean age of 14.19 years (SD = 1.67; range = 12-19 years) and 59.5% were girls. The mindful  dimensions of compassion for the  and nonjudgmental acceptance of al functioning were indirectly associated with difficulties in emotion regulation through self-compassion, whereas the mindful  dimension of listening with full attention was indirectly associated with difficulties in emotion regulation through psychological inflexibility. Some associations were only significant for girls. These findings suggest that mindful  is a possible vehicle to foster adaptive emotion regulation in adolescents by facilitating their self-compassion and psychological flexibility."
Attachment avoidance moderates the effects of parenting on Chinese adolescents' having an inner compass,2021,"Inner compass (IC) is a schema composed of values, interests and goals that can guide the individual to make life choices that are congruent with their authentic self and basic needs. Past  has shown that having an IC predicts adolescents' optimal functioning, contributing to positive outcomes such as identity formation, resilience against negative peer influences, and well-being. The current  explored the role of s on Chinese adolescents' having an IC. Specifically, we hypothesized that  were more likely to have an IC if their s (1) demonstrated inherent values (IVD) in their behavior to , (2) supported an open exploration and examination of values (SVE) in , and (3) fostered an inner valuing (FIV) in their  based on authentic values and interests, especially when confronted with difficult situations and social pressure. We  hypothesized that attachment avoidance may attenuate the  effects, especially for FIV and SVE, which are more direct al influences. Results supported our hypothesis, showing significant positive effects of all three   on having an IC, and that these effects were weaker when  have high attachment avoidance with s. The current  contributes to the integration of attachment theory and self-determination theory."

We predict that the How-to  Program will promote  mental health by fostering optimal . Methods: In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), the seven-week  group was offered to s of 5-to 12-year-old , in their local grade school. Children's mental health assessments were questionnaire-based (,  and teacher reports) and took place at pre-(T1) and post-(T2) intervention as well as at 6-month (T3) and 1-year (T4) follow-ups. We compared  whose s took part in the program with  whose s did not take part in it until the completion of the trial (i.e., 1 year wait-list control groups). The primary outcome is 's psychological problems (externalizing and internalizing). Secondary outcomes include , the putative mediator of the expected benefits of the program on  mental health, as well as positive indicators of  mental health (strengths and subjective well-being) and s' own mental health. Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first RCT to test the efficacy of the How to talk so kids will listen & listen so kids will talk program in promoting  mental health. In addition to the close correspondence between basic   and the selected program, strengths of this  include its feasibility, monitoring of potentially confounding variables, ecological validity and inclusion of positive indicators of mental health."

A total of 168 Portuguese (44.64% girls, 55.36% boys) and 155 Dutch adolescents (55.68% girls, 44.32% boys) aged 12-17 years old (M = 14.44, SD = 1.65) completed questionnaires about QoL (Kidscreen-27), several dimensions of al  practices, and socio-demographic information. No significant differences were found between countries on general QoL. On the subscale for school environment, scores were higher for Dutch adolescents. Portuguese adolescents reported that their mothers showed more positive , psychological control and behavioral control than did Dutch adolescents. Dutch fathers showed more responsiveness and harsh discipline, whereas Portuguese fathers showed more psychological control.  practices seem to be culturally dependant.  practices, especially positive  and behavioral control, influenced adolescents' QoL regardless of nationality."
Compatibility of the Relationship of Early Recollections and Life Style with Parent Schemas Obtained Through Adlerian Interviews,2016,"In this , the Adlerian Interview Form has been used as a semi-structured, in-depth interview method to identify the experiences of six participants regarding Adler's concepts of early recollections and life . Subsequent to transcribing the obtained information, recollections to be included in the analysis were subjected to the criterion sampling method, and three recollections that met the autobiographical memory qualifications were selected. The selected recollections were investigated through narrative analysis as a qualitative  technique. Structured analysis of the narration in the analysis was carried out using Labov's narrative technique, while the method of thematic analysis was used on the themes.  schemas as perceived by the participants were identified with the Young  Inventory (YPI), and similarities between the perceived schemas and their early recollections and life  were determined within the context of the main themes established during the analyses. Analyses revealed that their early recollections were compatible with their life , and the  roles expressed in their recollection narratives were similar to the schemas identified in the Young  Inventory."

The Multidimensional Assessment of  Scale (MAPS) is a new measure that aims to address gaps in the literature on existing self-report  measures. Research to date on the MAPS includes essential steps of scale development and validation; however, replicating scale dimensionality and examining differential item functioning (DIF) based on  age and a  or  gender is a critical next step. The current  included 1,790 mothers and fathers of sons and daughters, spanning hood to adolescence in the United States. Item response theory (IRT) confirmed initial factor-analytic work revealing positive and negative dimensions; however, the best-fitting multidimensional model included six nested dimensions from the original seven. A few notable items displayed DIF based on  age and  gender; however, DIF based on  gender had minimal impact on the overall score. Future directions, clinical implications, and recommendations are discussed."

To lie or not to lie? The influence of parenting and theory-of-mind understanding on three-year-old 's honesty,2015,"Prior studies have demonstrated that social-cognitive factors such as 's false-belief understanding and   are related to 's lie-telling behaviors. The   aimed to investigate how earlier forms of theory-of-mind understanding contribute to 's lie-telling as well as how  practices are related to 's antisocial lie-telling behaviors (rather than prosocial lie-telling as examined in previous studies). Seventy-three three-year-olds from Hangzhou, P. R. China were asked not to peek at a toy in the experimenter's absence. The majority of  who peeked, lied about it. Children's lies were positively related to performance on the knowledge-ignorance theory-of-mind task. Additionally, Control , characterized by high levels of monitoring and demanding, unquestioning obedience, was negatively related to three-year-olds' lying. The relation between Control  and lie-telling was partially mediated by 's theory-of-mind understanding.

Research findings are inconsistent regarding the distinct influence of mother versus father  on youth suicide intent; moreover, the influence of s' joint   on suicide intent has not been investigated. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design and large sample (N=150 youth, 13-21 years old), currently hospitalized in a treatment center in Egypt for a recent suicide attempt, data were collected using the Suicide Intent Scale, al Bonding Instrument, and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. FINDINGS: Seventy percent of youth reported high suicide intent. Mother and father  , assessed independently, were not associated with adolescent suicide intent. The joint effect of both s'  , however, was positively associated with suicide intent (Wald chi(2)=8.79, p=.03). Suicide intent was stronger among adolescents who experienced neglectful compared with optimal   (B=1.93, Wald chi(2)=4.28, p=.04). CONCLUSIONS: The findings have direct implications for mental health nursing interventions, signaling the critical need to engage both s in family-based interventions to address youth suicidal behavior."
Parenting Plans: Using Research on Child Development and Parenting Styles as a Guide,2011,
"Psychosocial maladjustment in adolescence: Parental socialization, self-esteem, and substance use",2018,"This  analyzes adolescents' vulnerability based on self-esteem and substance use, with   as a protective or risk factor. The sample was composed of 1445 Spanish adolescents (59.4% females), 600 early (41.5%, from 12 to 15 years old) and 845 late (58.5%, from 16 to 17 years old) adolescents. Families were classified in one of four typologies: Indulgent, authoritative, authoritarian, and neglectful. Adolescents' adjustment was captured through self-esteem (emotional, family, and physical) and substance use (alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and synthetic drugs). Results showed that vulnerability was greater in late adolescence than in early adolescence. An interaction was found between the adolescent stage and gender. Male late adolescents had higher substance use of cannabis and synthetic drugs. The lowest emotional self-esteem corresponded to female late adolescents, and the lowest family self-esteem corresponded to male late adolescents. The   did not interact with the stage of adolescence or gender. The indulgent   was associated with equal or even greater protection than the authoritative   against psychosocial maladjustment problems in adolescence, whereas the authoritarian and neglectful   acted as risk factors."
Bullied by Siblings and Peers: The Role of Rejecting/Neglecting Parenting and Friendship Quality Among Korean Children,2019,"The primary aim of this  was to examine the direct and indirect links of rejecting/neglecting , sibling victimization, and friendship quality with peer victimization using a convenience sample of 584 Korean  in Grades 3 to 6. In addition, we tested whether these associations differed between male and female students. Structural equation modeling was performed to analyze the data. The  revealed rejecting/neglecting  indirectly influenced peer victimization through sibling victimization for both males and females, although such effects were stronger for females than males. Sibling victimization had a direct effect on peer victimization across both sexes, although it indirectly influenced peer victimization through poor friendship quality only for males. Therefore, bullying prevention and intervention programs must involve s to make them aware of the important role they play in this process and to improve their   and involvement in sibling conflicts. Furthermore, while the role of friendship quality needs to be highlighted to prevent peer victimization among males, future  continues to explore other peer variables that are related to decreased peer victimization for females."
Mothers' Attachment Style as a Predictor of Breastfeeding and Room-Sharing Practices,2020,"Objective To prospectively assess breastfeeding and room-sharing practices during the infant's first 6 months and investigate whether mothers' own adult attachment  predicts the initiation and course of these recommended  behaviors. Method This  included 193 mother-infant dyads living in the Netherlands. Diary methodology was used to generate 27 weekly measures of breastfeeding and room-sharing during the infant's first 6 months. Multilevel mixed effects models were used to examine trajectories of breastfeeding and room-sharing and to test whether mothers' own adult attachment  predicted the initiation and course of these behaviors, adjusting for covariates. Results Most (86%) mothers initiated breastfeeding immediately after birth and the rates of breastfeeding declined steadily over the 6 months (b = -2.47, SE = 0.19, p < .001). Mothers with higher attachment avoidance showed faster decreases in breastfeeding than less avoidant mothers (b = -1.07, SE = 0.21, p < .001). Sixty-four percent of mothers engaged in room-sharing after birth which  decreased steadily over the 6 months (b = -3.51, SE = 0.21, p < .001). Mothers' attachment  did not predict the initiation or course of room-sharing. Conclusions Given the major implications of breastfeeding and room-sharing for infants' health, safety, and development, the pediatrics community has issued clear guidelines encouraging these behaviors. Yet many new s do not adhere to the recommended practices. This  identifies mothers' adult attachment  as a predictor of breastfeeding over time that could be incorporated into interventions for s."
Parenting Dimensions and Adolescent Peer Aggression: A Gendered Analysis,2020,"The   had two main goals. The first was to analyze the differences between  dimensions-strictness/imposition and involvement/acceptance-in adolescents' engagement in peer aggression as aggressors, victims, aggressive victims, and non-involved. The second goal was to examine differences between  dimensions and peer-aggression roles by gender of both s and adolescents. Participants were 779 adolescents (49.16% boys and 50.84% girls), aged between 12 and 16 years old (M= 14.21;SD= 1.35), enrolled in schools in Andalusia (Spain). Findings showed significant differences in  dimensions depending on gender of both adolescents (boy or girl) and s (mother and father). For sons, non-involved adolescents scored higher in mother and father involvement than aggressors and aggressive victims. For daughters, non-involved scored higher in mother involvement than aggressors. Furthermore, girl aggressors and aggressive victims reported higher levels of mother imposition than non-involved. Results and their implications for sustainable development in adolescence are discussed."
"Structure, coercive control, and autonomy promotion: A comparison of fathers' and mothers' food parenting strategies",2019,"This  explored differences in mothers' and fathers' food  strategies, specifically coercive control, structure, and autonomy promotion, and whether   and al responsibility for food  related to the use of these strategies. s of  aged 2.5-7.5 years (N = 497) reported about their  practices and food  strategies.   accounted for the majority of the variance in food . Fathers were more authoritarian than mothers. Authoritarian and permissive  practices were related to more coercive strategies. Mothers reported more food  responsibility. Responsibility was related to less coercive practices and more autonomy promotion and structure."
Emotional intelligence: impact on post-secondary academic achievement,2016,"This  examined the simultaneous influences of emotional intelligence, adjustment to university, authoritative versus other  , and high school average on first year university students' grade point average (GPA) via structural equation modeling. The participants were 299 first year students from the social science faculty at Laurentian University, Canada. The sample was comprised of 86 males (28.7 %) and 213 females (71 %); most students (96.7 %) were between the ages of 17 and 23. The  showed that high school average had a direct influence on first year university GPA. Emotional Intelligence was not directly associated with first year university GPA, but it was significantly associated with adjustment to university which in turn was significantly associated with the first year GPA. This tends to suggest that the influence of emotional intelligence on academic achievement may be mediated by adjustment to university. Furthermore,   (authoritative versus other) had a significant influence on adjustment to university but not on emotional intelligence and university GPA. Students who came from families with authoritative   tended to be better adjusted than students who came from families with other   (authoritarian and permissive). Problem behaviors such as alcohol use, academic dishonesty and academic procrastination were found to have a negative influence on university GPA and adjustment to university. In conclusion, emotional intelligence and an authoritative   are influential in enhancing adjustment to university which in turns affects academic achievement in university."
"Food preferences, personality and parental rearing styles: analysis of factors influencing health of left-behind ",2016,"To understand the health status and problems of left-behind  (LBC) in rural China, those whose s have moved to urban areas without them, and to focus on ways to improve their physical and mental health. The  examined 827  between 7 and 15 years old, selected using stratified cluster random sampling from five towns in Xiji County of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. Each  was classified as either LBC or non-LBC. Measures included age- and sex-specific height and body mass index (kg/m(2)), a food preference questionnaire, the Revised Junior Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, and the Egna Minnen av Barndoms Uppfostran-My Memories of Upbringing (EMBU). Malnutrition rates for LBC and non-LBC were 14.83 % (70/472) and 7.04 % (25/355) (chi (2) = 11.86, p < 0.01). More LBC reported hating vegetables and fruits. Eysenck Personality Questionnaire profiles of LBC revealed a significantly higher degree of neuroticism and psychoticism, and a significantly lower lie scale score (p < 0.01). LBC's EMBU profiles showed that the paternal approach lacked emotional warmth and understanding and the maternal approach was characterized by favoritism, over-interference and overprotection. There were a significant negative correlation between the personality characteristic of neuroticism and liking vegetables and fruits (p < 0.01), and a negative correlation between psychoticism and liking vegetables (p < 0.05). The health status of LBC is problematic. Food preferences, personality type and   should be taken into account when measures are developed to improve the health of these ."
DO PARENTAL STYLES AND PARENTS' EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE INFLUENCE THEIR CHILDREN'S EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN KINDERGARTEN SCHOOL?,2015,"Emotional intelligence has been related to several facets of personal and social success as are psychological well-being, academic performance among others. Emotions and its regulation are learned during hood and that learning is affected by the closest context. The   aims to  the relationship between s' emotional intelligence and al  and their  emotional intelligence in early ages. A total of 83 students, 52 s and 62 mothers took part in this . As measure of  emotional intelligence two instruments were used: (a) the questionnaire of Emotional Quotient designed by Bar-On and Parker (2002) to be completed by an observer (s). This questionnaire asses the following abilities: interpersonal, intrapersonal, stress management, adaptability and general mood; and (b) Test of Perception and Assessment of Emotions (PERCERVAL, Mestre et al., 2011). Adults took two questionnaires: (a) an adaptation of Bar-On (1997) questionnaire to assess their own emotional intelligence; and (b) an adaptation of the Robinson et al (1995) questionnaire about  . This questionnaire assesses both: democratic and authoritarian . The obtained  point out that s' al  is correlated with s' emotional intelligence. s'/mothers' with higher emotional intelligence tend to show a democratic al .

Clarifying concepts of food parenting practices. A Delphi study with an application to snacking behavior,2014,"Inconsistencies in measurements of food  practices continue to exist. Fundamental to this problem is the lack of clarity about what is understood by different concepts of food  practices. The purpose of this  was to clarify food  practice concepts related to snacking. A three round Delphi  among an international group of experts (n = 63) was conducted. In the first round, an open-ended survey was used to collect food  practice descriptions and concept labels associated with those practices. In the second round, participants were asked to match up descriptions with the appropriate concept labels. The third and final round allowed participants to reconsider how descriptions and concept labels were matched, taking into account the opinions expressed in round two. Round one produced 408 descriptions of food  practices and 110 different concept names. Round two started with 116 descriptions of food  practices and 20 concept names. On 40 descriptions, consensus regarding the underlying concept name was reached in round two. Of the remaining 76 descriptions, consensus on 47 descriptions regarding the underlying concept name was reached in round three. The   supports the essential process of consensus development with respect to food  practices concepts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Stability and Variability Across and Within Cultures: Implications for Cognitive Theory,2005,"Ethnic diversity is widespread in the modern world, but nations differ in their policies toward ethnic minority groups. Where assimilation of ethnic minorities is allowed or encouraged, a shift in cultural values from those held by the ethnic group to those held in the mainstream is typically part of the assimilation process. Differences in value systems between ethnic groups will affect that process, but so will differences within groups, since individuals will differ as to the extent of their identification with a given ethnic group's values. Differences between and within groups will affect the ways s transmit cultural values, whether traditional or mainstream, to their . A factor is this regard is  , which some theorists contend is  important in the facilitation of 's cognitive development. Research findings are equivocal on the role of  , including its interaction with s' ethnic identification, especially with respect to mediational .

Differential impact of fathers' authoritarian parenting on early adolescent adjustment in conservative protestant versus other families,2006,"The purpose of the  was to determine whether well-established associations between authoritarian  and adolescent adjustment pertain to conservative Protestant (CP) families. Structural equation modeling was used to test paths from biological fathers' authoritarian  to adolescent adjustment in 65 CP versus 170 comparison families in the Nonshared Environment and Adolescent Development Study (NEAD; D. Reiss et al., 1994). The hypothesis that adolescents in CP families would be less harmed by authoritarian  than would adolescents in control families was partially supported: Authoritarian  directly predicted greater externalizing and internalizing for adolescents in control families but not for adolescents in CP families. In contrast, s' religious affiliation failed to moderate the negative associations between authoritarian  and positive adjustment. Understanding family processes specific to the CP subculture is important for helping these families raise competent ."
Bullies and delinquents: Personal characteristics and parental styles,2000,"This  aimed to analyse the personal characteristics and al  of bullies and delinquents, and to establish which factors were related to the bully/delinquent group and which were related to only bullies or only delinquents. A self-report questionnaire on bullying and delinquency was completed by 113 girls and 125 boys aged 11-14 in a middle school in Rome. Bullying and delinquency were more common among boys than among girls. Bullying did not vary significantly with age, but delinquency increased with age. Bullying and delinquency were especially related for boys and for older students. Only bullies were younger, while only delinquents were older, suggesting that bullying might be an early stage on a developmental sequence leading to delinquency. Only bullies and only delinquents had different  correlates; only bullies had authoritarian s and disagreed with their s, whereas only delinquents had conflictual and low supportive s. This suggested that bullying and delinquency are not merely different behavioural manifestations of the same underlying construct.  training interventions might prevent both bullying and delinquency.

Perceived Helicopter Parenting Related to Vocational Senior High School Students' Academic Achievement and Smartphone Addiction,2021,"Background and Purpose of Research Adolescents use their smartphones for various purposes, for example, following distance/online learning, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, staying in touch with friends, having fun using social media tools. According to the social ecological model, risk behaviors, like substance consumption, are regarded as behavior problems. Relatively, etiology is derived of youths' embeddedness surrounded by their social networks, mainly throughout sensitive development periods (Bishop et al., 2020). Given the prevalence of smartphone addiction among young students, previous studies have explored the relationships between smartphone addiction and students' learning and indicated there is negative outcomes of smartphone ing from overuse of mobile phones, including poor sleep quality. However, there some antecedents of smartphone addiction which has not extendedly studied, for example,  , thus, the   aimed to explore the correlates between  , academic achievement and smartphone addiction.  that reflects a combination of support and behavioral control has been linked to numerous indices of academic well-being and live functioning from early hood through adolescence. In regarding the term helicopter  indicated that s involve hovering behaviors and are potentially over-involved in the lives of their  or in their academic work (Padilla-Walker & Nelson, 2012). But empirical  has not adequately used these two construct from other controlling  practices to predict 's smartphone addiction, thus, the   applied two types of helicopter : live hovering and academic hovering of  for of emerging adults, to explain the prediction of 's smartphone addiction. According to Bronfenbrenner (1979) micro ecological system that discusses the association between person-process-content (PPC), who described person-process-context model (PPCM) that occurs variability in development procedure as considered in this paper as a functional context (mobile phone usage), person ( ) and process (academic achievement). Not only has cultural ecology be likely to pursue its complications in issues originating from social and cultural topics, but intricate schools of understanding of culture-nature relationship have developed for certain risk behavior. For example, helicopter  is more obvious in Chinese families than Western ones, even though the s want their  to grow up to be independent and think for themselves. Particularly, Chinese s are more concerned about their 's schoolwork when they are teenagers, which leads to increased helicopter  problems, exacerbating issues such as lack of independence, lack of control, and not knowing how to self-manage smartphone use, which can in turn lead to smartphone addiction. If s are in constant hovering of their 's lives or schoolwork,  develop dependent behaviors. Some studies have indicated that a 's dependent behaviors  in lower motivation to learn and reduced academic achievement. In line with this, drawn on PPCM to understanding the role of academic hovering and live hovering affect participants' smartphone addiction mediated by academic achievement, hypotheses are proposed as follows. Hypotheses (1) Live hovering has a negative effect on academic achievement. (2) Academic hovering has a negative effect on academic achievement. (3) Academic achievement has a negative effect on smartphone addiction. (4) Live hovering has a positive effect on smartphone addiction. (5) Academic hovering has a positive effect on smartphone addiction. Methodology Questionnaire was designed by adapting and translated from previous ed and gave to domain experts to ensure the content validity. Afterward, a purposive sampling was adapted in this , a total of 400 questionnaires were distributed to 4 vocational senior high schools located in Taipei City. 354 of which were collected, ing in a questionnaire collection rate of 88.5%. After 64 invalid questionnaires were excluded, 290 valid questionnaires remained, ing in a valid questionnaire collection rate of 81.92%. Factor analysis was conducted on the valid questionnaires. Results First, helicopter , live and academic hovering had a negative association with academic achievement, with an explanatory power of 20.8%. Second, academic achievement had a negative association with smartphone addiction, with an explanatory power of 38.6%. Third, helicopter  had a negative association with smartphone addiction. Fourth, academic hovering had a negative association with smartphone addiction mediated by academic achievement, with an explanatory power of 20.8%. The  of the  thus indicate that young people who are not independent in life or schoolwork tend to rely on their s, are less able to control their smartphone use, and are more likely to develop smartphone addiction. By contrast, young people who are independent in life and schoolwork and do not need to rely on their s have control over their smartphone use and are less likely to develop smartphone addiction. Conclusions and Recommendations The  of this  demonstrate that if vocational senior high school students are overly dependent on their s in life or schoolwork, they may have lower academic achievement and therefore, they are not motivated to achieve strong academic  and will not restrain their desire to spend time on using smartphone, ing in a tendency toward smartphone addiction. However, when vocational senior high school students do not have to rely on their s to a great extent in life or schoolwork, they are able to act independently, attain high academic achievement, determine what they want to achieve, and arrange how they will accomplish their goals. Therefore, they have the ability to control the time they spend using their phones and will not develop smartphone addiction. This  suggests that s should let their  learn to be independent and autonomous, which should help to effectively reduce the problem of smartphone addiction. Finally, conducting this  highlighted possibilities for future . Some studies suggest that fathers and mothers do not necessarily share the same  , and hence, it is suggested that in a questionnaire survey, the hovering  of fathers and mothers could be differentiated and then analyzed through a differential analysis. In addition, some smartphone use can be designed with time of use to control using time (e.g., Chinese government limited the hours for  to use smartphone). However, how is the effect of the regulation to students' smartphone addiction should be further studied."
The effectiveness of mindful parenting training on attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms in male students,2022,"OBJECTIVE: One of the main influential factors in the occurrence of behavioral problems in  with attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the behavior related to the  . This  aimed at investigating the effect of mindful  training on mothers of  with ADHD in reducing the symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention behaviors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The  method was quasi-experimental with a pre-test-post-test control group. The  population consisted of all mothers of  from 8 to 12 years. Therefore, 24 mothers of  with ADHD whose scores in the Connors questionnaire (  form) were above the cut-off point score and diagnostic interview were selected and randomly paired and assigned into two experimental and control groups. All the mothers were between 30 to 38 years old. The  tools included the Connors questionnaire. Mindful  training was accomplished in eight 90-minute sessions for the experimental group. In the end, the two groups completed the questionnaires as post-test. Analysis of covariance was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The analysis of the  showed the effect of mindful  training on reducing the symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention behaviors of  with ADHD in the experimental group compared to the control group (p-value < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The educational and behavioral methods that s and especially mothers use in response to their 's problematic and undesirable behaviors can increase the incidence of these behavioral problems in the long run. Hence, it is addressed in this  due to the great importance of changing the behavioral and educational methods of such s. The findings generally show that mindful  education has affected the emotional climate governing - interactions and has reduced behavioral problems in  suffering from ADHD."
"Authoritative and Authoritarian Mothers' Parenting Goals, Attributions, and Emotions Across Different Childrearing Contexts",2002,"Objective. The central goal of this  was to explore how rearing contexts might moderate relations between   and mothers' al beliefs and emotional responses. Design. Participants were 76 mothers of  (41 boys, 35 girls) ranging in age from 30 to 70 months. Mothers completed a global measure of   (authoritarian, authoritative). Self-reports of al beliefs (al goals, attributions) and emotional responses (angry, embarrassed, happy) were assessed in response to hypothetical vignettes depicting a variety of 's behaviors (aggression, misbehavior, shyness, prosocial behavior). Results. In situations depicting 's negative behaviors, authoritarian mothers were less focused on empathic goals and attributed  aggression and misbehaviors to less external sources than their more authoritative counterparts. Authoritarian mothers were  more likely to respond with greater anger and embarrassment across all rearing scenarios. Conclusions. Results suggest that authoritarian and authoritative mothers differ in their affective response patterns consistently across rearing contexts, but that more challenging rearing situations accentuate differences in the cognitive reactions of authoritative versus authoritarian mothers. Implications for understanding how general   may be translated into specific al responses are considered."
"Relationship of Temperament and Character Traits, Emotional Regulation and Perceived Parenting With Self-harming Behaviors in Adolescents",2021,"Objectives The current  aims to provide a structural modeling of self-harm behaviors in adolescents based on their temperament and character traits, emotion regulation strategies, and perceived . Methods This is a descriptive/correlational . The  population consists of all high school students (1-3th grade) during 2017-2018 in Tehran, Iran. Of these, 159 with a mean age of 15 +/- 0.75 years were selected by using a cluster sampling technique. they were assessed by Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI),  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ), Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ), and Deliberate Self-Harming Inventory (DSHI). For data analysis, Pearson correlation test and structural equation modeling were conducted in LISREL V. 8.8 and SPSS V. 20 applications. Results Novelty seeking dimension of TCI and maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies had a direct and positive relationship with self-harming behavior. Although harm avoidance dimension of TCI and authoritarian  had no direct effect on self-harming behaviors, they became effective after mediation by maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies. Maladaptive emotion regulation strategies and novelty seeking together were able to predict 22% of the variance in self- harming behavior Conclusion Novelty seeking personality trait and authoritarian  can affect and predict self-harming behaviors of the adolescents."
"Parenting Styles, Identity Development, and Adjustment in Career Transitions: The Mediating Role of Psychological Needs",2018,"Drawing from self-determination theory, this  examines how does perceived  and psychological needs relate to identity development and psychosocial adjustment in Portuguese 12th-grade students (N = 462) who prepare the transition to higher education or to the job market. Path model  revealed two distinct pathways: a growth-oriented pathway from need-supporting  to integrated career exploration, commitment-making and well-being via need satisfaction and a vulnerability pathway from need-thwarting  to both diminished well-being and ill-being through need frustration. Findings suggest that perceived al support is a protective factor, and al thwarting a risk factor for career decision-making, but this relation is mediated by the adolescents' subjective feelings of psychological need satisfaction and frustration. Altogether, they suggest the need to customize interventions with adolescents to address bright and dark trajectories of identity development and establish a supportive counseling climate that facilitates the exploration of different aspects of self-environment in career transition periods."
Maternal Emotion Regulation and Adolescent Behaviors: The Mediating Role of Family Functioning and Parenting,2016,"Prior  links poor maternal emotion regulation to maladaptive  and  behaviors, but little  is available on these relationships during the adolescent period. We use structural equation modeling to assess the influence of poor maternal emotion regulation, measured as emotional reactivity and distancing, on adolescent behaviors (measured as aggression and prosocial behaviors) among 478 adolescents (53 % female; baseline age 10-13 years) and their mothers over a 5 year period. We  tested the possible mediating roles of family functioning and  behaviors between maternal emotion regulation and adolescent behaviors. Results indicated that higher baseline maternal emotional distancing and reactivity were not directly predictive of adolescents' behaviors, but they were indirectly related through family functioning and . Specifically, indulgent  mediated the relationship between maternal emotional reactivity and adolescent aggression. Maternal-reported family functioning significantly mediated the relationship between maternal emotional distancing and adolescent aggression. Family functioning  mediated the relationship between emotional distancing and regulation . The  imply that poor maternal emotion regulation during their 's early adolescence leads to more maladaptive  and problematic behaviors during the later adolescent period. However, healthy family processes may ameliorate the negative impact of low maternal emotion regulation on  and adolescent behavioral outcomes. The implications for future  and interventions to improve  and adolescent outcomes are discussed."
PARENTING PRACTICES AND SCHOOL DROPOUT: A LONGITUDINAL STUDY,2009,"Adolescents' perceptions of   and al involvement in their education were examined longitudinally and related to school dropout among Icelandic youth (N = 427). Results indicated that adolescents who, at age 14, characterized their s as authoritative (showing acceptance and supervision) were more likely to have completed upper secondary school by age 22 than adolescents from non-authoritative families, controlling for adolescents' gender, socioeconomic status (SES), temperament, and al involvement.   seems to more strongly predict school dropout than al involvement. Further,   may moderate the relationship between al involvement and dropout, but not in all groups; only in authoritative families does al. involvement decrease the likelihood of school dropout. Furthermore, even after controlling for previous academic achievement, adolescents from authoritative families were less likely to drop out than adolescents from authoritarian and neglectful families. These findings emphasize the importance of encouraging quality - relationships in order to reduce the likelihood of school dropout."
"Parenting, family functioning and lifestyle in a new culture: the case of African migrants in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",2011,"This  documented the   among African migrants now living in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, and assessed how intergenerational issues related to  in a new culture impact on family functioning and the modification of life. A total of 10 focus group discussions (five with s and five with 13-17-year-old ; N = 85 participants) of 1.5-2 hours duration were conducted with Sudanese, Somali and Ethiopian migrant families. The analysis identified three discrete themes: (i) -related issues; (ii) family functioning and family relations; and (iii) life changes and health. African migrant s were restrictive in their ; controlled 's behaviours and social development through strict boundary-setting and close monitoring of interests, activities, and friends; and adopted a hierarchical approach to decision-making while discouraging autonomy among their offspring. Programmes seeking to improve the health and welfare of African migrants in their host countries need to accommodate the cultural and social dimensions that shape their lives. Such programmes may need to be so broad as to apply an acculturation lens to planning, and to assist young people, s and families in addressing intergenerational issues related to raising  and growing up in a different social and cultural milieu."

Participants were 242 Portuguese fathers and mothers involved in dual-earner relationships and in  preschool-aged . Structural Equations Modeling analyses yielded findings demonstrating that the paths from romantic attachment (avoidance and anxiety) to  stress and satisfaction were fully explained by work-family dimensions, especially the conflict dimension. Implications of these findings for  education and intervention are discussed."
"Child externalizing behavior in context: Associations of mother nonstandard work, parenting, and neighborhoods",2020,"Background:   and neighborhood dynamics are key predictors of youth externalizing behavior. However, other contextual factors, such as s' work-related stress and s' work schedules, have received less empirical attention. Objective: We examine the direct and indirect relationships of four key factors on  externalizing behavior: (1) nonstandard work shift, (2) s' work-related stress, (3)  (corporal punishment and warmth), and (4) neighborhood collective efficacy. Methods: The  sample (n = 1,035) was derived from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS). We use a subset of the FFCWS, inclusive of mothers who reported having worked at Waves 3 and 4. We carry out a multilevel model to examine direct effects of the predictors and to account for nested observations. To examine the indirect effects of the four key factors, we conduct mediation tests. Results: Multilevel model  reveal a positive relationship between both mother's work-related stress (beta = 0.74, p < .01) and use of corporal punishment (beta = 1.07, p < .001) with  externalizing behavior. Neighborhood collective efficacy was negatively associated with  externalizing behavior (beta = -0.81, p < .001). Maternal corporal punishment mediated the effects of mother's work-related stress (beta = 0.092, p < .05) and neighborhood collective efficacy (beta = -0.112, p < .01), while mother's work-related stress mediated the effect of mother's nonstandard work shift (beta = 0.133, p < .01) on  externalizing behavior. Conclusions: Child externalizing behavior is directly and indirectly linked with maternal corporal punishment, work-related stress (related to mother's nonstandard work shift), and neighborhood collective efficacy."
Do the Parent-Child Relationship and Parenting Behaviors Differ Between Families With a Child With and Without Chronic Illness? A Meta-Analysis,2013,"Objective The  meta-analysis compared the quality of the - relationship as well as  behaviors and  of families with a  with chronic physical illness with families of healthy  or test norms. Methods Empirical studies were identified with the help of electronic databases and cross-referencing. Based on 325 included studies, random-effects meta-analysis was performed. Results Although most effect sizes were small or very small, the - relationship tended to be less positive if a  had a chronic physical illness (g = -.16 standard deviation units). In addition, lower levels of al responsiveness (emotional warmth; g = -.22) as well as higher levels of demandingness (control, monitoring; g = .18) and overprotection (g = .39) were observed in these families. However, effect sizes were heterogeneous and only significant for a limited number of diseases. There was  some evidence for higher levels of authoritarian (g = .24) and neglectful  (g = .51) as well as lower levels of authoritative  compared with families with healthy  (g = -.13). Effect sizes varied, in part, by length of illness,  age, rater, assessment method, and target of comparison. Conclusions We conclude that most families with a  with chronic physical illness adapt well with regard to the - relationship and  behaviors/. Nonetheless, some families of  with specific diseases-such as epilepsy, hearing impairment, and asthma-may have difficulties finding appropriate levels of protective behaviors, control, and al warmth and building positive mutual relationships between s and ."
Chinese parenting beliefs in the intergenerational transmission of parental psychological control amongst Chinese families with adolescents,,"al psychological control (PPC) is a   more frequently observed in Asian countries that can be passed from generation to generation. It can exert negative consequences on ; therefore, it becomes essential to investigate its manifestation and associated factors. Intergeneration dynamics can provide valuable information on how psychological control transmits through - interaction and identify potential target to intervene. The current  aimed to examine whether PPC of s associated with that of their  through the endorsement of Chinese  beliefs of control by the . s- dyads including 632 two- families with  (293 females, 333 males, and six without report) from Henan and Sichuan Province of China participated in the current . Apart from demographic information, both s filled in the Chinese al Psychological Control Scale (CPPC). Children filled in the CPPC and Chinese  Beliefs Scale (TPBS). Results showed that the grands' PPC significantly associated with the s' PPC. This transmission followed through a gender-specific path, i.e., grandmothers' PPC only associated with mother's PPC; grandfathers' PPC only associated with father's PPC. Chinese  beliefs mediated the transmission process, except that the mediation of transmission of paternal PPC was not found in the families with boys. The current  provided support of intergenerational transmission of PPC in the Chinese family. It  indicated different strategies Chinese fathers used to raise up daughter and son. It could inform the future practice to alter the  beliefs as a potential target to diminish the impact of PPC in China."

Adolescents' perceptions of differential parenting: Links with attachment style and adolescent adjustment,2002,"The  examines whether adolescent twins' attachment  mediates the association between their perceptions of differential al treatment and their reported adjustment. Data from a survey of 174 adolescent twins are used to assess the links between twins' reports of differential al affection and differential al control, their attachment , and their reported personal self-esteem, social self-esteem, and anxiety. Twins' reports of having been disfavored in comparison with their co-twin were associated with attachment insecurity, anxiety, and lower personal self-esteem. Attachment was found to mediate the association between the twins' reports of differential al affection and their reported anxiety and personal self-esteem. The strongest evidence for mediation was found for twins' reports of differential maternal affection in predicting adolescent twins' anxiety."
Development of alcohol use disorder in young Swiss men: the influence of retrospectively perceived parenting profiles,2021,"This four-wave longitudinal  aimed to examine the associations between retrospectively perceived  profiles in adolescence and the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD) throughout emerging adulthood. The cohort consisted of 190 young Swiss men who completed retrospective reports of  at baseline and a short AUD self-report screening tool at four measurement times (mean age at baseline = 20.18; Time 1: 21.52; Time 2: 25.61; Time 3: 26.99). Latent profile analysis revealed three  profiles in adolescence based on retrospective measures of   and practices: Optimal (the highest levels of involvement, structure and knowledge; 69%), Uninformed (high levels of involvement, moderate levels of structure and the lowest levels of knowledge; 17%), Low Support (the lowest levels of involvement, moderate levels of structure and knowledge; 14%). Using latent growth curve analysis, we found that young men in the Low Support profile experienced a greater increase in AUD severity compared with those in the Uninformed and Optimal profiles. Young men in the Uninformed profile reported higher levels of AUD severity at baseline than those in the Optimal profile. These findings highlight the associations between retrospectively perceived  profiles during adolescence and the development of AUD during emerging adulthood."
Changes in parenting and  behavior after the home-start family support program: A 10 year follow-up,2015,"Background: Home-Start is a  support program in which mothers experiencing difficulties in family life and , receive weekly support at home from a volunteer. The   extends the work of Hermanns et al. (2013), by examining self-reported and observed  and  behavior outcomes at 10.6 year follow-up. Methods: The mothers of the Home-Start group (n = 59), who received Home-Start for on average 6.6 months, a comparison group, who reported elevated  stress and need for support (n = 56), and a randomly selected community sample (n = 36), reported on their feelings of competence about , their  behavior and their 's problem behavior. Observational data were collected on five of the seven measurement occasions, until 8.8 year follow-up. Results: Improvements on feelings of competence, consistent and non-rejecting  behavior and internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors during intervention period are sustained. That means that on the long term, the  and 's improvements did not further improve, nor did they deteriorate. Observational measures showed a decrease in positive and negative  and positive and negative  behaviors in general for all groups. Conclusions: Home-Start, a volunteer-based community wide family support program, contributes to positive short term changes, which are sustained in the long-term. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Implementation of an evidence-based parenting programme with a Latina population: feasibility and preliminary outcomes,2014,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the implementation and adaptation of group Triple P, an evidence-based  intervention developed in Australia, for a Latina population living in the USA. Design/methodology/approach - Mothers with pre-school age  participated in the programme, which was offered by a community mental health agency. The final  sample consisted of 174 Latina mothers. Findings - Participation in group Triple P was associated with clinically significant improvements in maternal mental health,  , and  behaviour problems. Additionally, mothers reported high levels of satisfaction with the programme. Practical implications - Triple P is a promising intervention for Latina caregivers who are concerned about the behaviour of their young . It can be implemented successfully into community-based mental health care systems. Originality/value - This is the first  to examine the applicability of Triple P to Latina caregivers."
The Intervention Nurses Start Infants Growing on Healthy Trajectories (INSIGHT) responsive parenting intervention for firstborns impacts feeding of secondborns,2020,"Background: The Intervention Nurses Start Infant Growing on Healthy Trajectories (INSIGHT) 's responsive  (RP) intervention, initiated in early infancy, prevented the use of nonresponsive, controlling feeding practices and promoted use of structure-based feeding among first-time s compared with controls. Objectives: We sought to examine the spillover effect of the RP intervention on maternal feeding practices with their secondborn (SB) infants enrolled in an observational-only , SIBSIGHT, and to test the moderating effect of spacing of births. Methods: SB infants of mothers participating in the INSIGHT  were enrolled into the observation-only ancillary , SIBSIGHT. SBs were healthy singleton infants >= 36 weeks of gestation. Infant feeding practices (i.e., food to soothe, structure vs. control-based practices) were assessed using validated questionnaires: Babies Need Soothing Questionnaire, Infant Feeding Styles Questionnaire, and the Structure and Control in  Feeding Questionnaire. Results: SBs (n = 117 [RP: 57, control: 60]; 43% male) were delivered 2.5 +/- 0.8 y after firstborns (FBs). At age 1 y, the Structure and Control in  Feeding Questionnaire revealed that the mothers in the RP group used more consistent feeding routines (4.19 [0.43] compared with 3.77 [0.62], P = 0.0006, Cohen's D: 0.69) compared with control group mothers. From the Infant Feeding Styles Questionnaire. RP group mothers  used less nonresponsive, controlling feeding practices such as pressuring their SB infant to finish (1.81 [0.52] compared with 2.24 [0.68], P = 0.001, Cohen's D: 0.68) compared with controls. In contrast to our hypotheses, no differences were detected in bottle-feeding practices such as putting to bed with a bottle/sippy cup or adding cereal to the bottle, despite observing  group differences in FBs. Spacing of births did not moderate intervention effects. Conclusions: RP guidance given to mothers of FBs may prevent the use of some nonresponsive, controlling feeding practices while establishing consistent feeding routines in subsequent siblings."
Does Working with Child Abuse Cases Affect Professionals' Parenting and the Psychological Well-Being of Their Children?,2014,"Work in the field of sexual abuse is extremely stressful and may arouse negative personal reactions. Although these secondary trauma effects are well described on a personal level, there is not enough evidence to understand whether these professionals carry these effects to their homes, families, and offspring. This  aims to identify the effects of working with  abuse cases on the anxiety level and   of hood trauma workers and on their 's well-being. A total of 43 health and legal system workers who worked with abused  in any step of their process and who had  constituted the  group, and 50 control cases, each working in the same institution and having the same occupation as 1 of the participants from the  group and having  but not working directly with  and  abuse cases, were included in the . Participants were asked to fill out a sociodemographic form, the al Attitude Research Instrument, the trait portion of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and an age-appropriate form of the Child Behavior Checklist for each  they had. Professionals in the  working with  abuse cases demonstrated significantly higher democratic  attitudes. Law enforcement workers working with  abuse cases demonstrated stricter and more authoritarian  strategies, as well as more democratic attitudes, than their colleagues. There was not a statistically significant relationship between  abuse workers' anxiety level and their 's well-being among control subjects."
Parenting and Child Anxiety: The Role of Country of Birth and Acculturation in Indian-born Migrants to Australia Relative to Native-born Australians,2020,"Objectives This  investigated the differences in al beliefs about anxiety and   in Indian- and Australian-born mothers in Australia and whether these differentially related to  anxiety depending on maternal background and acculturation. Methods 51 mother- dyads from Sydney participated, consisting of Indian- or Australian-born mothers and their 8-12-year-old . Mothers completed measures of their anxiety, their 's anxiety, their beliefs about their 's anxiety and their bi-dimensional acculturation (if Indian), i.e., an assessment of immersion into both Australian and native culture. Children completed a self-report of anxiety and a measure of their mother's  . Results Indian mothers scored significantly higher on anxious rearing and negative beliefs about anxiety than Australian-born mothers. Moderated regression analysis revealed that Country of Birth did not significantly moderate the relationship between  and  anxiety, but acculturation did. Amongst mothers reporting low Indian cultural retention, negative beliefs about  anxiety and anxious rearing positively related to  anxiety. These relationships were reversed amongst mothers reporting high Indian cultural retention. Amongst mothers reporting high Australian cultural identification, emotional warmth negatively related to  anxiety; this was reversed for low Australian cultural identification. Conclusions Results highlight the importance of considering acculturation, specifically as a bi-dimensional construct, rather than COB when examining anxious behaviours and attitudes in migrants. Findings suggest that cultural adaptation of family treatment should look beyond COB and consider within-group differences in acculturative attitudes and status."
"Higher cortisol is associated with poorer executive functioning in preschool : The role of parenting stress, parent coping and quality of daycare",2016,"Child executive functions (cognitive flexibility, inhibitory control, working memory) are key to success in school. Cortisol, the primary stress hormone, is known to affect cognition; however, there is limited information about how  cortisol levels,  factors and  care context relate to executive functions in young . The aim of this  was to examine relationships between  cortisol,  stress,  coping, and daycare quality in relation to executive functions in  aged 3-5years. We hypothesized that (1) poorer executive functioning would be related to higher  cortisol and higher  stress, and (2) positive daycare quality and positive  coping  would buffer the effects of  cortisol and  stress on executive functions. A total of 101  (53 girls, 48 boys, mean age 4.24years +/- 0.74) with complete data on all measures were included. Three saliva samples to measure cortisol were collected at the 's daycare/preschool in one morning. s completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Preschool Version (BRIEF-P),  Stress Index (PSI), and Ways of Coping Questionnaire (WCQ). The Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale - Revised (ECERS-R) was used to measure the quality of daycare. It was found that  with poorer executive functioning had higher levels of salivary cortisol, and their s reported higher  stress. However,  coping  and quality of daycare did not modulate these relationships. Identifying ways to promote  executive functioning is an important direction for improving school readiness."
Parental Collectivism Goals and Chinese Adolescents' Prosocial Behaviors: The Mediating Role of Authoritative Parenting,,"Prosocial behaviors are important indicators of positive social adjustment during adolescence in collectivistic cultures. Although s play a central role in the process of cultural socialization, it remains unclear how culturally embedded al goals for their  are related to adolescent prosocial development, especially in non-Western countries. Moreover, little is known about whether  practices serve as an underlying mechanism in linking al goals and adolescents' prosocial behaviors. To address these issues, this two-wave longitudinal  investigated the associations between al collectivism goals and Chinese adolescents' prosocial behaviors, with attention to the mediating role of authoritative . Two hundred and eighty-five Chinese adolescents (51% girls; mean age = 12.29 years, SD = 0.64, range = 11-14) completed measures on al collectivism goals,  practices, and their own prosocial behaviors. Results showed that adolescents' perceived al collectivism goals positively predicted their prosocial behaviors one year later, which was partially mediated by authoritative . Notably, the effects of perceived al collectivism goals and authoritative  on adolescents' later prosocial behaviors were more salient when adolescents initially showed a lower level of prosocial behaviors. The findings highlight the positive effects of al collectivism goals in promoting adolescent prosocial development via authoritative  in the Chinese context, and identify the subgroup of adolescents who may derive particular benefits from this process."
PARENTS' EXPERIENCES OF PARENTING AN ADOLESCENT ABUSING SUBSTANCES,2018,"Adolescent substance abuse is one of the social and public health concerns that appears to influence , but little is known about the s' experiences of  adolescents who are abusing substances. An exploratory, descriptive, qualitative approach was employed with in-depth interviews to explore the s' experiences of  adolescents abusing substances. Thematically analysed data produced three themes:  my way, perceived barriers and facilitating factors. Authoritarian, authoritative and permissive   were discussed to create a supportive environment to enhance s' coping strategies. This work contributes to existing knowledge on s dealing with adolescent substance abuse by providing strategies to enhance ."
Mothers' Attachment Style and Information Processing of Stressful Situations Involving Their Children,2020,"This  examined the associations between mothers' attachment  and their information processing of hypothetical stressful situations involving their . 219 mothers of preschool-aged and kindergarten-aged  completed an online survey. Mothers were given five vignettes describing hypothetical stressful situations involving their . They reported the extent to which they expected their  would be distressed; they  reported the extent to which they themselves would cope effectively, would experience varied negative emotions, and would show emotionally focused, distancing, or -supportive responses. Mothers were then given the Experience in Close Relationships-Revised questionnaire to assess their attachment . Mothers' higher avoidant attachment was associated with expectations of less effective coping, increased distancing responses and decreased emotionally focused and -supportive responses. Less effective coping mediated the link between higher avoidant attachment and decreased support of the . Mothers' higher anxious attachment was associated with expectations of increased 's distress and their own less effective coping, increased negative emotions, and increased distancing and emotionally focused responses. Negative emotions mediated the link between higher anxious attachment and increased emotionally focused responses. Thus, mothers' information processing of stressful situations involving their  may be colored by their adult attachment experiences."
Atopic dermatitis: the impact of personality properties of affected  and parental styles of care,2020,"Background Atopic dermatitis is a frequent, chronic, pruritic, inflammatory skin disease that usually begins in early hood. It is a somato-psychic disease which is influenced by the family environment and related emotional instability (neuroticism), however, relevant data are sparse. Objectives To determine the impact of personality properties of affected  and al  of care on the severity of atopic dermatitis. Materials and Methods The  was conducted on 80 patients diagnosed with atopic dermatitis, treated at the Center for Dermato-venereology of the Pediatric Clinic, Clinical Center Kragujevac, Central Serbia. The  included  aged 8 to 13 years, of both sexes, with a diagnosis of atopic dermatitis based on the SCORAD index. The EMBU scale was used to assess al behaviour, and HANES1 and HANES2 scales were used to assess basic dimensions of personality (neuroticism and stability). The Student-t, Chi-square, ANOVA, and Cronbach's alpha coefficient were used for statistical analyses (p< 0.05 was considered significant). Results A statistically significant difference in average score values for both mothers and fathers was observed for the scales, Overprotection (p= 0.007) and Emotional warmth (p= 0.001), but not for Rejection (p= 0.073), Favouring (p= 0.128) or Inconsistency (p= 0.083). Conclusion We suggest that the therapeutic programme for atopic dermatitis requires improvement, with the addition of psychological testing and subsequent psychotherapy to standard diagnostic procedures."
Mentally Ill Parents in Psychiatric Hospitals How do they Perceive their Children and their Own Parenting Behavior and How Much Support do they Desire?,2016,"Background: Offsprings of psychiatric patients are burdened and they are at risk of developing a mental disorder themselves.

They were given standardized questionnaires for  behavior (SDQ),  behavior and subjective need for help in . Results: 21.5% (N=439) of the patients had underaged , 194 patients participated in the . They considered their  as having more psychological/behavioral problems than a control group (N=97). Patients with personality or affective disorders and patients with a high level of psychiatric comorbidity rated their  most problematic. Although patients did not differ from controls in the evaluation of their  , they expressed a higher need for help in . Conclusion:  and education issues need to be considered in the treatment of mentally ill patients. Effective support could be a relief for families and help to prevent mental disorders in offsprings."
Nonmaternal Care's Association With Mother's Parenting Sensitivity: A Case of Self-Selection Bias?,2013,"Although attachment theory posits that the use of nonmaternal care undermines quality of mothers' , empirical evidence for this link is inconclusive. Using data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N=1,233), the authors examined the associations between nonmaternal care characteristics and maternal sensitivity during the first 3 years of 's lives, with special attention to selection effects and moderation by resource levels. Findings from fixed-effects regression models suggested that, on average, there is little relationship between nonmaternal care characteristics and maternal sensitivity, once selection factors are held constant. Some evidence of moderation effects was found, however. Excellent-quality care is related to more sensitivity for mothers with lower family income. Poor-quality care is related to lower sensitivity for single mothers, but not partnered mothers. In sum, nonmaternal care characteristics do not seem to have as much influence on mothers'  as attachment theory claims."
Hong Kong teacher education students' goal orientations and their relationship to perceived arenting styles,2007,"The  examined goal orientations, perceived  , and their relationships in a sample of Hong Kong teacher education students. It was found that students adopted both learning and performance goals but tended to be more performance goal-oriented. Females were more performance goal-oriented than males. As well, students perceived their most influential s to be authoritative. In terms of gender, authoritativeness was more effective with females and authoritarianism worked better with males. It was found that perceived   predicted goal orientations. Authoritativeness was significantly and positively related to learning goals, whereas authoritativeness and authoritarianism were significantly and positively related to performance goals. Besides main effects, there were interaction effects between gender and   on goal orientations. Cultural and contextual factors were considered in interpreting the findings."
"Cooperation, Conflict, or Disengagement? Coparenting Styles and Father Involvement in Fragile Families",2012,"This paper draws on information from the Fragile Families Study (N similar to=similar to 2,695) to examine how different co  emerge and are related to fathers' involvement with young  in a reative sample of unmarried s. The  show that the quantity and quality of paternal involvement is significantly higher when unmarried s establish a cooperative as opposed to a disengaged or conflicted co . Cooperative co is less likely, however, when unmarried s have separated after the birth or were never together as a couple, when fathers are unemployed or have other risk factors, when the  has a more difficult temperament, and when s have fewer  together. This analysis  helps clarify previously equivocal findings concerning the relationship between co conflict and paternal involvement. Regression  show that paternal involvement is not significantly different among s with cooperative and mixed co , indicating that when unmarried s can work together and support each other's  efforts, even if they argue frequently while doing so, fathers remain more involved. At the same time, conflicted co leads to a larger decrease in father involvement than disengaged co. In the context of poorer-quality co relationships, it was conflict that mattered for fathering, not just s' inability to cooperate. Implications of these findings for  education programs are discussed."
Fostering social and emotional intelligence: What are the best current strategies in parenting?,2019,"This review focuses on  practices that are beneficial or antagonistic to the development of emotional and social intelligence in . We start by reviewing the somewhat nebulous concepts of emotional and social intelligence. This is followed by an examination of the association between well-known   such as authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and directive  and various indicators of  emotional and social intelligence. The strategic emotion-coaching   is  examined for its connections to comparable  outcomes.  practices such as inductive discipline and al availability  appear to cultivate emotional and social intelligence in . Finally, over is discussed as a  practice that aply corrupts the development of these traits in emerging adults. We conclude that best practices, where emotional intelligence and social intelligence are the benchmarks, blend al care and concern with a degree of al demands on  that are appropriate for their developmental stage."
The Impact of Culture on Parenting and Psychopathology in Children: A Comparative Study Between Iran and Germany,2017,"Background: Previous  has consistently shown that  behavior and 's psychopathology such as internalizing and externalizing problems are closely interrelated. However, little is known about the impact of culture in this field. Objectives: The aim of this  was to investigate  behaviors, hood psychopathology, and their interrelation in Iran, reing a rather collective culture, and in Germany, reing an individualistic culture. Materials and Methods: In this comparative , participants were 221  from Iran and Germany, who voluntarily agreed to participate. The sample was collected between 2010 and 2011. Levels of  psychopathology were assessed, using the  depression inventory (CDI), and youth self-report (YSR) questionnaire. s completed  behavior check list (CBCL), and  scale (PS). Repeated measures ANOVAs, independent sample t-test, and Spearman correlations were used. Results: Iranian s reported a more frequent use of   of laxness when compared to German s (P < 0.001). Furthermore, both  and s in Iran reported more symptoms of internalizing and externalizing problems than the German sample (P < 0.001). Correlation analysis revealed a stronger relationship between over-reactivity with internalizing and externalizing symptoms in the Iranian group, while in the German sample, over-reactivity was related only to externalizing symptoms (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The  suggests that dysfunctional  such as over-reactivity is related to 's psychopathology across different cultures. Nonetheless, our   provides evidence that specific  practices and the reported levels of hood psychopathology differ between collective and individualistic cultures, and that culture seems to be an important factor in this field."
Parenting practices and oral health behaviors of  in rural Egypt: gender differences in a household survey,2022,"Background  practices influence 's health and development. The current  aimed at assessing gender differences in 's perception of the  practices of both s, and in the association between 's oral health behaviors and  practices. Methods A cross-sectional household survey of 6-12 year old  was conducted in a rural area in Northwestern Egypt in 2019. Clinical examination assessed caries and gingivitis. The Alabama  Questionnaire assessed  practices in five domains (positive , involvement, inconsistent disciplining, poor monitoring and corporal punishment) and the World Health Organization questionnaire assessed oral health behaviors including sugar consumption and daily toothbrushing. Sugar consumption was the dependent variable in linear regression and daily toothbrushing was the dependent variable in logistic regression.  practices were the explanatory variables adjusting for confounders. Effect modification by  gender was assessed. Results The response rate was 94.1% (n = 433), mean age = 9.9 years, 44.1% boys, 17.8% with daily toothbrushing and mean sugar consumption score = 3.4/8. Girls perceived more mothers' positive  than boys (mean = 14.15 and 13.46) and boys perceived more poor monitoring and corporal punishment. Boys and girls differed in the association between sugar consumption and fathers' inconsistent disciplining, poor monitoring (P = 0.004 and 0.02) and mothers' corporal punishment (P = 0.02), and  daily toothbrushing and mothers' involvement, positive  (P = 0.05 and 0.02), fathers' positive  (P = 0.02), mothers' inconsistent discipling and poor monitoring (P = 0.01 and 0.04). Conclusions There were differences between boys and girls in perceiving mothers' and fathers'  practices and in the association between these  practices and toothbrushing and sugar consumption."
Getting ready ahead: socioeconomic status and parenting strategies among Chinese adolescents with emigration intentions,,"Selective migration is traditionally acknowledged as an important mechanism explaining the educational and socioeconomic attainment of immigrants. However, most existing studies employing data in destination countries provide an inaccurate image of the selected features of immigrants. Values and norms often attributed to immigrants, such as high educational expectations, may be shaped by experiences during pre-emigration, rather than originate from distinct cultural values or the immigration experience itself. With data from Chinese Education Panel Study (CEPS), this  finds that   for adolescents intending to emigrate are different in both family norms and al involvement compared to those with no intention to emigrate. Adolescents with emigration intentions are  positively selected on familial income, al education, and mothers' occupational status, but negatively selected on fathers' occupational status. This  identifies a number of other demographic factors that are associated with emigration intentions in the Chinese contexts. These findings contribute to a more comprehensive knowledge of selective migration among Chinese adolescents who potentially emigrate and suggest that distinctive norms and values of emigrants could be shaped by  strategies in the early planning stage of emigration."
Peer Victimization and Depressive Symptoms in Early Adolescents: The Protective Role of Perceived Supportive Parenting,2020,"Objectives As peers become more salient during early adolescence, the perception of supportive  may become an important buffer against peer-related stressors, such as peer victimization. The purpose of the current  was to examine whether perceived supportive  moderates the association between peer victimization and depressive symptoms among early adolescents. The  contributes to the literature by specifically addressing both the source of supportive  (mothers vs. fathers) and the type of victimization (physical vs. relational). Methods Survey data on peer victimization, depressive symptoms, and perceived supportive  were collected from 237 middle school students (50% female; M-age = 12.21 years) in a mid-Atlantic metropolitan area. Results Regression analyses indicated that both relational (b = 0.45, p = 0.0005) and physical victimization (b = 0.35, p = 0.0265) were positively associated with depressive symptoms and that perceived supportive  from both s was negatively associated with depressive symptoms (mothers: b = -0.20, p = 0.0006; fathers: b = -0.14, p = 0.0093). Perceived supportive  from mothers, but not fathers, moderated the association between each form of victimization and depressive symptoms (relational: b = -0.28, p = 0.0258; physical: b = -0.03, p = 0.0275), such that the associations were non-significant when perceived supportive  by mothers was high. Conclusions The  underscore the link between relational victimization and depressive symptoms among early adolescents. Supportive , especially from mothers, may serve as a potential buffer against the harmful effects of peer victimization."
Relationship-based Intervention with Young Children with Autism in Saudi Arabia: Impediments and Consequences of Parenting Stress and Depression,2019,"This investigation examined the consequences and effects of the severity of mothers psychosocial functioning as assessed by measures  stress and depression in a randomised control trial of a Relationship-based Intervention (RBI) called Responsive Teaching (RT). The sample included 28 s and preschool aged  with Autism from Saudi Arabia. RT subjects received weekly - intervention sessions for 4 months. Dependent variables were mothers'  of interaction as assessed by the PICCOLO at post intervention as well as pre- and post-measures of  stress and depression. There were three findings from this . First, mothers who participated in this  had extremely high levels of psychosocial dysfunction. Nearly all reported clinical levels of  stress and more than 40% reported clinical levels of depressive symptoms. Second, high levels of psychosocial dysfunction did not prevent mothers from participating in RT as indicated by their ability to integrate RT strategies into their interactions with their . Third, RT was associated with substantial improvements in mother's  stress and depression. Implication for early intervention practice are discussed."
"Parental interaction style,  engagement, and emerging executive function in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD)",,"Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are known to experience cognitive and neurobehavioral difficulties, including in areas of executive function and social skills development. Interventions for these challenges have focused on a number of areas, including -based training. Despite the general consensus that specific   consistent with an authoritative - warm but firm -  approach may influence behavioral self-regulation, it is not known what specific al interaction  are associated with  engagement and emerging executive function in this population. The current  used an observation-based behavioral coding scheme during - play interactions and associated  report-based executive function measures in  with FASD. Here, we demonstrate that al interaction  with increased responsive/-oriented behavior and al affect are associated with higher levels of  play engagement, while al interaction that has increased achievement-orientation is associated with higher levels of emerging executive function in  with FASD. These findings help inform future studies on behavioral targets in -based training programs and highlight the importance of considering certain al interaction  during - play."
Parenting practices and oral health status in rural areas in Egypt: a household survey,2020,"Background  practices influence 's health and development. The   assessed the association between  practices and oral health status of  living in rural areas in Egypt. Methods A cross-sectional household survey including 190 households and 392  was conducted from May 2019 to January 2020 in four villages in Egypt. Data were collected through clinical examination and interview-based questionnaires of . Clinical examination assessed caries (DMFT and dft), oral hygiene and gingival condition.  practices were assessed using the short version of the Alabama  Questionnaire (APQ) and oral health practices were assessed using the WHO questionnaire- form. Four linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between four outcome variables (oral health indicators: (DMF, df, plaque and gingival indices) and  practices and oral health behaviors (exposure) after adjusting for potential confounders. Regression coefficients (B), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and model adjusted R-2 were calculated. Results Complete questionnaires and clinical data were available for 392  (response rate = 86.34%). The mean (SD) age = 9.93 (3.05) with 54.60% females. Most  (67.60%) had caries in their primary teeth, mean +/- SD of df = 2.94 +/- 3.10, while only 27.30% had caries in their permanent teeth, mean DMF +/- SD = 0.57 +/- 1.13. There was a statistically significant difference between  practices of both fathers and mothers (p < 0.001, < 0.001, < 0.001, 0.008 and < 0.001 for the five  constructs). The adjusted R-2 of the models that included  practices (for DMF = 0.168, for df = 0.400, for plaque index = 0.061 and for gingival index = 0.090) were similar to the models that included oral health behaviors (for DMF = 0.197, for df = 0.421, for plaque index = 0.059 and for gingival index = 0.084). Conclusion The association between oral health status and  practices which- although not statistically significant- was similar in impact to that between oral health behaviors and oral health status, highlighting the importance of  practices to oral health."
Relationship between parenting styles and the development of anxiety and disruptive behavior in  aged 3 to 6 years,2014,"Relationship between the al  and the development of anxiety and disruptive behaviors in  between 3 and 6 years old. al rearing patterns play a key role on the  evolutionary development, affecting in internalizing disorders (anxiety, not evolutionary fears), as well as externalizing (oppositional behaviors, aggressiveness, coping strategies, social competences). The aim of the   is to investigate the relation between al rearing  and the development of anxiety symptoms and disruptive behaviors in  aged between 3 and 6 years. Participants were fathers and mothers of pre-school  (3-6 years old), who belong to two schools located in Madrid and Toledo. The variables which were measured are: disruptive behaviors in , emotional adjustment and al attitudes towards  rearing, through the following questionnaires: BASC, PCRI-M y CBCL. The  obtained showed that, particular attitudes and rearing practices (levels of discipline and support, involvement and satisfaction with , autonomy and role orientation), affect in a significant way to the development and maintenance of disruptive behaviors and emotional disorders in . It is discussed the need to develop educational programs in the family context which bring changes in the way of raise, in disciplinarian practices and in the attention paid to , as preventive strategies for their future learning."

Father's employment status, acculturation, number of  in the home, and 's age and weight status were associated with the use of different  strategies. More control was associated with less FV intake, but more reinforcement was associated with more FV intake by . Fathers play a role in their 's diet and should be considered in future interventions."
Childhood adversities as risk factors for alexithymia and other aspects of affect dysregulation in adulthood,2004,"Background: Affect regulation is assumed to be a biologically based function that can become disrupted by inadequate  and by traumatic experiences. We studied the relation between the perceived al  , and sexual and physical abuse, with alexithymia, dissociation, anxiety and depression. Methods: In a cross-sectional  psychiatric outpatients were administered a structured interview on hood physical and sexual abuse and they completed a number of questionnaires about the   of their s, and about alexithymia, dissociation and mood pathology. Results: Maternal and paternal   were moderately correlated with alexithymia and depression. The paternal   was  correlated with dissociation. Optimal  of one of the s had a buffering effect on the degree of alexithymia, but not on the severity of other forms of affect dysregulation. The effect of sexual or physical abuse did not add to that of al   in terms of predicting<LF>affect dysregulation. However, a positively perceived maternal   was found to have a buffering effect in terms of the degree of alexithymia, if sexual abuse had  taken place. Conclusions: Perceived  does appear to be of some significance in the development of alexithymia. Optimal  of one of the s may protect against the development of alexithymia when the  of the other  is perceived as non-optimal. However, it is likely that other factors besides al care and sexual or physical abuse play an important role in the development of an adequate affect regulation."
"Construct validity of the Parent-Child Sleep Interactions Scale (PSIS): associations with parenting, family stress, and maternal and  psychopathology",2014,"Study objectives: Using a multi-method design, this  examined the construct validity of the -Child Sleep Interactions Scale (PSIS; Alfano et al., 2013), which measures sleep-related  behaviors and interactions that contribute to preschoolers' sleep problems. Methods: Participants included a community sample of 155 preschoolers (ages 3-5 years; 51.6% female). Primary caregivers completed the PSIS.   and behaviors were assessed with laboratory observations and  reports.  and  psychopathology and family life stress were assessed with clinical interviews and  reports. Results: Bivariate correlations revealed significant associations between the PSIS and a number of variables, including lower observed al support and quality of instruction; higher observed al intrusiveness; authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive  ; current maternal depressive and/or anxiety disorders and depressive symptomatology; increased stressful life events; lower marital satisfaction; and higher  depressive, anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms. The patterns of association varied based on the specific PSIS scale. Conclusions: The PSIS demonstrates meaningful associations with , maternal psychopathology, family stress, and  psychopathology and functioning. Findings suggest that the PSIS is a valid measure for assessing sleep-related / behaviors and interactions among preschoolers, suited to real-world settings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Musical parenting and acculturation of South Korean immigrant mothers,2019,"The aim of this  was to explore how South Korean immigrant mothers perceived and supported their 's musical activities and how acculturation might have affected these mothers' musical . A qualitative case  was carried out for this inquiry and in-depth interviews with thirteen Korean immigrant mothers provided rich data about their musical . The interview data indicated that the immigrant mothers had a strong belief about their 's musical engagement and this belief led them to support their  as best as they could even if it required a great amount of time and money. Also, it was clearly found that these immigrant mothers' musical  has been significantly affected by the acculturation process. They all agreed that their decisions on their 's musical participation would have differed if they lived in Korea. Unlike native Korean mothers who showed a tendency to discontinue support for their 's musical activities when they reached upper elementary grades, the immigrant mothers were willing to support their 's musical participation as long as possible. Various factors seemed to have influenced this decision, including a desire for lifelong music participation as a possible tool for college admissions."
Parenting and hood obesity : a quantitative content analysis of published  2009-2015,2016,"Background: A quantitative content analysis of  on  and hood obesity was conducted to describe the recent literature and to identify gaps to address in future . Methods: Studies were identified from multiple databases and screened according to an a priori defined protocol. Eligible studies included non-intervention studies, published in English ( January 2009-December 2015) that focused on  and hood obesity and included  participants. Results: Studies eligible for inclusion ( N= 667) focused on diet ( 57%), physical activity ( 23%) and sedentary behaviours ( 12%). The vast majority of studies used quantitative methods ( 80%) and a cross-sectional design ( 86%). Few studies focused exclusively on fathers ( 1%) or included non-residential ( 1%), nonbiological ( 4%), indigenous ( 1%), immigrant ( 7%), ethnic/racial minority ( 15%) or low-socioeconomic status ( 19%) s. Discussion: While  illustrate that  in the context of hood obesity is a robust, global and multidisciplinary area of inquiry, it is  evident that the vast majority of studies are conducted among Caucasian, female, biological caregivers living in westernized countries. Expansion of  foci and design is recommended to capture a wider range of caregiver types and obesity-related  constructs, improve the validity and generalizability of findings and inform the development of culture-specific hood obesity prevention interventions and policies.

Eight hundred and one grade 10 general level teenagers in 11 high schools of a single educational system were the subjects. Results indicated that the configuration of the family was not the key determinant of effectiveness of family functioning. Instead the  of  turned out to be the main determinant of both family functioning and well being of the adolescents.

"Developmental origins of cognitive vulnerability to depression: Parenting, cognitive, and inferential feedback styles of the parents of individuals at high and low cognitive risk for depression",2001,"In this , we examined the role of three social learning mechanisms in the development of undergraduates' depressogenic cognitive : modeling of s' negative cognitive ; negative inferential feedback from s regarding the causes and consequences of stressful events in the 's life; and negative  practices. We obtained partial support for each of the three hypotheses. Compared to the s of cognitively low-risk students, cognitively high-risk students' mothers exhibited more negative dysfunctional attitudes and inferential  themselves; high-risk students' fathers showed less emotional acceptance and warmth; and high-risk students' mothers and fathers both communicated more stable, global attributional feedback and negative consequence feedback Sor stressful events in their 's lives. In addition, both s' inferential feedback and fathers' emotional acceptance predicted their undergraduate 's likelihood of developing an episode of major or minor depression or the subtype of hopelessness depression during a 2.5-year prospective follow-up period, with some of these predictive associations mediated totally or in part by the students' cognitive vulnerability status."
Overprotective parenting and  anxiety: The role of co-occurring  behavior problems,2012,"The relationship between overprotective  and  anxiety has been examined repeatedly because theories emphasize its role in the maintenance of  anxiety. No  has yet tested whether this relationship is unique to  anxiety, by controlling for commonly co-occurring behavior problems within the same . The current  examined 190  (age 7-13,89 boys) referred to mental health clinics and their s. Results revealed that significant correlations between overprotective  and  anxiety symptoms disappear after controlling for co-occurring  behavior symptoms. It appears that overprotection is not uniquely related to  anxiety. Furthermore, overprotective  was significantly and uniquely related to  behavior symptoms. Researchers and practitioners need to consider co-occurring  behavior problems when working with the s of anxious . (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Intrusive Parenting in Chinese American Immigrant Families: Relations With Cultural Orientations and Children's Adjustment,2019,"This multimethod  examined associations between observed and - and -reported intrusive ,  and  cultural orientations, and 's adjustment in a socioeconomically diverse sample of Chinese American immigrant families. Participants were 239 Chinese American school-age  (M-age = 9.19 years and range = 7.49-10.96 years) and their s from first- and second-generation immigrant families. s and  reported on s' intrusive  and their own cultural orientations, and s and teachers reported on 's internalizing and externalizing problems. Observed intrusive  behaviors were coded from videotaped - conflict discussions. Findings from path analysis indicated that there was a unique positive association between  Chinese orientation and -reported intrusive . a unique negative association between s' American orientation and -reported intrusive , and a unique positive association between  American orientation and observed intrusive . Intrusive  was negatively associated with  adjustment, but associations varied depending on measurement. Findings suggest that different measures of intrusive  are differentially associated with 's adjustment in Chinese American immigrant families."
Emerging Adult Perceptions of Parental Religiosity and Parenting Practices: Relationships With Emerging Adult Religiosity and Psychological Adjustment,2013,"Recent  suggests that little is known about how al religiosity influences  development, in particular the development of religiosity in . Although  posits that direct communication of al religiosity and authoritative  Practices facilitate the transmission of al religiosity to , more work is needed in this area. Specifically, although several studies examined some characteristics in combination, very few studies have examined al religiosity,  practices, and  religiosity simultaneously with respect to how those characteristics predicted  outcomes. Thus, the current  investigated the relationships among perceived al religiosity, emerging adult religiosity, perceived  practices, and emerging adult psychological adjustment as reported by 486 emerging adults. Data were analyzed with a two-stage structural equation modeling approach. Results of measurement models demonstrated significant correlations among all of the constructs examined, and  of structural models demonstrated that the effect of perceived al religiosity on emerging adult psychological adjustment was mediated by emerging adult religiosity and perceived positive  practices. Structural models further indicated that emerging adult religiosity maintained a significant relationship with emerging adult psychological adjustment when examined simultaneously with perceived positive  practices. Thus, perceived al religiosity was related indirectly to emerging adult psychological adjustment through emerging adult religiosity and perceived positive  practices, and emerging adult religiosity and perceived positive  practices were related directly to emerging adult psychological adjustment."

The Association between Parenting Behavior and Executive Functioning in Children and Young Adolescents,2017,"Executive functioning (EF) is associated with various aspects of school achievement and cognitive development in  and adolescents. There has been substantial  investigating associations between EF and other factors in young , such as support processes , but less  has been conducted about external factors relating to EF in order  and adolescents. Therefore, the   investigates one possible factor that could correlate with EF in school-age  and adolescents:  behavior. The cross-sectional  design gathered data from 169  in primary schools, middle-schools, and Gymnasien, and their corresponding s. All  underwent a standardized task to measure EF, the computer-based Erikson Flanker task, which evaluates EF as a function of error rates and response time. A self-report questionnaire was used to assess  behavior. Multilevel analysis was implemented to test the effects of  behavior on EF in school-age . The  show significant associations between various  behaviors and 's EF: High scores on al involvement or al responsibility are associated with low error rates on the Erikson Flanker task, whereas high al scores on inconsistent discipline are associated with high error rates. These correlations between  behavior and EF remained significant despite controlling for  age, maternal education, family income, and baseline performance (i.e., congruent trails on the Erikson Flanker task). No associations were found between al behavior and reaction time on the Erikson Flanker task. These  indicate the important association between  behaviors and EF skills in school-age , and foster the necessity to inform s about ways in they can optimally support their 's cognitive development"
Subjective theories about parental discipline in parenting literature,2019,"Introduction: al discipline is a topic frequently asked for advice by those who consult health professionals. It is related to   and has been scientifically studied regarding its effectiveness and impact on . Objective: To describe the subjective theories about al discipline  in recommendations made by doctors and psychologists in books for s in Spanish. Material and Method: Thirteen books with advice for s, written in Spanish by healthcare professionals published between 2000 and 2017 were analyzed. Data analysis was performed using Grounded Theory procedures adapted for the  of subjective theories, through open and axial coding. In addition, thematic codification was made to describe the cases, identifying subjective mottos and subjective theories for each case, which at the same time were grouped into superordinate subjective theories. Results: The data were grouped into three general subjective theories about al discipline in the books analyzed. These subjective theories differ from one another in the importance attributed to authority, punishment, and the necessity of al discipline. Conclusion: There are differences in al discipline among the books. There is little scientific evidence on the subjective theories of the books. Results differ from historical analyses of these publications in other cultural and temporal contexts. The importance of developing practical guidelines on al discipline based on evidence to guide s by health professionals is highlighted."
"Parenting and Antisocial Behavior: A Model of the Relationship Between Adolescent Self-Disclosure, Parental Closeness, Parental Control, and Adolescent Antisocial Behavior",2009,"This  used data collected from a sample of 840 Italian adolescents (418 boys; M age = 12.58) and their s (657 mothers; M age = 43.78) to explore the relations between , adolescent self-disclosure, and antisocial behavior. In the hypothesized model,  practices (e.g., al monitoring and control) have direct effects on al knowledge and antisocial behavior.   (e.g., - closeness), on the other hand, is directly related to adolescent self-disclosure, which in turn is positively related to al knowledge and negatively related to adolescents' antisocial behavior. A structural equation model, which incorporated data from s and adolescents, largely supported the hypothesized model. Gender-specific models  found some gender differences among adolescents and s, as the hypothesized model adequately fit the subsample of mothers but not fathers. Mothers' closeness to girls predicted their knowledge of their daughters' behavior; mothers' control predicted boys' antisocial behavior."
Individual and gender differences in mindful parenting: The role of attachment and caregiving representations,2015,"The current  aimed to investigate the mediating role of caregiving reations in the association between attachment reations and mindful . Additionally, this  explored differences between mothers and fathers in attachment and caregiving reations and in mindful  and tested whether the proposed model was invariant across genders. A sample of 439 s (67% mothers) of school-aged  completed measures of attachment-related anxiety and avoidance, caregiving reations, and mindful . Path analyses showed that attachment anxiety was associated with lower levels of mindful  through a lower perceived ability to recognize others' needs and more egoistic motivations to provide help. In turn, attachment avoidance was associated with lower levels of mindful  through a lower perceived ability to provide help and to evaluate others as worthy of help. The path model was invariant across genders, although fathers ed higher levels of avoidance, more egoistic motivations to provide help, lower perceived ability to recognize others' needs, and lower levels of mindful  than mothers. This  demonstrates that attachment reations play a critical role in s' ability to be mindful in their relationship with their , although through different caregiving pathways. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The Predictive Effect of Parental Adult Attachment on Parent-Adolescent Attachment: The Mediating Role of Harsh Parenting,2021,"This  examines the relationship between al adult attachment and -adolescent attachment and investigates the mediating role of harsh  from the perspective of family systems theory. The sample included adolescents and their s from 1,030 families in Henan Province, China. Measures included the Experiences in Close Relationships Scale, Inventory of  and Peer Attachment Scale, and Harsh  Scale. The  showed that paternal avoidance negatively predicts father-adolescent and mother-adolescent attachments, while maternal avoidance and maternal anxiety negatively predict father-adolescent attachment and mother-adolescent attachment, respectively. Paternal harsh  not only mediated the relationship between paternal adult and father-adolescent attachment but  between paternal adult and mother-adolescent attachment. However, maternal harsh  only plays an intermediary role between maternal adult and mother-adolescent attachment. The  of the  show that compared with the adverse effects of maternal adult attachment and maternal harsh  on -adolescent attachment, paternal avoidance and paternal harsh  more negatively affect -adolescent attachment, which is not conducive to familial harmony."
Physical abuse during adolescence: Gender differences in the adolescents' perceptions of family functioning and parenting,2008,"Objective: To examine the relationship between physical abuse of adolescents and  by mothers and fathers and whether the association differs by gender. Methods: Subjects were adolescents, 51 girls and 45 boys, documented by Child Protective Services (CPS) as physically abused during adolescence. Comparison subjects were non-abused adolescents, 47 girls and 48 boys, from the same suburban communities. Subjects completed the following: Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale, al Bonding Instrument, modified Conflict Tactics Scale (assessing physical abuse/punishment by each ). Results: Although CPS generally cited fathers as the abuse perpetrators, abused boys and girls often reported experiencing physical maltreatment from both s. Not surprisingly, comparison subjects rated s more positively than abused subjects. For both groups, mothers were perceived as more caring and less controlling, were reported to have closer relationships with their adolescents, and were less likely to use abuse/harsh punishment than were fathers. Differences between the adolescents' perceptions of mothers and fathers were more pronounced for abused than for comparison subjects. Boys' and girls' perceptions of  were generally similar except that girls, especially the abused girls, reported feeling less close to fathers. Abused girls  viewed mothers as less caring than the other groups viewed mothers. Abused girls were  less likely than abused boys to perceive that either , but particularly fathers, had provided them with an optimum  of . Conclusions: Adolescents who experienced relatively mild physical abuse reported dysfunctional family relationships, which may place them at risk of poor adult outcomes. Adolescents' reports suggest that CPS reports may underestimate physical maltreatment by mothers. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

SHIFTING PATTERNS OF PARENTING STYLES BETWEEN DYADIC AND FAMILY SETTINGS: THE ROLE OF MARITAL DISTRESS,2009,"This paper examines changes in how s interact with their toddler-aged  as they move from dyadic to family contexts. Levels of al involvement and quality of  behavior in the two different contexts were examined in sixty two- families with a 30-month-old son or daughter. An independent evaluation of marital distress was  conducted, and it was hypothesized that s in distressed marriages would appear less competent when  their toddler in the presence of their partner than when  the  alone, while s in less distressed marriages would show greater consistency across contexts. Results were generally in line with this prediction; mothers in distressed marriages indeed showed a steeper decline in sensitivity as they moved from the dyadic to family context than did mothers in less distressed marriages. Fathers in distressed marriages showed a more precipitous decline in their level of involvement with the toddler as they moved from dyadic to family settings than did fathers in less distressed marriages. We argue that the most thorough understanding of the 's early family environment will proceed from future investigations that assess, and compare, both dyadic and family group-level in the same ."
Exposure to overprotective parenting and psychopathology in extremely low birth weight survivors,2018,"BackgroundExtremely low birth weight (ELBW; <1,000g) infants are the most vulnerable babies and are at higher risk for experiencing overprotective (i.e., controlling and intrusive) , which is hypothesized to contribute to the risk for mental disorders. Despite the increased risk for anxiety disorders and decreased risk for alcohol or substance use disorders seen in ELBW survivors, no  has examined the impact of . This  investigated if overprotective  mediates links between ELBW birth status and psychiatric disorders in adulthood. Study designParticipants included ELBW survivors born in 1977-1982 and matched normal birth weight (2,500g) control participants (ELBW n=81; normal birth weight n=87) prospectively followed in Ontario, Canada. These individuals retrospectively reported on whether either of their s was overprotective using the al Bonding Instrument. Presence of a current anxiety disorder and of current alcohol or substance use disorders was assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview at age 29-36years. ResultsPath analysis showed that overprotective  was a significant mediator of the association between ELBW status and risk for an anxiety disorder in adulthood and the risk for an alcohol or substance use disorder in adulthood in ELBW survivors. Overprotective  accounted for 53% of the association between ELBW status and the risk for an anxiety disorder in adulthood and 26% of the association between ELBW status and alcohol or substance use disorders. ConclusionsOverprotective  accounted for a substantial proportion of the increased risk for anxiety and alcohol or substance use disorders in adulthood in ELBW survivors. Despite their perceived vulnerabilities, it is important that the s of ELBW survivors be supported in their attempts to facilitate their 's pursuit of independence during hood and beyond."

"Associations between general parenting, restrictive snacking rules, and adolescent's snack intake. The roles of fathers and mothers and interparental congruence",2015,"Introduction: Little  has been done on the role of fathers and  congruence between mothers and fathers. This  aimed to clarify the roles of general  and restrictive snacking rules set by fathers and mothers, and to explore  congruence in explaining adolescents' snack intake. Methods: Adolescents aged 11 to 15 completed a questionnaire assessing their perception of general  constructs (i.e. nurturance, structure, behavioral control, coercive control, and overprotection), restrictive snacking rules set by their fathers and mothers, and their own energy-dense snack intakes between meals. Results: Scores for mothers were significantly higher on all constructs than for fathers, except for coercive control. Generally, higher scores on general  constructs were associated with higher scores on restrictive snacking rules (most of the associations being significant). Most general  constructs were unrelated to the respondents' number of snacks consumed. The use of restrictive snacking rules by both fathers and mothers was significantly and negatively related to respondents' snack intake. Moderation analyses indicated that high levels of incongruence between s attenuated the favorable impact of fathers' rules and nurturance on their 's snacking, but interactions of congruence with three other paternal scales and all maternal scales were absent. Discussion: Our findings indicate that both paternal and maternal general  and restrictive snacking rules play important roles in adolescents' snacking, and that high al incongruence regarding restrictive snacking rules and nurturance could be undesirable.

"A comparison of the effectiveness of three parenting programmes in improving parenting skills, parent mental-well being and 's behaviour when implemented on a large scale in community settings in 18 English local authorities: the parenting early intervention pathfinder (PEIP)",2011,"Background: There is growing evidence that  programmes can improve  skills and thereby the behaviour of  exhibiting or at risk of developing antisocial behaviour. Given the high prevalence of hood behaviour problems the task is to develop large scale application of effective programmes. The aim of this  was to evaluate the UK government funded implementation of the  Early Intervention Pathfinder (PEIP). This involved the large scale rolling out of three programmes to s of  8-13 years in 18 local authorities (LAs) over a 2 year period. Methods: The UK government's Department for Education allocated each programme (Incredible Years, Triple P and Strengthening Families Strengthening Communities) to six LAs which then developed systems to intervene using  groups. Implementation fidelity was supported by the training of group facilitators by staff of the appropriate  programme supplemented by supervision. s completed measures of  , efficacy, satisfaction, and mental well-being, and   behaviour. Results: A total of 1121 s completed pre- and post-course measures. There were significant improvements on all measures for each programme; effect sizes (Cohen's d) ranged across the programmes from 0.57 to 0.93 for  ; 0.33 to 0.77 for  satisfaction and self-efficacy; and from 0.49 to 0.88 for al mental well-being. Effectiveness varied between programmes: Strengthening Families Strengthening Communities was significantly less effective than both the other two programmes in improving al efficacy, satisfaction and mental well-being. Improvements in  behaviour were found for all programmes: effect sizes for reduction in conduct problems ranged from -0.44 to -0.71 across programmes, with Strengthening Families Strengthening Communities again having significantly lower reductions than Incredible Years. Conclusions: Evidence-based  programmes can be implemented successfully on a large scale in community settings despite the lack of concentrated and sustained support available during a controlled trial."
"A comparative study of  temperament and parenting in Beijing, China and the western United States",2005,"The purpose of this investigation was to examine comparable dimensions and linkages between  temperament and   with samples from Beijing, China and the western United States. Participants included 404 mothers and fathers from Beijing, China and 325 mothers and fathers from the western United States. Both mothers and fathers completed Buss and Plomin's (1984) EAS Temperament Scale as well as a spousal-report measure of  . Structural equation modelling was used to identify invariant (statistically comparable) factors for  temperament and  . Within-culture gender comparisons showed that Chinese fathers (relative to mothers) viewed their sons as being more active and sociable than daughters while US mothers (relative to fathers) rated their sons as being more active. Across-culture differences revealed that US s (relative to Chinese s) viewed  as more emotional while Chinese fathers (relative to US fathers) rated their  as more active. Similar and differential cultural patterns of linkages were  found between   and  temperament. Child emotionality was positively associated with authoritarian  in both cultures while  activity level was linked to more authoritative and less authoritarian  , but only in the Chinese sample. Finally,  sociability was found to be negatively linked to cross-gender patterns of authoritarian  in the US while mothers' and fathers' authoritarian  in China was linked to lower sociability in daughters only."
Parenting and social competence in school: The role of preadolescents' personality traits,2015,"In a  of 230 preadolescent students (mean age 11.3 years) from the wider area of Athens, Greece, the role of Big Five personality traits (i.e. Neuroticism, Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness and Extraversion) in the relation between  dimensions (overprotection, emotional warmth, rejection, anxious rearing) and social competence in school was examined. Multiple sets of regression analyses were performed. Main effects of Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience were identified. Limited evidence for moderation and some support of gender-specific  was found. Agreeableness and Extraversion interacted with paternal overprotection, whereas Neuroticism interacted with maternal and paternal rejection in predicting social competence. Mean differences in gender and educational grade were reported. The relationship between environmental effects (such as  during early adolescence) and social adjustment in school is discussed in terms of the plasticity and malleability of the preadolescents' personality characteristics.

Parental Perceptions of Child Vulnerability in Families of Youth With Spina Bifida: the Role of Parental Distress and Parenting Stress,2018,"Objective This longitudinal  aimed to investigate al distress and  stress in relation to al perception of  vulnerability (PPCV) in youth with spina bifida (SB). Methods s of 140 youth with SB (ages 8-15 years at Time 1) were recruited as part of a longitudinal ; data were collected at two time points, spaced 2 years apart. Mothers and fathers completed questionnaires assessing levels of personal distress,  stress, and PPCV. Results Mothers and fathers reported similar levels of personal distress,  stress, and PPCV, but reports of PPCV increased over time. For mothers, both personal distress and  stress were significantly associated with PPCV cross-sectionally, but not longitudinally. For fathers, there were significant cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between  stress and PPCV. The cross-sectional association between maternal  stress and PPCV was moderated by age, with a significant association only for older youth. Conclusions For s of youth with SB, personal distress, and  stress are related to al perceptions of  vulnerability, and  age may moderate this relationship. al personal distress and  stress are important targets for future interventions."
Can parenting practices predict externalizing behavior problems among  with hearing impairment?,2018,"Objective: To identify possible differences in the level of externalizing behavior problems among  with and without hearing impairment and determine whether any relationship exists between this type of problem and  practices. Methods: The Behavior Assessment System for Children was used to evaluate externalizing variables in a sample of 118 boys and girls divided into two matched groups: 59 with hearing disorders and 59 normal-hearing controls. Results: Significant between-group differences were found in hyperactivity, behavioral problems, and externalizing problems, but not in aggression. Significant differences were  found in various aspects of  . A model for predicting externalizing behavior problems was constructed, achieving a predicted explained variance of 50%. Conclusion: Significant differences do exist between adaptation levels in  with and without hearing impairment.    plays an important role."
Children's Play Profiles: Contributions From Child's Temperament and Father's Parenting Styles in a Portuguese Sample,2020,"Using a sample of Portuguese preschool-age , we aimed to identify different play profiles based on teachers' descriptions of social and non-social behaviors, as well as characterize them in terms of 's characteristics (sex and temperament) and fathers'   (e.g., warmth and involvement or punitive strategies). The 243  were distributed across four profiles (identified through a two-stage cluster analysis): Solitary/Reticent, Social Rough, Social, and Social Solitary. A univariate effect was found between play profiles and 's effortful control, as well as fathers' punitive strategies. In addition, a significant multivariate interaction was found between 's sex and the Solitary/Reticent and Social Rough profiles for father's punitive strategies. In this sample,  with social play profiles seem to use diverse types of behaviors during their interactions with peers and in being adjusted within the group. As 's early experiences with peers are a central context for healthy development, a better understating of the diversity of play profiles and its predictors is important for early interventions."
Clustering of diet- and activity-related parenting practices: cross-sectional findings of the INPACT study,2013,"Background: Various diet- and activity-related  practices are positive determinants of  dietary and activity behaviour, including home availability, al modelling and al policies. There is evidence that  practices cluster within the dietary domain and within the activity domain. This  explores whether diet-and activity-related  practices cluster across the dietary and activity domain. Also examined is whether the clusters are related to  and al background characteristics. Finally, to indicate the relevance of the clusters in influencing  dietary and activity behaviour, we examined whether clusters of  practices are related to these behaviours. Methods: Data were used from 1480 - dyads participating in the Dutch IVO Nutrition and Physical Activity Child cohorT (INPACT). s of  aged 8-11 years completed questionnaires at home assessing their diet-and activity-related  practices,  and al background characteristics, and  dietary and activity behaviours. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify clusters of  practices. Backward regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between  and al background characteristics with cluster scores, and partial correlations to examine associations between cluster scores and  dietary and activity behaviours. Results: PCA revealed five clusters of  practices: 1) high visibility and accessibility of screens and unhealthy food, 2) diet-and activity-related rules, 3) low availability of unhealthy food, 4) diet-and activity-related positive modelling, and 5) positive modelling on sports and fruit. Low al education was associated with unhealthy cluster 1, while high(er) education was associated with healthy clusters 2, 3 and 5. Separate clusters were related to both  dietary and activity behaviour in the hypothesized directions: healthy clusters were positively related to obesity-reducing behaviours and negatively to obesity-inducing behaviours. Conclusion:  practices cluster across the dietary and activity domain. al education can be seen as an indicator of a broader al context in which clusters of  practices operate. Separate clusters are related to both  dietary and activity behaviour. Interventions that focus on clusters of  practices to assist s (especially low-educated s) in changing their 's dietary and activity behaviour seems justified."
Interactions between maternal characteristics and neonatal behavior in the prediction of parenting stress and perception of infant temperament,2006,"Background Prenatal cocaine exposure is a marker of developmental risk. Social environmental risk factors may include maternal stress and maternal perceptions of difficult infant temperament. Objectives To examine factors that may predict or moderate maternal ratings of  stress and difficult temperament in cocaine-exposed (CE) infants.Method Neonatal behavior, infant temperament,  stress, and maternal psychopathology were measured in a large sample of infant-mother dyads with prenatal CE and a nonexposed comparison sample. Participants were drawn from an existing longitudinal data set (Maternal Life Study). Result Relations between neonatal behavior and infant temperament ratings were moderated by mothers' ratings of  stress. Relations between neonatal cry and  stress were moderated by maternal psychopathology ratings. Results were unrelated to drug exposure history. Conclusions For mothers of at risk infants (with or without prenatal CE), psychological distress affects the degree to which infant behavioral characteristics are experienced as stressful or difficult. Implications for treatment and outcome are discussed."
Feeding styles and  weight status among recent immigrant mother- dyads,2012,"Background: Research has shown that al feeding  may influence 's food consumption, energy intake, and ultimately, weight status. We examine this relationship, among recent immigrants to the US. Given that immigrant s and  are at greater risk for becoming overweight/obese with increased time in the US, identification of risk factors for weight gain is critical. Methods: Baseline data was collected on 383 mother- dyads enrolled in Live Well, a community-based, participatory, randomized controlled life intervention to prevent weight gain in recent immigrant mothers. Socio-demographic information together with heights and weights were collected for both mother and . Acculturation, behavioral data, and responses to the Caregiver's Feeding Styles Questionnaire (CFSQ) were  obtained from the mother. Results: The 's average age was 6.2 +/- 2.7 years, 58% male. Mothers had been in the country for an average of 6.0 +/- 3.3 years, and are Brazilian (36%), Haitian (34%) and Latino (30%). Seventy-two percent of the mothers were overweight/obese, while 43% of the  were overweight/obese. Fifteen percent of mothers reported their feeding  as being high demanding/high responsive; 32% as being high demanding/low responsive; 34% as being low demanding/high responsive and 18% as being low demanding/low responsive. In bivariate analyses, feeding  significantly differed by  BMIz-score, ethnic group, and mother's perceived stress. In multiple linear regression, a low demanding/high responsive feeding  was found to be positively associated (beta = 0.56) with a higher  weight as compared to high demanding/high responsive, controlling for known covariates (p = 0.01). Conclusions: Most mothers report having a low demanding/high responsive feeding , which is associated with higher  weight status in this diverse immigrant population. This finding adds to the growing literature that suggests this type of feeding  may be a risk factor for hood obesity. Further  is needed to help understand the larger socio-cultural context and its influence on feeding dynamics among immigrant families and families of lower incomes. How s establish a certain feeding  in their home country compared to when they move to the US obesogenic environment, should  be explored."
THE EFFECTS OF PARENTAL PERMISSIVENESS ON ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION WITH REGARD TO POSITIVE PARENTING AND GENDER,2020,"al permissiveness entails low levels of behavioral control evident in easy caving before 's demands, pleads, persuasions or resistance to al demands, as well as allowing a a higher level of freedom to a  or adolescent. Studies examining the effects of al permissiveness are not consistent, and there are studies suggesting that permissiveness can have both positive and negative effects depending on its combination with positive (emotional warmth and acceptance, positive discipline and control) or negative (refection and negative discipline) . The purpose of this  was to examine the effects of al permissiveness on adolescent depression depending on the level of negative and positive . A total of 482 high school students participated in the , out of which 58.09% were girls. The participants completed Questionnaire on al behavior and Child depression scale. The effects of interactions of permissiveness with negative and positive  of both mother and father were tested, separately for girls and boys. The  have shown positive  moderated the effects of al permissiveness on depression in boys, but not girls. In boy, if s exhibit low levels of positive , there were no significant effects of permissiveness on depression, but if s exhibit moderate to high levels of positive , higher permissiveness predicted higher depression. The  suggest that al permissiveness decreases the protective effects of positive , at least in boys. Results  suggest that, in protecting youth mental health, it is useful to direct efforts at educating and counseling s in order to prevent adverse effects of their permissiveness."
Using Primary Care Parenting Interventions to Improve Outcomes in Children with Developmental Disabilities: ACase Report,2012," is central to the health and well-being of . Children with developmental disabilities have been shown to be at increased risk of developing emotional and behavioral problems.  training programs are effective interventions for improving  behavior and family functioning. This paper describes the outcomes of a brief 4-session  intervention (Primary Care Stepping Stones Triple P) targeting compliance and cooperative play skills in an 8-year-old girl with Asperger's disorder and ADHD combined type. The intervention was associated with decreases in  behavior problems, increases in  confidence, and decreases in dysfunctional  . This paper demonstrates that low-intensity  interventions can lead to significant improvements in  behavior and family functioning. Such brief interventions are cost effective, can be widely disseminated, and have been designed to be delivered within primary health care settings. Pediatricians can play a key role in identifying s in need of assistance and in helping them access evidence-based  interventions."
Internet Addiction: A Closer Look at Multidimensional Parenting Practices and Child Mental Health,2018,"This  aimed to examine how both psychosocial variables (authoritative, authoritarian, and shaming, and - relationships) and psychological symptoms were associated with Internet addiction, while controlling for the sociodemographic variable ( gender). A national proportionately stratified random sample of 6,233 fourth-grade primary school students in Taiwan participated in the . Hierarchical regression models were performed to test the  hypotheses. The  show that psychological symptoms, authoritarian , and shaming were positively associated with Internet addiction, whereas authoritative  and positive - relationship were negatively associated with Internet addiction. Girls had lower levels of Internet addiction than boys. In conclusion, this  demonstrates the direct effects of  mental health status, multidimensional  practices, and family relationship on Internet addiction in , and the importance of early individual- and family-based prevention and intervention in addressing related public health concerns of Internet addiction in . The cultural perspectives of  and implications of these findings are discussed."
Parenting behavior and the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide: A mediated moderation analysis with adolescents,2013,"Background: Multiple features of  have been associated with development of suicide-related behaviors in adolescents. However, findings are inconsistent on which aspects of  are protective or harmful and why. This investigation sought to reconcile these discrepancies through the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS), which argues that suicide ideation and the capability to attempt suicide are etiologically distinct. Methods: Responses of 200 Midwestern public school students to the Profiles of Student Life: Attitudes and Behavior survey were analyzed using mediated moderation analysis. Results: Participant sex significantly moderated the relationships between  variables and suicide attempts and these relationships were accounted for by IPTS variables. Specifically, the effect of al support on suicide attempts was twice as strong for girls. Self-esteem mediated this interaction (b=-.011, SEboot=.008, p<.05, kappa(2)=.07). Conversely, the effect of al boundaries on suicide attempts was significant for boys, but not for girls, and was mediated by exposure to violence (b=.029, SEboot=.021, p<.05, kappa(2)=.07). Limitations: This  involved retrospective report with proxy-measures of IPTS constructs. Future  should consider multiple informants and additional measures. Conclusion: Findings highlight potential mechanisms by which  behaviors could influence sex differences in adolescent suicide-relate behaviors, and that some  behavior is associated with reduced adolescent suicide attempts. Findings  suggest the IPTS is able to account for previously identified inconsistencies in the effects of  behaviors on adolescent suicide related behaviors. Implications for theory and intervention are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Influences of parenting on adolescents' empathy through the intervening effects of self-integrity and sense of coherence,2020,"Previous studies have revealed that  is a typical external factor influencing the formation and development of 's empathy; however, little is known about the underlying processes that may mediate or moderate this relationship. This  examined the possible patterns of relationship between , self-integrity, sense of coherence, and adolescents' empathy through a moderated mediating model. A sample of 2228 adolescents participated in this  and completed the measures of , empathy, self-integrity and sense of coherence. Mediation analyses indicated that self-integrity mediated the relationship between positive  and adolescents' empathy. Moderated mediation analyses revealed that sense of coherence moderated the relationship between positive  and adolescents' empathy, as well as the relationship between positive  and self-integrity. The findings of this  can contribute to a better understanding of the mechanism of associations between  and adolescents' empathy. The  obtained from current  can provide guidance for effectively improving adolescents' empathy."
Relative Effects of Parenting Practices on Child Development in the Context of Family Processes,2017,"Previous family studies mainly treated  behaviour as corresponding to family socialisation, which is in fact a multifaceted concept. In the  , two family socialisation constructs, family processes and  practices, were simultaneously investigated for their relative effects on the adolescent development of internalising and externalising problems. Data for analysis were collected from a sample of 223 Chinese - dyads (mothers = 179, boys = 124;  mean age = 16.7, SD = 2.16), and hierarchical linear regression models were employed to examine the relationships. Results showed that both positive family processes and effective  practices were predictive of less internalising and externalising problems in , but the former was more pronounced than the latter. More importantly, the robust predictive effects of  resumed after inclusion of the interaction term of  by family processes, which lends support to the conditionality of  with the moderating effect of family processes. This indicates that  functions are more important in the home environment with low positive family processes, and shows convergence in the family context of highly positive family processes. Implications of the findings for educational and human development practices and future  directions are  discussed. (C) 2017 Universidad de Pais Vasco. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

Risk factors for suicide in Taiwanese college students,2008,"Objective: The authors investigated the personality characteristics, psychopathology,  , and family function among Taiwanese college Students with high, moderate, and low suicidal risks. Participants: The sample included 2,919 First-year college Students (1,414 men, 1,505 women) from a University in Taipei, Taiwan. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire assessed domains covering demographics, personality, psychopathology, frequency of substance use,  , family functioning, and Suicidal behaviors. The authors used mixed models for data analysis. Results: The authors observed a positive linear trend between increased Suicidal tendency and levels of neuroticism. harm avoidance, novelty seeking, psychopathology, and   of low affection, overprotect ion, and authoritarian controlling. Use of tobacco and alcohol and impaired family adaptation and cohesion were associated with high and moderate suicidal risks. Conclusions: Personality, psychopathology, substance use, and familial factors are important correlates of Suicidal risks among college Students in Taiwan. Optimal suicide prevention strategies in the college setting should incorporate the multiple facets of suicidal risks."
"Family, cultural diversity, and the development of Australian adolescent substance use",2019,"Objective Australia is a multicultural country experiencing rapid immigration. New migrant families offer diversity in important cultural practices such as  that can potentially contribute insights for Australian efforts to address public health challenges. Adolescent substance use differs between cultures, and the objective of this  was to investigate potential contributing factors to these differences. It was hypothesized that differing family management practices between cultural groups would predict adolescent substance use. Method This  utilized a large longitudinal  of adolescents in secondary schools in Melbourne, Australia (N = 2,080; aged 12.3 years, SD = 0.5 at  commencement; 55.5% female). Latent Class Analysis and multinomial regression were used to examine  factors and behaviors, and their association with the development of substance use among adolescents from different cultural backgrounds. Results Cross-sectional analyses of adolescent reports revealed no significant differences in   but higher levels of mother attachment, family rewards, and family opportunities among Australian-born adolescents in comparison to non-Australian-born. We observed similar  for comparisons of English speaking only and non-English Language Spoken at Home (LSH). Family management, non-English LSH, alcohol use and antisocial behavior in Year 7 longitudinally predicted alcohol and cannabis use in Year 9, after multivariate control for other risk factors. Conclusion Indicators Cultural and linguistic diversity predicted longitudinal protective effects against adolescent substance use after multivariate adjustment for a range of family management factors. Given broad similarities in  , future  should investigate the varied protective effect of cultural diversity factors across different substances."
Dimensions of the Parent-Child Relationship: Effects on Substance Use in Adolescence and Adulthood,2019,"Background: Several studies have uncovered a relationship between   and the likelihood that adolescents use tobacco, alcohol or illegal drugs. Objectives: This paper extends existing  in two ways. First, we consider a longer time-frame, investigating the relationship between  in adolescence and substance use in adulthood. Second, we explore the pathways by which this relationship is expressed, in particular the extent to which the relationships in question are mediated by age at first use and depression. Methods: Our analysis is based on data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), N = 2954, and is conducted using structural equation modeling (SEM). We consider warmth and control as distinct dimensions of , as well as a typology of  which combines the two dimensions. Results: Warmth is associated with reduced risks of problem substance use in adulthood, via reduced risks of early initiation and a lower risk of depression. al control  has a protective effect via reduced risks of early initiation, but this is offset by a detrimental effect on depression, particularly in the case of older adolescents. We  find that indulgent  is not associated with extra risk of any kind compared with the authoritative , whereas authoritarian and neglectful  are. Conclusions/Importance: The nexus of relationships which we uncover has implications for policy aimed at reducing substance use in the longer term, suggesting that initiatives to promote warm and responsive  may be most effective in reducing the risks of later substance use problems."

"Dimensionality of Helicopter Parenting and Relations to Emotional, Decision-Making, and Academic Functioning in Emerging Adults",2018,"The current  tests the underlying structure of a multidimensional construct of helicopter  (HP), assesses reliability of the construct, replicates past relations of HP to poor emotional functioning, and expands the literature to investigate links of HP to emerging adults' decision-making and academic functioning. A sample of 377 emerging adults (66% female; ages 17-30; 88% European American) were administered several items assessing HP as well as measures of other  behaviors, depression, anxiety, decision-making , grade point average, and academic functioning. Exploratory factor analysis  suggested a four-factor, 23-item measure that encompassed varying levels of al involvement in the personal and professional lives of their . A bifactor model was  fit to the data and suggested the presence of a reliable overarching HP factor in addition to three reliable subfactors. The fourth subfactor was not reliable and item variances were subsumed by the general HP factor. HP was found to be distinct from, but correlated in expected ways with, other reports of  behavior. HP was  associated with poorer functioning in emotional functioning, decision making, and academic functioning. s' information-seeking behaviors, when done in absences of other HP behaviors, were associated with better decision making and academic functioning."
Adaptive and Challenged Parenting Among African American Mothers: Parenting Profiles Relate to Head Start Children's Aggression and Hyperactivity,2013,"Research Findings: This  used a within-group  design and person-centered analytic methods to identify multidimensional profiles of  ,  practices, and related emotional factors in a sample of 274 African American mothers recruited from Head Start programs in the northeastern and southeastern United States. Interprofile differences in 's behavioral adjustment over time were  examined by measuring preschool 's aggressive and hyperactive behavior at 2 time points during the academic year. The  indicated 3 adaptive  profiles and 2 challenged, or less adaptive, profiles among the sample, with a greater proportion of s reed by the adaptive profiles.  profile membership was significantly associated with  aggressive behaviors at Time 1 and hyperactive behaviors at Time 2. Practice or Policy: Implications of these  for fostering healthy  relations during the early hood developmental period are discussed. Future  is needed to refine a typology of  that captures adaptive  techniques utilized within African American families."
Antecedents and outcomes of self-determination in 3 life domains: The role of parents' and teachers' autonomy support,2005,"Due to conceptualizations of autonomy as detachment and independence,  on the -autonomy relationship in adolescence has yielded inconsistent . In the  , self-determination is proposed as an alternative way of tapping into the construct of autonomy. An integrated model of the relationships between perceived  and teaching , self-determination in 3 life-domains (school, social competence, and job-seeking behaviors), and specific adolescent outcomes, was investigated and confirmed. In 2 samples of mid-adolescents (N = 328 and N = 285), autonomy-supportive  was significantly related to self-determination in all life-domains. Autonomy-supportive teaching added significantly to the prediction of self-determination in the domains of school and job-seeking behaviors. Self-determination, in turn, was positively and specifically associated with measures of adjustment in the specific life-domains under investigation. Finally, in both studies, indications were found that self-determination acts as an intervening variable in the relation between the perceived interpersonal environment and adolescent adjustment."
Parenting and Internet Behavior Predictors of Cyber-Bullying and Cyber-Victimization among Preadolescents,2016,"This  investigates the relationship between cyber-bullying (CB), cyber-victimization (CV),  , 's Internet use and skills, on-line disinhibition, and five perceived specific Internet  practices in a sample of 220 Greek elementary students. Bully-victims scored higher in on-line disinhibition, while  of democratic s in safe Internet use, Internet skills, and  communication about Internet use. CB and CV correlated negatively with Internet content  practices and autonomy, and positively with on-line disinhibition. CB negatively correlated with behavioral control. Psychological autonomy, warm involvement and on-line disinhibition significantly predicted CB, while psychological autonomy, CV. Prevention and intervention recommendations are provided."
Parenting Characteristics in the Home Environment and Adolescent Overweight: A Latent Class Analysis,2010,"P and al support and modeling of physical activity and healthy dietary intake have been linked to youth weight status, although findings have been inconsistent across studies. Furthermore, little is known about how these factors co-occur, and the influence of the coexistence of these factors on adolescents' weight. This article examines the relationship between the co-occurrence of various  characteristics and adolescents' weight status. Data are from Project EAT (eating among teens), a population-based  of 4,746 diverse adolescents. Theoretical and latent class groupings of   and  practices were created. Regression analyses examined the relationship between the created variables and adolescents' BMI. Having an authoritarian mother was associated with higher BMI in sons. The co-occurrence of an authoritarian mother and neglectful father was associated with higher BMI for sons. Daughters' whose fathers did not model or encourage healthy behaviors reported higher BMIs. The co-occurrence of neither  modeling healthy behaviors was associated with higher BMIs for sons, and incongruent al modeling and encouraging of healthy behaviors was associated with higher BMIs in daughters. Although, further  into the complex dynamics of the home environment is needed, findings indicate that authoritarian   is associated with higher adolescent weight status and incongruent   and practices between mothers and fathers are associated with higher adolescent weight status."
Struggling with one's own parenting after an upbringing with substance abusing parents,2018,Aim: To add to our knowledge concerning the key elements involved in the individual's experience of growing up with substance abusing s and the ing challenges this involved for their own hood. Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with 19 s who had participated in a mental health intervention programme. All had experienced substance abusing s in their family of origin. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyse the data. They  completed a self-report questionnaire assessing their attachment . Result: Participants reported a high incidence of emotional abuse and neglect coupled with inadequate support from the community. Their own al role was influenced by high al stress and a majority had an insecure attachment . Conclusions: All participants had experienced a very difficult hood which was reinforced by the fact that they received little support from society. Their hood experience and the ing challenges that this created in their own  role could negatively influence their own 's ability to form a secure psychosocial development. It is therefore important to develop instruments that can help to identify  who were raised in misuse families in order to accommodate the transgenerational effects of growing up with substance abusing s.
Maternal Affection Moderates the Associations Between Parenting Stress and Early Adolescents' Externalizing and Internalizing Behavior,2020,"The   investigated the role of  stress in early adolescents' externalizing and internalizing behavior and, particularly, the moderating effect of maternal affection on these associations. The data of 992 early adolescents ((X) over bar (age) = 12.71; 454 girls) and their mothers during the transition from primary school to lower secondary school were analyzed. The  showed that when maternal affection was low,  stress was not related to the changes in early adolescents' externalizing or internalizing behavior. In contrast, when maternal affection was high, low  stress related to a decrease and high  stress to an increase in such behavior. The  were statistically significant and stronger for internalizing behavior; for externalizing behavior, they were marginally significant but showed the same pattern. Overall, the  support the idea that maternal affection provides a context which intensifies (rather than ameliorates) the influence of  stress on early adolescents' externalizing and internalizing behavior."
The Moderating Effects of the Families Improving Together (FIT) for Weight Loss Intervention and Parenting Factors on Family Mealtime in Overweight and Obese African American Adolescents,2021,"Few studies have integrated positive  and motivational strategies to address dietary outcomes such as frequency of family mealtime. The Families Improving Together (FIT) for Weight Loss trial was a randomized group cohort trial (n = 241 dyads) testing the efficacy of integrating a motivational plus family weight loss (M + FWL) intervention for healthy eating and weight loss in overweight and obese African American adolescents. The current  tested the interaction of   (responsiveness, demandingness) and al feeding practices (restriction, concern about 's weight, pressure to eat) and the FIT intervention on frequency of family mealtime over 16 weeks. Multilevel modeling demonstrated significant interactions between the group-based treatment and responsiveness (p = 0.018) and demandingness (p = 0.010) on family mealtime. For the group-based M + FWL intervention, increased responsiveness and reduced demandingness were associated with increased frequency of family mealtime from baseline to 16 weeks. There was  a negative association between al restriction and frequency of family mealtime, but a positive association between al concerns about their adolescent's weight and frequency of mealtime. These findings are the first to demonstrate that an authoritative or nurturing   moderated intervention effects for improving the frequency of family mealtime in overweight and obese African American adolescents."
Parental insightfulness and parenting behavior: a two-dimensional analysis of parent contributions to  cognitive outcomes,2018,"Utilizing a two-dimensional model of  emphasizing both (1) proximity seeking and (2) exploration, consistent with a conceptual framework rooted in attachment theory, the relations between al insightfulness, observed , and  cognitive outcomes were investigated in a low-income sample of 64 of caregivers and their young 3-5-year-old . Specifically, observed al sensitivity (proximity seeking) and intrusiveness (exploration) and al insightfulness assessed dimensionally to capture Positive Insight and Focus on Child were examined in relation to  cognitive outcomes. al intrusiveness was negatively correlated with cognitive performance; however, al sensitivity was not associated with  cognitive outcomes. s' capacity to remain -focused during the Insightfulness Assessment was negatively correlated with observed intrusiveness and was associated with  cognitive performance. These  suggest unique contributions of dimensions of al insightfulness and  behaviors to  cognitive outcomes - specifically, s' capacity to remain focused on 's experience during the Insightfulness Assessment and nonintrusive  behavior, which may reflect strategies to support 's exploration."
Helping or Hovering? The Effects of Helicopter Parenting on College Students' Well-Being,2014,"al involvement is related to many positive  outcomes, but if not developmentally appropriate, it can be associated with higher levels of  anxiety and depression. Few studies have examined the effects of over-controlling , or helicopter , in college students. Some studies have found that college students of over-controlling s report feeling less satisfied with family life and have lower levels of psychological well-being. This  examined self-determination theory as the potential underlying mechanism explaining this relationship. College students (N = 297) completed measures of helicopter , autonomy supportive , depression, anxiety, satisfaction with life, and basic psychological needs satisfaction. Students who reported having over-controlling s reported significantly higher levels of depression and less satisfaction with life. Furthermore, the negative effects of helicopter  on college students' well-being were largely explained by the perceived violation of students' basic psychological needs for autonomy and competence."
Perceived interparental-consistency: relationships between aggressive behavior and life satisfaction in adolescents,2013,"The quality of the relationship between s and their  is connected to different indicators of psycho social adjustment. This  aims to establish to what extent s' permissive attitude had an impact on adolescents' aggressive behavior and life satisfaction. Moreover, it  aims to identify if some kinds of inconsistent   could be related to obtaining favourable or unfavourable rates in the above mentioned dimensions. A total of 1200 compulsory secondary education and first year of non-compulsory secondary education students took part in this . The  show that students whose s have a permissive attitude are less aggressive and more satisfied with their lives. Furthermore, it is observed that in those families where the mother is permissive and the father is not authoritative the negative effects which are sometimes connected to an inconsistent   are reduced."
Self-regulation mediates the relations between family factors and preschool readiness,2022,"This  examined the role of selfregulation in the path from family factors to preschool readiness in China. Altogether 661 preschool  ( M = 43.30 months, SD = 3.6) were sampled from 5 preschools in a coastal city of Southern China. Their s reported on the family routines,  , and the 's selfregulation. And their teachers rated each 's preschool readiness. The structural equation modeling  suggested that: (1) selfregulation could significantly predict 's preschool readiness, including abilities to follow classroom rules, learning dispositions, and social competence; (2) selfregulation mediated the path from family routines to 's preschool readiness; (3) selfregulation  mediated the relationships between authoritative  and 's preschool readiness; (4) authoritarian  directly influenced 's social competence; and (5) family SES only correlated with young 's selfcare and emotional maturity.

Patterns of parenting during adolescence: Perceptions of adolescents and parents,1996,"The purposes of this  were (1) to explore differences in maternal and paternal   and al involvement, (2) to examine the differences between s' and adolescents' perceptions of   and al involvement, and (3) to explore the changes in   and al involvement between the adolescents' ninth and twelfth grade years. Subjects were 244 ninth graders recruited from several school districts in the Southeast and Midwest. Thirty-one subjects participated in a small longitudinal  three years later when they were in the twelfth grade. Measures of maternal and al demandingness, responsiveness, values toward achievement, involvement in schoolwork, and involvement in school functions, designed for this program of , were obtained from both adolescents and their s. Results showed that both adolescents and s perceived mothers to be more involved in  than were fathers during both ninth and twelfth grades. Mothers and fathers were not found to be different regarding their values toward achievement. Additionally, both mothers and fathers perceived themselves to be higher on all aspects of  than their adolescents perceived them to be during both ninth and twelfth grades. In the longitudinal , both adolescents and s perceived levels of  to drop between ninth and twelfth grades, except values toward achievement which did not change. Implications for interpretation of existing  and for considerations of future  are discussed."
We Do Not Own Our Children: Transformation of Parental Attitudes and Practices in Two Generations of Russian Israelis,2015,"As a  of migration and resettlement, the relations between s and  undergo multiple transformations reflecting the new normative milieu and the demands of integration. This  compared  practices in two subsequent generations of ex-Soviet immigrants in Israel: the s who immigrated in the early 1990s and their adult  who started families of their own. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 25 older and 23 younger couples, the findings show that al  evolve towards host-country standards already among the first generation, and this transition is enhanced among the 1.5ers. Yet, even the latter preserve some of the cultural principles under which they themselves had been raised (e.g., intense al involvement in 's education). The adoption of local   was more expedient among economically successful immigrants who joined Israeli professional class soon upon arrival."
An observational measure of 's behavioural style: Evidence supporting a multi-method approach to studying temperament,2004,"This  demonstrates the potential utility of the Behavioural Style Observational System (BSOS) as a new observational measure of 's behavioural . The BSOS is an objective, short and easy to use measure that can be readily adapted to a variety of home and laboratory situations. In the  , 160 mother- dyads from the Concordia Longitudinal Risk Project (CLRP) were observed during an 11-min behavioural sample. Videotaped interactions were coded using the BSOS for 's mood, activity level, vocal reactivity, approach to toys, mood consistency and adaptability. Comparisons between the BSOS observational ratings and mothers' ratings of the  on the EAS Temperament Survey (EAS) provided support for modest congruence between these two measurement systems, and revealed a differential predictive pattern of 's functioning. Specifically, the observation-based BSOS predicted 's cognitive performance and adaptive behaviour during testing, whereas the mother-rated EAS predicted maternal ratings of 's internalizing and externalizing behaviour problems. Both measures were found to independently predict mothers' ratings of  stress. Overall, the findings imply that neither observational measures nor maternal ratings alone are sufficient to understand 's behavioural , and that comprehensive evaluations of 's temperament should optimally include both types of measures.

CONSEQUENCES OF PARENTING IMPACT IN CONTEXT WITH MOTIVATION FOR DIFFERENTIATION OF ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE AT ADOLESCENTS,2018,"The ed  is focused on  impact and motivation for performance as factors of  progress at adolescents. The principal point of the  is based on an analytic-synthetic model of nine fields of family education and motivation for performance which reflects performance motivation and anxiety (breaking and supporting performance). The  sample consisted of 627 respondents. We think the most important is that we pointed out the differences in  success that ed from the interaction of the  impact and the motivation for performance. Some recommendations for pedagogical theory, methodology and practice are a part of our ."
Assessment of discipline styles among parents of preschool through school-age ,2001,"The  Scale (D.S. Arnold, S.G. O'Leary, L.S. Wolff, & M.M. Acker, 1993) is a self-report measure of  practices that has demonstrated sound psychometric properties when used with the s of young . However, less is known about the use of this measure with s of older . This  was conducted to examine the psychometric properties and factor structure of the  Scale in a normative sample of s with  2-12 years old. Findings reveal that the psychometric proper-ties remain strong among the s of elementary school , with minimal differences in scores as a function of 's age. However, the data suggest that the factor structure may differ from that proposed by the authors. Although statistically significant correlations with ADHD symptoms were revealed, the magnitude of these correlations was relatively small. Suggestions for future  and clinical use of this scale are discussed."
"Parenting practices, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and academic achievement in adolescents",2002,"This  was concerned with the relationship between  practices and academic achievement of high school students. A sample of 873 Asian Americans, 1449 Hispanics, 1176 African Americans and 8292 European Americans was selected from the first follow-up (1990) and second follow-up (1992) of the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS). Analysis of variance (ANOVA), hierarchical and stepwise multiple regressions were employed to determine the extent to which  practice predicts academic achievement. The  of the  showed that European Americans are more authoritative than other ethnic groups, but the relationship between having an authoritative   and student academic achievement is supported only for the majority group. Implications for practices and suggestions for future  are offered."
A Comparison of Online Versus Workbook Delivery of a Self-Help Positive Parenting Program,2014,"A noninferiority randomized trial design compared the efficacy of two self-help variants of the Triple P-Positive  Program: an online version and a self-help workbook. We randomly assigned families of 193  displaying early onset disruptive behavior difficulties to the online (N = 97) or workbook (N = 96) interventions. s completed questionnaire measures of  behavior, ,  maltreatment risk, personal adjustment and relationship quality at pre- and post-intervention and again at 6-month follow up. The short-term intervention effects of the Triple P Online program were not inferior to the workbook on the primary outcomes of disruptive  behavior and dysfunctional  as reported by both mothers and fathers. Both interventions were associated with significant and clinically meaningful declines from pre- to post-intervention in levels of disruptive  behavior, dysfunctional  , risk of  maltreatment, and inter-al conflict on both mother and father report measures. Intervention effects were largely maintained at 6-month follow up, thus supporting the use of self-help  programs within a comprehensive population-based system of  support to reduce  maltreatment and behavioral problems in ."
"Brief parenting intervention for parents of NICU graduates: a randomized, clinical trial of Primary Care Triple P",2013,"Background: Preterm-born or asphyxiated term-born  who received neonatal intensive care show more emotional and behavioral problems than term-born  without a medical condition. It is uncertain whether regular  intervention programs to which the s of these  are usually referred, are effective in reducing  problem behavior in this specific population. Our objective was to investigate whether a regular, brief  intervention, Primary Care Triple P, is effective in decreasing emotional and behavioral problems in preterm-born or asphyxiated term-born preschoolers. Methods: For this pragmatic, open randomized clinical trial, participants were recruited from a cohort of infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care units (NICU) of two Dutch hospitals. Children born with a gestational age <32 weeks or birth weight <1500 g and  born at a gestational age 37-42 weeks with perinatal asphyxia were included. After screening for a t-score >= 60 on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL),  were randomly assigned to Primary Care Triple P (n = 34) or a wait-list control group (n = 33). The primary outcome was  emotional and behavioral problems reported by s on the CBCL, 6 months after the start of the trial. Results: There was no effect of the intervention on the CBCL at the trial endpoint (t64 = 0.54, P = .30). On secondary measurements of  problem behavior,  ,  stress, and  perceived  vulnerability, groups either did not differ significantly or the intervention group showed more problems. In both the intervention and control group there was a significant decrease in emotional and behavioral problems during the trial. Conclusions: Primary Care Triple P, a brief  intervention, is not effective in reducing  emotional and behavioral problems in preterm-born  or term-born  with perinatal asphyxia.

BIRTH-ORDER AND FAMILY-SIZE - INFLUENCES ON ADOLESCENTS ACHIEVEMENT AND RELATED PARENTING BEHAVIORS,1995,"The purpose of this  were to confirm birth-order and family-size differences in achievement, to confirm birth-order and family-size differences in , and to examine whether   and al involvement serve as mediators of birth-order and family-size differences in achievement. Subjects were 195 ninth-grade boys and girls and their s from urban, suburban, and rural communities in the southeast and the midwest. Questionnaire measures of adolescents' and s' perceptions of   and al involvement were used. Birth-order and family-size differences were found in adolescents' achievement and perceptions of   and al involvement but not in s' perceptions of . However, these  characteristics did not mediate the differences seen in achievement by birth order and family size. Implications of these findings are discussed."
Development and validation of the parental authority questionnaire - Revised,2002,"Baumrind's conceptualization of   has influenced  and theorizing about -rearing for more than 30 years, yet few clinical applications of this work have been realized. The purpose of this  was to examine the psychometric properties of a   measure, the al Authority Questionnaire - Revised (PAQ-R). This project furthered the development and validation of the instrument by examining the factor structure, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and convergent validity of the PAQ-R in a large, ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample. The factor structure and reliability of the PAQ-R was modest, but generally within the acceptable range. Specifically, the Authoritarian and Permissive subscales of the PAQ-R had modest reliability and convergent validity; these PAQ-R subscales correlated with relevant subscales of the  Scale and the -Child Relationship Inventory. By contrast, the Authoritativeness subscale had poorer psychometric properties when used in lower SES, primarily African American populations. While African American mothers in the sample reported being more Permissive than did Caucasian mothers, these differences disappeared after controlling for income and maternal education. By contrast, African American mothers continued to report more Authoritarian attitudes even after controlling for income and maternal education."
Adolescents conceived by IVF: parenting and psychosocial adjustment,2008,"A follow-up  was conducted in mid-adolescence on  and the 's psychosocial development after in vitro fertilization (IVF). The first phase of the  had compared 31 IVF families and 31 families with a naturally conceived  when the  were 2 years old (Colpin et al., 1995). Of these, 24 IVF families and 21 control families participated again when the  were 15-16 years old. Fathers, mothers and adolescents completed questionnaires assessing   and stress, and adolescent psychosocial adjustment. No significant differences were found in self- or adolescent-reported  , or in  stress between IVF mothers and mothers in the control group, nor between IVF fathers and fathers in the control group. Neither did we find significant differences in self- or -reported behavioural problems between adolescents conceived by IVF and those conceived naturally. Comparison of behavioural problems between IVF adolescents informed or not informed about the IVF conception did not reveal significant differences.  and 15-16-year-old adolescents' psychosocial adjustment did not differ significantly between IVF families and control families. This  is, to the best of our knowledge, the first psychosocial follow-up in mid-adolescence, and adds to the evidence that IVF  and their s are well-adjusted. Large-scale studies in adolescence are needed to support these findings."
Authoritarian Parenting Effect on Children's Executive Control and Individual Alpha Peak Frequency,2021,"There is increasing evidence that the authoritarian   has a negative effect on 's executive control, but little is known about the neurobiological mechanism behind this effect, especially the evidence of the resting-state EEG related to 's brain function. The current  explored the relations between authoritarian  and 's executive control among 40  aged 8-11 years old and examined associations between authoritarian  and individual alpha peak frequency (iAPF). Hierarchical regression analysis indicated that after controlling for 's age and al socioeconomic status, authoritarian   negatively predicts the 's executive control and iAPF in EEG. This  extends previous  on the effect of   on 's cognitive abilities and provides evidence at the level of neural mechanisms."
Which parents dropout from an evidence-based parenting programme (Triple-P) at CAMHS? Comparison of programme-completing and dropout parents,2019,"Evidence-based  programmes are beneficial for 's behavioural and emotional problems as well as  practices. Along with effectiveness, attendance affects the programme outcome and identification of risks associated with dropout may aid in development of special policy to increase engagement. In this , we aimed to compare sociodemographics, al attitudes,  behavioural and emotional problems of programme-completing and dropout s from Level-4 Triple-P  programme applied at Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). We  aimed to determine the attrition rate. In addition, we inquired whether there was a change in   and  behaviour and emotional problems before and after Level-4 Triple-P for the programme-completing s at CAMHS. Results displayed that 52% (n = 58) of the s who were significantly less educated, used hostile rejecting attitudes, and reported more hyperactive/inattentive behaviour in their  compared to the s who competed the programme (p = 0.022, p = 0.016, p = 0.027, respectively) discontinued the programme. s who were able to complete the programme (n = 54) reported a reduction in over- and improvements in 's conduct problems along with overall stress levels before and after Triple-P (p = 0.009, p = 0.040, p = 0.023). s at risk of discontinuing  programmes may require special policy to be engaged since these programmes may offer significant benefits for  practices and, in turn, 's well-being."
Feeding styles and evening family meals among recent immigrants,2013,"The protective effect of family meals on unhealthy weight gain and diet has been shown across multiple age groups; however, it is unknown whether a similar effect is  among diverse immigrant populations. In addition, little  has focused on factors associated with the frequency of evening family meals, such as feeding  (how s interact with their  around feeding). Therefore the goals of this paper are to explore the 1) association between the frequency of evening family meals and  weight status among new immigrant families, and 2) influence of immigrant mothers' feeding  on the frequency of evening family meals. Baseline self-reported socio-demographic information and measured heights and weights were collected for both mother and  (age range: 3-12 years) among 387 mother- dyads enrolled in Live Well, a community-based, participatory-, randomized controlled life intervention to prevent excessive weight gain in recent (<10 years in the U. S.) immigrant mothers and . For , height and weight measurements were transformed into BMI z-scores using age-and sex-specific CDC standards and categorized as overweight (85th-94th percentile) and obese (>= 95th percentile); mothers' BMI was calculated. Frequency of evening family meals, eating dinner in front of the TV, acculturation and responses to the Caregiver's Feeding Styles Questionnaire (CFSQ) were  obtained from the mother. Children were categorized as eating evening family meals regularly if they had an evening family meal >= 5 times per week. Overall, 20% of  were overweight and 25% were obese. Less than half (40.9%) of families had regular evening family meals. In multivariate analyses, adjusting for covariates,  who were overweight/obese were significantly less likely to have >= 5 evening family meals/week compared with normal weight  (OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.32-0.82). Mothers who had a low demanding/high responsive or a low demanding/low responsive feeding , were less likely to have >= 5 evening family meals/week compared to mothers with a high demanding/high responsive feeding  (OR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.18-0.0.96, OR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.13-0.87, respectively). Future interventions and programs that seek to help s establish healthy household routines, such as family meals, may consider tailoring to specific maternal feeding ."

This  explored patterns of al migration and frequency and correlates of mental health problems among CMP. A total of 889 adolescents, aged 13-18 years, with migrant (s) participated in the  . Results showed a high prevalence of mental health problems, with dysthymia (51%) being the most common. As for  , inconsistency was found to increase the risk for depression and dysthymia. Higher involvement from s significantly decreased the risk for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, panic, and substance abuse.

Academic Goals and Parental Control in Primary School Children,2020,"  have been used to explain the effects of family socialization on 's learning skills. In this , we have considered build an instrument for evaluating academic goals in the primary school stage, that allows us determine the relationships between the different types of goals and the different ways of establishing and policing the rules that the participants perceive from their s. Those participating in this  were 550 pupils from of primary education. The Questionnaire on Academic Goals (QAG) has highly acceptable psychometric characteriztics. The analysis has shown the existence of four solid, well-defined factors. The relationships between the different types of goals and the different ways of establishing and policing the rules are verified. The pupils classified in the groups concerning the goals of social evaluation and reward were characterized by a more indulgent  , determined by an absence of rules and limits for their 's behavior. On the other hand, those pupils classified in the groups concerning the goals of learning and achievement were characterized by s with an inductive , determined by the use of reasoning and explanations towards their  in so far as the consequences of breaking the rules."
"Maternal Feeding Practices, Health Cognitions, and Children's Eating Styles and Weight Status",2019,"Objective: To examine the relationship between maternal cognitions related to promoting a healthy life in their , maternal feeding practices, 's eating , and  weight status in  aged 4 to 6 years. Methods: Cross-sectional questionnaire data were collected in 251 Dutch mothers of preschoolers. Structural equation modeling was used to test the fit of a model that assumed maternal health cognitions would predict maternal feeding practices, which in turn would predict 's eating  and  weight status. Explorative analyses were conducted to examine  characteristics as predictors of maternal health cognitions and feeding practices. Results: Mothers with higher self-efficacy used fewer pressure-to-eat feeding techniques, which in turn was related to less avoidant eating  in . In addition, mothers who perceived more benefits of a healthy life used more restriction techniques, which in turn predicted a more approach-oriented eating  in , which was  related to higher  standard deviation scores body mass index. Finally,  with an avoidant eating  had mothers who perceived more barriers and reported less self-efficacy. Conclusion: Self-efficacy and perceived benefits relate to maternal feeding practices and eating  of the . However, more perceived benefits of a healthy life were associated with inadequate feeding practices. Therefore, interventions targeted at mothers to reduce  overweight should focus not only on reinforcing perceived benefits of a healthy life but  on how the mother can translate her attitudes into adaptive  to achieve the desired health outcomes."
PERSONAL ADJUSTMENT DURING PREGNANCY AND ADOLESCENT PARENTING,1993,"This  examined ''naturally occurring differences'' in personal adjustment (social competence, behavior problems, and problem-solving skills) among reative groups of pregnant and nonpregnant adolescents and pregnant adults. Differences in  stress and   were  assessed among a subsample of adolescent and adult mothers. Finally, the relationship between prenatally assessed personal adjustment and  was evaluated in the adolescent mother group. The contributions of important demographic characteristics (socioeconomic status and race) to both between- and within-group relationships were examined. Results suggested that pregnant adolescents were less socially competent and less proficient in their problem solving than their nonpregnant peers and that they exhibited more behavioral problems than a pregnant adult comparison group. Adolescent mothers displayed higher levels of  stress and were less responsive and sensitive in interactions with their infants than adult mothers. Support for the hypothesized link between prenatally assessed personal adjustment and adolescent  stress was found, whereas no relationship between socioeconomic status and race and  stress was established. These  suggest that intervention with young mothers identified during pregnancy as having personal problems might forestall  problems that arise during early  rearing."
Does Culture Matter? A Qualitative Inquiry of Helicopter Parenting in Korean American College Students,2017,"The purpose of this  was to examine college students' culturally-mediated perceptions, prevalence, and experiences of helicopter  and its potential impact on their development. Using an online survey platform, we conducted an online survey of 40 Korean American college students in three large universities in the Southeastern region of the U.S. The majority of the participating Korean American college students acknowledged the negative aspects of helicopter  and its negative impact on various outcomes in students while recognizing the s' benevolent intent and positive effects on academics and career preparation. The findings were mostly consistent with previous  but added rich description and cultural nuance and meaning of helicopter  and its perceived impacts on various developmental outcomes to the current literature."
Effects of parental intervention on behavioural and psychological outcomes for Kurdish parents and their ,2018,"Background:  interventions are rarely offered in developing countries and there is an urgent need to include low-income countries. Aims: To examine the effectiveness of Systematic Training for Effective  (STEP) among Kurdish s and their . Methods: This was a randomized control pilot trial using pre- and post-test scores of 17 mothers (mean age 35.25 years, standard deviation 4.3 years; range: 29.58-45.3 years) who agreed to participate in the intervention. We utilized the Alabama  Questionnaire (APQ) to assess  ; al Stress Scale (PSS) to investigate al stress; and Step  Assessment Technique (SPAT) to identify whether participants in the treatment group had learned the material of the intervention. Results: There were significant differences between the groups on 3 subscales of the APQ: mother involvement subscale, F(1.13) = 25.81, P < 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.67; inconsistent discipline subscale, F(1.13) = 25.46, P < 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.66; and corporal punishment subscale F(1.13) = 17.3, P < 0.005, eta(2)(p) = 0.57. A significant difference between groups was  found on the PSS, F(1.13) = 19.63, P < 0.001, eta(2)(p) = 0.60. The changes were sustained over a 3-month period. No significant differences were found in academic self-concept and behavioural problems between  whose mothers attended STEP and others whose mothers did not attend. Conclusions: The STEP programme appears to promote   and reduce the level of al stress in Kurdish mothers."

The preliminary effect of a parenting program for Korean American mothers: A randomized controlled experimental study,2008,"Background: Traditional Korean American discipline is characterized by a lack of expression of affection and use of harsh discipline. Objective: The Purpose Of this Study was to pilot test the effect of the Incredible Years  Program among Korean American mothers. Methods: A randomized controlled experimental  design was used; 29 first-generation Korean American mothers of young  (3-8 years old) were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 20) and Control (11 = 9) groups. Intervention group mothers received a 12-week  program. Control group mothers did not receive the intervention. Mothers reported on discipline  (positive, appropriate, and harsh), level of acculturation, and their 's Outcomes (behavioral problems and social competence) at pre-, post-, and 1-year follow-up intervals. Results: After completing the program, intervention group mothers significantly increased use of positive discipline as compared to control group mothers. Among intervention group mothers, high-acculturated mothers significantly increased appropriate discipline whereas low-acculturated mothers significantly decreased harsh discipline. In the 1-year follow-Lip, intervention group mothers maintained the significant effect for positive discipline. Conclusions: Providing this program appears to be a promising way of promoting positive discipline among Korean American mothers. Published by Elsevier Ltd."

Parenting characteristics and parent-adolescent conflict - A longitudinal study in the Chinese culture,2002,"This longitudinal  examines the relationships between perceived  characteristics and -adolescent conflict in a sample of Chinese adolescents (N = 378). Results showed that global   (concern and harshness) and specific  behavior (responsiveness and demandingness) were concurrently related to -adolescent conflict at Time 1 and Time 2. Longitudinal analyses showed that the relations between  characteristics and -adolescent conflict across time are bidirectional in nature. For the linkage between  quality at Time 1 and changes in -adolescent conflict at Time 2, early  quality predicted -adolescent conflict in adolescent girls but not in adolescent boys. Although -adolescent conflict at Time 1 generally predicted changes in  quality at Time 2, some al differences in the strength of association between the two domains were found."

Have Authoritarian Parenting Practices and Roles Changed in the Last 50 Years?,2014,"This  examined changes in authoritarian  practices and family roles in Sweden over the last 50 years. Data came from 3 cohorts (1958, 1981, and 2011) of young to middle-age adults living in a suburb of Stockholm who answered questions about how they were raised (N-1958 = 385, N-1981 = 207, N-2011 = 457). The  showed a dramatic decrease in s' directive control. Also, over time, s increasingly allowed  to express anger toward them. s' roles changed from stereotyped versions of fathers as decision makers and mothers as caregivers to both s sharing decisions and garnering respect from . Overall, the  suggest that authoritarian  practices have declined dramatically and moved toward more egalitarian family environments. Virtually all these changes in al practices and al roles happened between the last 2 cohorts."
"Intergenerational Transmission of Trauma-Related Distress: Maternal Betrayal Trauma, Parenting Attitudes, and Behaviors",2016,"The purpose of this  was to elucidate mechanisms involved in the intergenerational transmission of trauma-related distress. This  investigated whether betrayal trauma (BT; abuse by a person close to the victim) and specific  attitudes and behaviors among mothers with  abuse histories predicted internalizing and externalizing symptoms in their . Mothers and  (ages 7-11) were recruited for a project on  and stress (N = 72). Maternal betrayal trauma predicted both internalizing (beta = 0.33, p < .01) and externalizing symptoms (beta = 0.25, p < .05) even when controlling for mothers' trauma-related symptoms. Negative attitudes toward limit setting predicted externalizing symptoms (beta = -0.33, p < .05). Poorer communication (beta = -0.39, p < .05) but higher  satisfaction (beta = 0.38, p < .01) predicted internalizing symptoms. These findings demonstrate the importance of assessing maternal trauma and  characteristics as part of interventions with symptomatic ."
Feeding styles among mothers of low-income  identi fied using a person -centered multi -method approach,2020,"Background: Maternal feeding  have been associated with 's eating behaviors and obesity risk. Few works have identified maternal feeding  using a multi-method person-centered approach. Objectives: (1) To identify maternal feeding  using a person-centered multi-method approach, and (2) to examine the association of  weight status with maternal feeding . Methods: Participants were low-income mother- dyads (N = 255) (mean  age 5.9 years) from the United States. Mothers completed questionnaires and participated in a semi-structured interview. Interview transcripts were reliably coded for constructs of  feeding including beliefs, goals, and concerns. Family mealtime video recordings were reliably coded for feeding behaviors. Child anthropometrics were measured. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to determine empirically-driven typologies of maternal feeding . Chi-square analyses tested the association of maternal feeding  with  overweight or obese (vs. not) weight status. Results: Two maternal feeding  were identified by LCA which we term High Coercive Control (27%  overweight/obese) and Low Coercive Control (55%  overweight/obese). High Coercive Control mothers were more likely to believe their  was too thin, self-reported being more demanding in feeding and pressuring the  to eat, worried more about their  not eating enough and were observed to use more bribery. Low Coercive Control mothers were concerned about their  eating too much, and were less likely to selfreport engaging in pressuring or restricting feeding behaviors. Conclusions: The findings suggest that although there is a feeding  characterized by substantial control, this  was most common among mothers of thinner . The mothers of  with overweight/obesity were primarily characterized by engaging in the recommended feeding behaviors and being appropriately concerned about their 's risk for excess weight."
"Transactional models linking maternal authoritative parenting,  self-esteem, and approach coping strategies",2021,"The aim of this  is to identify the transactional pathways among maternal authoritative , 's self-esteem, and approach coping strategies (i.e., problem solving coping and social support seeking coping). We collected three waves of data over three years from N = 888 Chinese  (50.3% girls; M-age = 9.83 years, SDage = 1.28 years at Time 1). Children reported their self-esteem, approach coping strategies, and mothers' authoritative behaviors. Results of the transactional model revealed that 's self-esteem at Time 1 predicted maternal authoritative  at Time 2, which in turn predicted 's use of approach coping strategies at Time 3. Furthermore, the  showed bidirectional associations between self-esteem and maternal authoritative  as well as between self-esteem and problem solving coping.

While out-of-reach helping as a basic type of prosocial behavior was not associated with any of the social and temperamental variables, comforting was associated with maternal responsible , day care attendance, and temperamental fear, accounting for 34% of the total variance in a corresponding regression model. The data of the   suggest that, while simple instrumental helping seems to be a robust developmental phenomenon, comforting is associated with specific social experiences and  temperament that constitute interindividual differences and thereby help to explain the domain-specific development of prosociality.

Development of a Family-Based Nutrition Program Rooted in Food Parenting Literature,2020,"Family-based nutrition programs have been used to support healthy eating; however, few programs emphasize al roles in regard to food. The purpose of this  was to develop and test a family-based curriculum with a  focus aimed at influencing  obesity risk. Qualitative data in the pilot implementation (cohort 1,n = 6 families with elementary-aged ) suggested  value for the following: positive messages, hands-on learning, and group sharing. However, Family Nutrition and Physical Activity scores for cohorts 2-6 (n = 18 families) did not change significantly from pre- to postprogram. Future implementations will consider more robust ways of assessing change and recruiting participants at various stages of change."
"Perceived Child Behavior Problems, Parenting Stress, and Maternal Depressive Symptoms Among Prenatal Methamphetamine Users",2012,"The   was designed to examine  stress, maternal depressive symptoms, and perceived  behavior problems among mothers who used methamphetamine (MA) during pregnancy. Participants were a subsample (n = 212; 75 exposed, 137 comparison) of biological mothers who had continuous custody of their  from birth to 36 months. The subsample was drawn from a larger, ongoing longitudinal  on the effects of prenatal methamphetamine exposure (n = 412; 204 exposed, 208 comparison) (Arria et al in Matern Child Health J 10:293-302 2006). Mothers who used MA during pregnancy reported more  stress and more depressive symptoms than a matched comparison group. There were no differences between groups on perceived  behavior problems. In a hierarchical linear model, depressive symptoms, and perceived  behavior problems, but not MA exposure, were statistically significant predictors of  stress. Screening for potential  problems among mothers with a history of substance abuse is warranted.  interventions targeting depressive symptoms,  stress, and  behavior problems are needed for this population."
Intergenerational Transmission of Rumination via Parenting Behaviors and Family Characteristics: The Impact on Adolescent Internalizing Symptoms,2022,"The relationship between rumination and internalizing psychopathology across the lifespan is robustly documented, yet the development of rumination is not well understood. In a prospective  of adolescents (N = 629, M age = 13.05 years, 51.5% female, 48.3% African American/Black) and their primary female caregivers (90.6% biological mothers), self-report measures of rumination, al behaviors, family characteristics, and internalizing symptoms were completed. Maternal rumination was not predictive of adolescent rumination, but was associated with less effective  and maladaptive family characteristics. Neither  behaviors nor family characteristics predicted adolescent rumination. The indirect effects of maternal rumination on adolescent rumination through  behaviors and family characteristics were non-significant. The well-established relationship between adolescent rumination and internalizing symptoms was replicated, but there was no evidence of the intergenerational process impacting these symptoms. The findings do not support intergenerational transmission of rumination via  behaviors and family characteristics."
The Relation Between Perceived Parenting Practices and Achievement Motivation in Mathematics,2006,"In this , perceived   and al involvement were examined to determine if they predicted student motivation. The two views of motivation examined included achievement goal theory and self- determination theory. Algebra I students (N = 140) in a Southeast Texas public high school completed self-report surveys. Multivariate analyses indicated that perceived authoritative  was positively related to both a mastery goal orientation and higher relative autonomy. Permissive  was negatively related to a mastery orientation and positively related to a performance approach orientation. Authoritarian  was positively related to a performance approach orientation only. Also, behavioral involvement was positively related to both a performance approach and performance avoidance goal orientation. Generally, future  should include measures that are specific to the beliefs and attitudes of adolescents and that address more specific aspects of  ."

If  in  dogs indeed associate with a dog's overweight, these may provide action points for effective weight management. For 2,303 Dutch dog owners, answers on their dog's (nine-point scale) body condition scores were compared to ways of  the dog. We used an adapted version of the 32-item  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire and compared the distributions of dog counts across aggregated body condition score categories of underweight (scores one to three), healthy-weight (scores four and five) and overweight/obese (scores six to nine) with Chi-square tests across the quartiles of a given  .

Moral identity and psychological distance: The case of adolescent parental socialization,2010,"A mediation model using a sample of 1059 adolescents (56% girls. M age = 16 02, SD = 137) tested relations between , adolescent moral identity, and the formation of psychological distance towards others In short, adolescent moral identity mediated relations between  and the ways in which adolescents oriented others in their psychological space. Specifically, adolescent-report   dimensions (responsiveness. autonomy-granting, and demandingness) were positively related to the formation of both private and public Moral identity dimensions (internalization and symbolization), which were in turn associated with a tendency to construct psychological distance towards others (negatively with social dominance orientation and positively with the circle of moral regard). Therefore, one way s may be able to influence how adolescents relate to their peers is by fostering a sense of moral identity in their  through authoritative .

"Applying Socio-Cultural Lenses to Childhood Obesity Prevention among African Migrants to High-Income Western Countries: The Role of Acculturation, Parenting and Family Functioning",2010,"Migration from third-world and low-income countries to high-income Western countries s significant challenges for individuals and families, and for health service providers in the receiving societies. Cultural conflicts related to preferred body size/ shape and  practices, together with differential intergenerational rates and  of acculturation, can affect nutritional and life choices and be associated with high rates of hood obesity. Using African cultures as an example, this paper examines these issues. It concludes that, in designing and implementating obesity prevention programmes, health service providers need to understand these factors and how they play out."
Board-Level Information Technology Governance Effects on Organizational Performance: The Roles of Strategic Alignment and Authoritarian Governance Style,2017,"We report on two empirical studies that explore key factors that help translate information technology governance by the board of directors into organizational performance. The first  shows that strategic alignment partially mediates the effect of board-level information technology governance on performance. The second  demonstrates that authoritarian governance  negatively moderates the effect of board-level information technology governance on performance. Together, these studies open up the black box between board-level information technology governance and organizational performance."

Parents' perceptions of the value of the Webster-Stratton Parenting Programme: a qualitative study of a general practice based initiative,2005,"Background   and - relationships are a determinant of emotional and behavioural problems in . Controlled trials of  programmes have been shown to be effective in helping s of  with clinical levels of behaviour problems, but there is little  on the impact of such programmes in families where 's development falls in the 'normal' range. Also, such trials do not shed light on why or how programmes do, or do not, work, or how they might be improved. Methods A qualitative  of the impact of the Webster-Stratton 's and Children Series' programme on participants in a controlled trial of this programme, whose 's behaviour was below average, but, for the majority, in the normal range. Data were gathered in interviews, open-ended questions on a questionnaire and tape recordings of group leader supervision sessions. Results s reported increased confidence, better relationships with their , successful use of new behaviour management techniques and improvements in their 's behaviour as a  of the programme. One  found the programme unsuitable because she was already using the techniques that were taught, and another  felt the programme was designed for s of younger . Many s reported that additional sessions would have been useful to consolidate what they had learnt, and some s felt the course would have been more effective if their partners had attended. Conclusions The Webster-Stratton  Programme is useful for s of 'normal'  as well as for s of  whose behaviour is in the clinical range. Follow-up sessions and attendance by both s might increase effectiveness. The findings of this  suggest greater benefits to s and  than were ap in the controlled trial."
Cultural orientations and historical changes as predictors of parenting behaviour,2005,"This  addresses the stability and variability of patterns of  in three cultural environments that can be assumed to differ with respect to their cultural models. German middle-class families can be assumed to follow primarily independent socialisation goals, Cameroonian Nso farmers can be assumed to follow primarily interdependent socialisation goals, and Costa Rican families can be assumed to follow an autonomous relational orientation.  patterns of mothers interacting with their 3-month-old babies were assessed at two points in time, being 4 to 6 years apart. The data confirm the predicted cultural differences in  of , which proved to be stable across the covered time span. We  predicted changes in   that should be oriented to a more independent cultural model across the cultural samples. Our data confirm this hypothesis, although the changes are differentially reed in the three samples, with the Cameroonian Nso sample expressing no significant changes and the German middle-class sample reing the most pronounced changes. The data are interpreted as documenting linkages between  and macrolevel societal changes."
Maternal postnatal mental health and offspring symptoms of ADHD at 8-9 years: pathways via parenting behavior,2019,"Exposure to maternal mental health problems during pregnancy and the first year of life has been associated with the development of ADHD. One pathway through which maternal mental health may influence 's outcomes is via its effects on . This  aimed to investigate the mediating role of  behavior in the pathway between maternal postnatal distress and later symptoms of ADHD in the . Biological mothers living with their  participating in the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children with data available from waves 1 ( age 3-12 months) and 5 ( age 8-9 years) were included in the current  (n=3456). Postnatal distress was assessed by  report at wave 1.  warmth, hostility and consistency were assessed by  report at wave 5. ADHD status at wave 5 was ascertained by  report of the  having a diagnosis of ADHD/ADD or by elevated ADHD symptoms by both  and teacher report. There was evidence of an indirect pathway from maternal postnatal distress to  ADHD at age 8-9 years via  hostility, but not through  warmth or consistency, even after accounting for concurrent maternal mental health. Our findings highlight the importance of early identification and intervention for maternal postnatal distress, as treatment may prevent mothers from developing hostile  practices and  disrupt the pathway to ADHD in their offspring."

Parenting and prosocial behaviors in Nicaraguan adolescents: The roles of prosocial moral reasoning and familism,2021,"Despite the surge of interest in understanding the socializing role of s on youth prosocial behaviors, studies on the socialization of prosocial behaviors in Latinx adolescents residing in their native countries are lacking. This  examined the relations among supportive and strict , prosocial moral reasoning, familism values, and six types of prosocial behaviors in s and youth residing in Nicaragua. Participants were 265 secondary school students (M-age = 14.85 years, SD = 1.33; 62% female) from San Marcos, Nicaragua. We found partial support for the hypothesized effects. Specifically, strict  was positively linked to approval-oriented moral reasoning, which in turn, was positively linked to public prosocial behavior and negatively linked to altruistic prosocial behavior. Higher strict  was directly linked to higher emotional prosocial behavior. Moreover, supportive  was positively linked to adolescents' familism values and dire and public prosocial behaviors, and it was negatively related to approval-oriented moral reasoning. Additionally, familism value was positively linked to compliant and emotional prosocial behaviors and negatively linked to altruistic prosocial behavior. These findings were robust across adolescents' gender. Overall, these findings have implications for traditional and culture-specific models of prosocial behaviors and extend our understanding of the roles of , sociocognitive and value traits, and adolescents' prosocial behaviors to Latinx s and youth residing in their native country."

Disciplinary Parenting Practice and Child Mental Health: Evidence From the UK Millennium Cohort Study,2019,"Objective: To investigate whether a longitudinal association exists between differential disciplinary  practices at 3 years of age and later  psychopathology at 11 years. Method: Data were obtained from the Millennium Cohort Study, a UK-wide cohort. Discipline  was assessed using a validated maternal reported questionnaire at 3 years of age for which later outcome data were available. Active (including smacking, shouting, and telling off) and withdrawal (including ignoring, removal of privileges, and sending to bedroom) approaches were distinguished. Child emotional and behavioral problems were assessed at 3 and 11 years of age using the maternally completed Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). The independence of associations between early discipline and later  mental health was investigated using mutually adjusted regression analyses and potential reverse causality was considered by looking at changes in SDQ subscale scores from 3 to 11 years. Results: Differential associations with change in  psychopathology according to discipline type were observed. Active and withdrawal forms of discipline were associated with a decrease in conduct problems from 3 to 11 years (active, beta = -0.28, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.21, p < .001; withdrawal, beta= -0.19, 95% CI -0.24 to -0.14, p < .001). However, active approaches  were associated with an increase in emotional problems (beta = 0.07, 95% CI 0.00-0.14, p = .03) not observed for withdrawal approaches. Conclusion: Different approaches to discipline appear to have differential associations with later  mental health. Further  accounting for a larger number of  and  characteristics is needed to assess whether such associations are causal."

Are food parenting practices gendered? Impact of mothers' and fathers' practices on their 's eating behaviors,2021,"Past  has mainly focused on the links between  eating behaviors and maternal food practices. The impact of fathers and of concordant/discordant food  practices within families has received much less attention. To fill this gap, both s of 105 French  aged 2.01-6.51 years (54 boys, Mage = 3.88 years, SD = 1.40) filled in a survey with items from validated questionnaires. Results showed that fathers and mothers perceived their 's eating behaviors in similar ways (Pearson correlations between 0.34 and 0.78; M = 0.60), despite mothers taking significantly more meals with their  than fathers. Fathers reported using significantly more pressure to eat and food as reward, but reported lower levels of family meal setting than mothers. Moderate to high correlations were observed between mothers' and fathers' feeding practices and . Regression analyses showed that both maternal and paternal practices and  were predictors for  eating behaviors. One interaction effect was observed: in households where both s used higher levels of pressure to eat, the  showed a significantly lower food enjoyment than expected if the effects were additive. Our findings underline the importance of ing the individual role of each  in  feeding  and that both s within families should avoid using coercive practices. This could finally stimulate new interventions and recommendations addressed to both s."
Style of perception of parental relationship and coping in girls and teenagers with diagnosis of Turner's syndrome,2011,"Objectives. The difficulty of women with diagnosing of Turner syndrome to interact with peers is a characteristic widely described in literature, is usually associated with low self-esteem, emotional immaturity and social anxiety. Under the assumption that girls and adolescents with this diagnosis may be exposed to models of compensatory  developing distinctive forms of social interaction, the aim of this paper is to characterize the perception of   and coping in situations of social interaction in this population. Materials and methods. This was applied Argentine Coping Questionnaire and the Argentine Scale of Perceived Relationship with s- mother version- a sample of six  and adolescents diagnosed with Turner syndrome. Results. The  indicate a strong tendency to perceive the relationship with their mothers as democratic, based on the acceptance and use of functional strategies: logical analysis, search of support and cognitive restructuring. These characteristics are similar to those reported to the Argentine population. One possible explanation for these  could be due to the particular psychosocial characteristics of the approached sample."
Mother- relationships of  with ADHD: The role of maternal depressive symptoms and depression-related distortions,2002,"We investigated the Depression-->Distortion hypothesis by examining the effects of maternal depressive symptoms on cross-informant discrepancies in reports of  behavior problems and several measures of - relationship. The sample included ninety-six 6 to 10-year-old  diagnosed with ADHD-Combined Type, and their mothers, who provided baseline data before participating in a randomized clinical trial. Measures incorporated  characteristics, self-reports of maternal depressive symptoms,  practices, and laboratory mother- interactions. Elevations in maternal depressive symptoms were associated with maternal reports of negative   but not with observed laboratory interactions. Mothers' levels of depressive symptoms predicted negative biases in their reports of their 's ADHD symptoms, general behavior problems, and their own negative  . Whereas levels of depressive symptoms did not predict observed  behaviors, maternal distortions did predict problematic - interactions. Exploratory analyses showed a marginally significant mediation effect of the relationship between maternal depressive symptomatology and reports of negative  by depressive distortions. We discuss implications of linkages between depressive symptoms in mothers, depression-related distortions, and mother- relationships for  and intervention in developmental psychopathology."
A Qualitative Study of Family Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors of Mexican-American and Mexican Immigrant Fathers and Mothers,2014,"This  qualitatively examines contrasting al decision-making  about family food choices and physical activities as well as willingness to change behaviors among Mexican-American and Mexican immigrant mothers and fathers of school-aged . Twelve sex-specific focus groups were held in English or Spanish in 2012. Qualitative analysis informed by grounded theory examined   (ie, authoritative, authoritarian, or permissive), barriers to healthy life, and s' stage of change about healthy life. One third of the 33 participating couples were born in Mexico. The majority of mothers and fathers described being permissive and allowing unhealthy food choices, and a minority of mothers reported more authoritarian approaches to promoting a healthier diet for their . Mothers were more permissive than fathers about family physical activities and less engaged in these activities. Most mothers and fathers described only contemplating a healthier diet and more physical activity, while wanting their  to have a healthier life.

Clinicians should  adopt culturally competent approaches to overcome barriers to al engagement in diverse aspects of a healthy family life."
Changes in self-reported and observed parenting following a randomized control trial of parent- interaction therapy for the treatment of preschool depression,2021,"Background  in early hood exerts substantial influence over 's emotional health and development. Using data from a randomized controlled trial of a novel treatment for early hood depression, -Child Interaction Therapy Emotion Development (PCIT-ED), we explored two broad dimensions of  (behavior and affect) to determine whether any changes could be detected following treatment when compared to those in a waitlist control condition. Method 229 caregiver- dyads, 114 randomly assigned to PCIT-ED for preschool-onset depression, and 115 assigned to a waitlist completed two structured interaction tasks at baseline and post-treatment. Interactions were later coded by observer's blind to diagnostic and treatment status. Results Greater reductions were found in self-reported negative  behaviors and observed negative affect and greater increases in self-reported positive  behaviors and observed positive affect among the caregivers in the treatment group. Increases in the overall positivity of the observed interactional  of caregivers, but no observed  behavior change was found following treatment. Discrepancies between self-reported and observed  were greater among caregivers on the waitlist. Conclusions Following PCIT-ED treatment, caregivers self-reported improvements in  practices and declines in punitive practices along with observed increases in positive affect and decreases in negative affect when interacting with their . Moreover, coherence between self-reported and observed  was higher in the treatment group. These findings highlight the efficacy of PCIT-ED in improving  behaviors and the need to use multiple methods to assess  in treatment studies."
Bullying among adolescents in residential programs and in public school: the role of individual and contextual predictors,2016,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to compare rates of bullying and victimization between 50 adolescents in residential programs and 50 control adolescents in regular public schools. Individual (i.e. peer attachment) and contextual predictors (i.e.  , school belongingness) were  examined, and investigated in relation to bullying involvement. Design/methodology/approach - Participants were matched based on ethnicity, gender (all male), and s' income. They completed questionnaires on their bullying involvement, peer attachment, perceived   of their s, and school belongingness. Findings - The findings revealed that adolescents from residential programs had higher rates of bullying and victimization, experienced more permissive  , had lower peer attachment, and poorer school belongingness when compared to control adolescents. The positive relationship between permissive  and bullying was stronger for boys from residential programs. In addition, peer attachment and school belongingness were more negatively related to bullying among control boys. Similar patterns were found for victimization. Differences were  found concerning the relationship of the individual and contextual predictors to adolescents' bullying and victimization across the two groups. Originality/value - These  underscore the importance of ing bullying and victimization among adolescents in secure settings, particularly residential programs."
"Perceived family environment and symptoms of emotional disorders: The role of perceived control, attributional style, and attachment",2007,"Findings from decades of  suggest that a perceived lack of al care and overprotection are positively related to later symptoms of emotional disorders in  and adolescents. The   used a cross-sectional design to evaluate models investigating reported family environment during hood, current attachments, control-related cognitions, and current symptoms of emotional disorders in adolescence. It was hypothesized the effect of a perceived controlling and rejecting family environment during hood would influence current depression and anxiety, and that these effects would be partially accounted for by the quality of current attachments, perceived control, and attributional . A sample of 234 university students was assessed. Regression analyses of variables, including analyses of indirect effects, were conducted. As predicted, current attachment, perceived control, and attributional  helped to account for relationships between some family variables, and depression and anxiety. Findings are discussed with respect to the interplay of family variables and models of emotional disorders."
Is attachment style a source of resilience against health inequalities at work?,2007,"The argument that 'indirect selection' is a contributory factor to health inequality has included ideas about personal characteristics that may originate in hood and increase the likelihood of both poor health and disadvantaged social position in adulthood. The concept of protective resilience makes a similar but converse argument: that positive characteristics acquired at one phase of life may enable individuals to withstand later adversity. The increasing richness of data from longitudinal studies now allows LIS to examine these processes more closely over a longer period of life. In this paper we show that attachment , a psychological characteristic thought to be associated with the  of  encountered during early hood, may act as a source of resilience in the face of educational disadvantage. Men in mid-life who were not burdened with anxious Or avoidant attachment  seem to have been more likely to overcome the disadvantage of a lower level of educational attainment and progress up the ladder of Civil Service grades in the English Whitehall II . As it is not strongly related to s' social class, it can be argued that attachment  has acted as a source of upward social mobility which is  likely to reinforce better health in later life.

Preparing Them for the Road: African Migrant Parents' Perceptions of Their Role in Their Children's Career Decision-Making,2020,"There are numerous theories on  , however, they are Western-oriented and may not be applicable to collectivist non-Western societies. A qualitative  which utilised semi-structured interviews was conducted to explore the perceived  roles of 26 Sub-Saharan African (SSA) migrant s (both humanitarian and professional migrants) in their 's career pathways after they migrated to Australia. Data were analysed using grounded theory methods and this process facilitated the creation of a new framework to provide an in-depth understanding of how SSA   informed the migrant 's career choices while living in Australia. The  revealed that most SSA migrant s maintained their  of  as used in their home countries. Interestingly, some s adapted their   due to their perceptions of changed circumstances within the host country. Other s, who would normally be authoritative, became trustful due to their perceived lack of educational expertise to guide their . Conversely, some other s who would normally be authoritarian employed wily tactics in influencing their 's decision, so as to circumvent the strict Australian legal framework around 's rights. Irrespective of   applied, all the s aimed to either guide or direct their 's educational and career development to ensure that they become economically productive adults. From the discourse of the SSA migrants' perceptions of their al role, we offer potential explanations for what underpins their  preferences and the rippling effects on their 's career trajectories. Direction for areas of continued  are ed, and implications of the findings are discussed."

Parental attachment style: examination of links with parent secure base provision and adolescent secure base use,2014,"The secure base construct res one of attachment theory's most important contributions to our understanding of - relationships and  development. The   res the first examination of how s' self-reported attachment  relate to al secure base provision and adolescent (mean age = 16.6 years, SE = .59) secure base use during an observed -adolescent interaction. Further, the   is the first to examine how fathers', as well as mothers', attachment  relate to observed behavior in a - interaction. At the bivariate level, maternal avoidance, but not anxiety, was negatively associated with observed adolescent secure base use. In addition, path analysis revealed that maternal avoidance was indirectly related to less adolescent secure base use through mothers' self-reported hostile behavior toward their adolescents and through adolescents' less positive perceptions of their mothers. Further, paternal anxiety, but not avoidance, was indirectly related to less adolescent secure base use through fathers' self-reported hostile behavior toward their adolescents. No significant findings emerged in relation to al secure base provision. We discuss these  in the context of attachment theory and suggest directions for future ."
The relationship between maternal attitudes and young people's attitudes toward 's rights,2006,"Relations between maternal socio-political attitudes and   and young people's and mothers' attitudes toward Young people's nurturance and self-determination rights were examined. Both young people (n = 121) and mothers (n = 67) were more Supportive of nurturance than self-determination rights, although Young people were more Supportive than their mothers of self-determination rights and mothers were more supportive than young people of nurturance rights. Maternal conservatism was unrelated to young people's support for rights and negatively related to mothers' support for both types of rights. Last, young people who perceived their mother to be either authoritarian or Uninvolved showed stronger endorsement of self-determination rights than young people who perceived their mother to be authoritative. The implications of these findings for the development of young people's attitudes toward rights within the context of various family factors are discussed. In particular, it is suggested that a balance needs to be achieved between assertion of rights and a respect for the rights of others.

Paternal parenting and depressive symptoms among adolescents: A moderated mediation model of deviant peer affiliation and school climate,2020,"As fathers become more involved in , more attention has been paid to the association between paternal  and adolescent depression. Based on Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory and attachment theory, we explored the mediating role of deviant peer affiliation and the moderating role of school climate in the relation between paternal  and depression. A total of 1177 Chinese adolescents were assessed with the questionnaires regarding , depression, deviant peer affiliation and school climate. After controlling for maternal , paternal  was negatively associated with depression. Deviant peer affiliation mediated the association between paternal  and depression. The association between deviant peer affiliation and depression was moderated by school climate, as the effect was stronger among adolescents with positive school climate than those with negative school climate. These findings may help to intervene and reduce adolescent depression."

The majority of the participants experienced traumatic events during hood and came from dysfunctional families. There appears to be a significant disconnect between these individuals and their families. An obedience-instilling   and s' knowledge and attitude toward drug using and prevention were  identified as important determinants of substance use. Discussion and Conclusions. The  of this  point out the need for early interventions for at-risk families as well as at-risk individuals.[Mirlashari J, Demirkol A, Salsali M, Rafiey H, Jahanbani J.

Intergenerational Transmissions of Mother-Adolescent Smartphone Dependency: The Mediating Role of Negative Parenting and the Moderating Role of Gender,2020,"Given the prevalence and undesirable consequences of smartphone dependency among adolescents, it is necessary to explore the influencing factors of adolescent smartphone dependency. The aim of this  was to examine the intergenerational transmission of mother-adolescent smartphone dependency and the mediating role of negative , moderated by adolescent gender. Data for 2541 middle school students (mean aged = 13 years)-mother dyads were obtained from the first wave of the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey 2018 (KCYPS 2018). The moderated mediation model using Hayes PROCESS macro (Model 14) was employed to test the  hypothesis. The moderated mediation model revealed that maternal smartphone dependency was associated with adolescent smartphone dependency. Perceived negative  mediated this link and adolescent gender moderated the relationship between negative  and adolescent smartphone dependency, especially for adolescent girls. Our findings showed that both maternal smartphone dependency and negative  were determinants of adolescent smartphone dependency, suggesting that both factors were important for understanding these issues. Moreover, the mediating role of negative  (between maternal and adolescent smartphone dependency) implies that al education programs designed to improve negative  may reduce adolescent smartphone dependency, especially for adolescent girls."
Emotional Intelligence Profiles in College Students and Their Fathers' and Mothers' Parenting Practices,2018,"The   has two objectives: first, to analyze whether the dimensions that make up emotional intelligence (attention, clarity, and repair) give rise to different profiles of university students, and secondly, to determine whether these different profiles are differentially associated with the  practices that students report with regard to their fathers and mothers. Results obtained indicate the existence of different profiles of college students. The profile that corresponds to adequate emotional skills s a lower score in attention, but higher scores in clarity, and especially in mood repair. The other two profiles are inadequate, in the first case because a higher score in emotional attention is accompanied by low scores in mood repair, and in the second case because low scores are ed in all three dimensions. Likewise, we verified the existence of significant differences in the educational practices of s, the adequate profile is characterized by greater use of  dimensions considered to be positive, and at the same time, lower scores on dimensions considered to be negative. One of the dysfunctional profiles is associated with higher scores in positive practices, and is  associated with higher scores in practices considered to produce a negative effect. The second dysfunctional profile is associated with higher scores on the dimensions considered to be negative and lower scores on positive dimensions."
Warm and Supportive Parenting Can Discourage Offspring's Civic Engagement in the Transition to Adulthood,2016,"It is widely believed that warm and supportive  fosters all kinds of prosocial behaviors in the offspring, including civic engagement. However, accumulating international evidence suggests that the effects of family support on civic engagement may sometimes be negative. To address this ap controversy, we identified several scenarios for the negative effects of supportive  on youth civic engagement and tested them using four waves of data from the Finnish Educational Transitions Studies. They followed 1549 students (55 % female) from late adolescence into young adulthood, included both maternal (n = 231) and offspring reports of al support, and assessed civic engagement in young adulthood. Control variables included socioeconomic status, other sociodemographic indicators, church belonging, personality traits, and earlier civic engagement. Higher maternal warmth and support and a stronger identification with the al family in adolescence predicted offspring's lower political activism up to 10 years later. Perceived al support in young adulthood predicted lower volunteering 2 years later. There were no significant effects on general organizational involvement (e.g., in student and hobby associations). None of the a priori scenarios that we identified from the literature appeared to explain the pattern of  satisfactorily. We put forth cultural and life stage explanations of our findings."
Relationship of connected and separate knowing to parental style and birth order,2000,"A total of 249 primarily middle-class, Caucasian college students (141 females, 108 males) completed the Knowing Styles Inventory (KSI) (Knight, Elfenbein, & Messina, 1995) to measure Connected and Separate Knowing and the al Authority Questionnaire (PAQ) (Buri, 1991), used to measure different   (authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive ). Authoritative   of the mother was positively associated with Connected Knowing, while authoritative   of the father was negatively related to Separate Knowing for both the female and male participants of the . For the female participants only, permissive   of the father was positively related to Separate Knowing. Ir was  found that first-born college students scored significantly higher on Separate knowing than later-born students. The  suggest that family experiences may be precursors to the epistemologies of college students."
Machine learning-based ability to classify psychosis and early stages of disease through parenting and attachment-related variables is associated with social cognition,2021,"Background: Recent views posited that negative  and attachment insecurity can be considered as general environmental factors of vulnerability for psychosis, specifically for individuals diagnosed with psychosis (PSY). Furthermore, evidence highlighted a tight relationship between attachment  and social cognition abilities, a key PSY behavioral phenotype. The aim of this  is to generate a machine learning algorithm based on the perceived quality of  and attachment -related features to discriminate between PSY and healthy controls (HC) and to investigate its ability to track PSY early stages and risk conditions, as well as its association with social cognition performance. Methods: Perceived maternal and paternal , as well as attachment anxiety and avoidance scores, were trained to separate 71 HC from 34 PSY (20 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia + 14 diagnosed with bipolar disorder with psychotic manifestations) using support vector classification and repeated nested cross-validation. We then validated this model on independent datasets including individuals at the early stages of disease (ESD, i.e. first episode of psychosis or depression, or at-risk mental state for psychosis) and with familial high risk for PSY (FHR, i.e. having a first-degree relative suffering from psychosis). Then, we performed factorial analyses to test the group x classification rate interaction on emotion perception, social inference and managing of emotions abilities. Results: The perceived  and attachment-based machine learning model discriminated PSY from HC with a Balanced Accuracy (BAC) of 72.2%. Slightly lower classification performance was measured in the ESD sample (HC-ESD BAC = 63.5%), while the model could not discriminate between FHR and HC (BAC = 44.2%). We observed a significant group x classification interaction in PSY and HC from the discovery sample on emotion perception and on the ability to manage emotions (both p = 0.02). The interaction on managing of emotion abilities was replicated in the ESD and HC validation sample (p = 0.03). Conclusion: Our  suggest that  and attachment-related variables bear significant classification power when applied to both PSY and its early stages and are associated with variability in emotion processing. These variables could therefore be useful in psychosis early recognition programs aimed at softening the psychosis-associated disability."
"Parenting, Temperament, and Attachment Security as Antecedents of Political Orientation: Longitudinal Evidence From Early Childhood to Age 26",2020,"This article examines early hood antecedents of adults' political orientation. Using longitudinal data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, we investigate associations between  beliefs and behaviors,  temperament, and attachment security during early hood in relation to adult political ideology and party affiliation at age 26 years (N = 1,364). Young 's fearful temperament and anxious attachment security, as well as mothers' authoritarian  beliefs in early hood, predicted conservative political orientations at age 26. Children's abilities to focus attention and avoidant attachment security predicted liberal orientations. These findings provide evidence that multiple aspects of early developmental experience-temperament, , and infant-mother attachment-are associated with later political orientations."
"Extracurricular activities, Positive parenting and Positive Adolescent Personal Development. Differential relationships through age and academic trajectories",2020,"Introduction. Positive  and Extracurricular Activities are contextual assets for enhancing Personal Positive Youth Development. However, these assets have not been studied simultaneously or in students of different ages. This paper analyzed these associations, by testing a mediator model in students with different academic trajectories. Method. The sample was composed by 1.402 adolescents, aged between 12 and 20 years (Mean=14.40; SD=1.910; males=49%). Students completed various questionnaires regarding the personal constructs of Optimism, Hope, General Self-efficacy and Sense of Coherence, as well as questionnaires that address perceptions of  Style and Extracurricular Activities. A random sampling was carried out by schools in Aragon (Spain) that offered the degrees carried out by adolescents. Results. Structural equation modeling showed that Positive  was associated with the accomplishment of Extracurricular Activities and personality constructs. Further, participation in activities was associated with the same pattern of personality traits (Expectancies, Self, and Sense of Coherence). These  were found mainly in younger students (12-15 years old), while in older students (16-20 years old) this effect was found only for those with a profile of less successful academic pathways. Discussion and Conclusion. Relationships with family are the essential asset for adolescents, especially to promote Personal Positive Youth Development, but  for the engagement in Extracurricular Activities. Implications for developmental psychologists, practitioners and educators are discussed, especially underscoring the importance of offering extracurricular opportunities."
Parenting practices and adolescent smoking in mainland China: The mediating effect of smoking-related cognitions,2014,"This  examined the direct and indirect associations of general and smoking-specific  practices with Chinese adolescents' smoking behaviors. Adolescents aged 14 -17 years (N = 658) and their s were recruited from three high schools in mainland China. Adolescents completed an anonymous online survey on their smoking behaviors, perceptions of  behaviors, and smoking-related cognitions including attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. s completed a paper-and-pencil questionnaire on their  behaviors. Results indicated that psychological control and frequency of communication about smoking were positively linked to adolescent smoking through the mediation of two smoking-related cognitions attitude and subjective norm. al knowledge of adolescent activities, disapproval of adolescent smoking, and home rules were negatively linked to adolescent smoking through the mediation of attitude and subjective norm. Results suggest that  practices and smoking-related cognitions are critical components to be incorporated in prevention and intervention programs for adolescent smoking in China.

'Speak roughly to your little boy'? Sex differences in the relations between parenting and preschoolers' understanding of mind,1999,"The  stud) explores relations between young 's understanding of mind and al emotional expression and disciplinary , along with gender differences in these relations. Participants were recruited from a  of 125 same-sex twin-pairs (58% female, group mean age = 43 months, SD = 1 month). Each  received a comprehensive set of theory-of-mind tasks, and was filmed at home for 20 minutes in dyadic interactions with the primary categories, who was  interviewed about disciplinary strategies. Ratings of discipline and positive and negative al affect and control were made from direct observation, from the interview and from the videoed interactions. Strong correlations were found between family SES,  measures, and  verbal re and theory-of-mind score. However, regression analyses showed that al behaviours were significant predictors of 's theory-of-mind performance, even when sex, verbal IQ and family SES were taken into account. Sex differences in these relations were  identified; al affect,vas especially salient for understanding of mind in girls, while discipline was more salient for boys. Taken together, these findings highlight the importance of individual differences in the proximal processes associated with early understanding of mind, and suggest that development in mental-state awareness is associated with distinct aspects of  for girls and boys."
Importance of Maternal Persistence in Young Children's Persistence,2021,"Persistence of a distant goal is an important personality trait that determines academic and social success. Recent studies have shown that individual differences in persistence involve both genetic and environmental factors; however, these studies have not examined the role of maternal factors on a young 's persistence. The   examined whether mothers' persistence is associated with persistence in  aged 3-6 years. In addition, the associations between mothers' persistence/  and 's self-control/social development (prosocial behaviors and difficulties) were examined. Our  showed that maternal persistence is essential for the 's persistence. Children's self-control and social development were  associated with the mothers' persistence and  .

Relations of sociotropy and autonomy to developmental experiences among psychiatric patients,2002,"This  investigated the relations of self-reported hood trauma and negative   to current levels of sociotropy and autonomy in a sample of 77 adult psychiatric inpatients. Controlling for depression symptoms, sociotropy was not significantly related to any of the  or trauma variables. Autonomy was related most strongly to emotional abuse and was  related to physical abuse, lack of al care, and al overprotection. Regression analyses controlling for depression and several other hood variables indicated that emotional abuse was significantly related to sociotropy, while emotional abuse and lack of al care were associated with autonomy. Sexual abuse, witnessing violence, emotional neglect, physical neglect, and loss were not found to be significant predictors of sociotropy or autonomy in these regression analyses. Results suggest that certain developmental experiences, particularly emotional abuse, are associated with sociotropy and autonomy and perhaps may contribute to the formation of these personality ."
The Longitudinal Influence of Parenting and Parents' Traces on Narrative Identity in Young Adulthood,2021,"This longitudinal follow-up studied continued effects of al influences on narrative identity in young adulthood.

Yet,  on long-term influences of  on narrative indices in adulthood is scarce, even though s' traces remain a part of narrative identity throughout the life span (Kober & Habermas, 2018). Therefore, in this , 118 individuals (at time 1: M-age = 17.3 years, SD = .77, 73% female, 82% White) reported at age 17 on their perceived positive . As emerging and young adults, as part of follow-ups at ages 26 and again at 32, participants provided life story interviews. First, it was tested whether earlier positive  longitudinally predicted s' traces in later life stories. Second, we studied the joint long-term prediction of  and s' traces to several narrative features of these young adults' life stories, including emotional tone, coherent positive resolution, and narrative complexity. Results replicated prior  on s' traces and showed moreover that perceived  shape offspring's narrative identity well into young adulthood. These long-term findings are consistent with the notion that narrative identity in adulthood is rooted in the family, and continuously shaped by experiences with s."
Social competence of 3 to 5-year-old  born with low birth weight,2015,"Background Low birth weight (LBW) has long been used as an indicator of public health. Low birth weight is not a proxy for any dimension of other maternal or perinatal health outcomes. Low birth weight infants require special care, and have more chronic conditions, learning delays, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders compared to infants of normal birth weight (NBW). Social competence is viewed as a primary component of healthy function and development and is an important predictor of academic and financial success. Objective To examine social competence of  aged 3-5 years born with low birth weight. Methods This cross-sectional  was undertaken in Palembang in 2012. Subjects consisted of  aged 3-5 years attended a preschool in the Seberang Ulu I District, Palembang, and were divided into two groups: low birth weight (LBW) and normal birth weight (NBW). Social competence was assessed by observation and Interaction Rating Scale (IRS) and  Style questionnaire (PSQ). Chi-square analysis was used to compare social competence between the two groups. Multivariate regression logistic analysis was used to assess for the dominant factors that may affect a 's social competence. Results Low birth weight  aged 3 to 5 years had a 1.435 times higher risk of low social competence compared to normal birth weight  of similar age. (RP 1.435; 95% CI 1.372 to 13.507; P=0.019). Multivariate regression logistic analysis revealed that   was a dominant factor affecting social competence. Conclusion Social competence in 3 to 5-year-old  born with low birth weight is lower compared to those with normal birth weight."
Emotion Socialization Style in Parents of Children with Callous-Unemotional Traits,2014,"Children with callous-unemotional (CU) traits manifest a range of deficits in their emotional functioning, and s play a key role in socializing 's understanding, experience, expression, and regulation of emotions. However,  examining emotion-related  in families of  with CU traits is scarce. In two independent studies we examined emotion socialization  in s of  high on CU traits. In Study 1, we assessed s' self-reported beliefs and feelings regarding their own and their 's emotions, in a sample of 111 clinic-referred and community  aged 7-12 years. In Study 2, we directly observed s' responding to  emotion during an emotional reminiscing task, in a clinic sample of 59 conduct-problem  aged 3-9 years. Taken together, the  were consistent in suggesting that the mothers of  with higher levels of CU traits are more likely to have affective attitudes that are less accepting of emotion (Study 1), and emotion socialization practices that are more dismissing of  emotion (Study 2). Fathers' emotion socialization beliefs and practices were unrelated to levels of CU traits. Our findings provide initial evidence for a relationship between CU traits and s' emotion socialization , and have significant implications for the design of novel family-based interventions targeting CU traits and co-occurring conduct problems."

The relationship of psychosocial maturity to parenting quality and intellectual ability for American and Korean adolescents,1998,"Psychosocial maturity, gender, intellectual ability, and  practices were examined with a group of 344 Korean and 214 American adolescents. American adolescents reported greater self-reliance, work-orientation, and self-identity than did Korean adolescents. In addition, American girls described themselves as more mature in work orientation than did American boys, a trend reversed in the Korean culture. Intellectual ability was associated with adolescents' psychosocial maturity. Differences in   were predictive of psychosocial maturity regardless of ethnic group membership.

Parenting and Teacher-Student Relationship as Protective Factors for Chinese Adolescent Adjustment During COVID-19,,"COVID-19 negatively impacts students' learning as well as physical and mental health. This  examined the effects of perceived online learning difficulties and cyberbullying on academic engagement and mental health, and if   and student-teacher relationship moderated these relations among 733 middle school students (54.3% boys) and their s (M-age = 44.76 years, SD = 4.13 years, 28.1% fathers and 71.9% mothers) from Beijing, China. Results suggested that perceived online learning difficulties and cyberbullying predicted more mental health difficulties; perceived difficulties with online learning negatively predicted academic engagement. Authoritative  and positive student-teacher relationship predicted more academic engagement and less mental health difficulties, while authoritarian  predicted more mental health difficulties. Student-teacher relationship  moderated the relation between cyberbullying and mental health as well as difficulties with online learning and academic engagement. s and adolescents wanted more interactions with teachers and group activities to foster peer relationships, and more support from teachers and school psychologists to address students' social and emotional needs during COVID-19. Implications for school psychologists and school staff are discussed. Impact Statement A majority of Chinese middle school students in our sample experienced difficulties with distance learning during COVID-19, which was negatively related to their academic engagement (e.g., active participation in class) and mental health. This is one of the first studies to highlight the importance of two protective factors (authoritative  and positive student-teacher relationships) on student academic engagement and mental health during COVID-19. The findings highlight important implications for school staff (teachers and school psychologists) and provide suggestions on how to better support adolescents in the online learning environment during the COVID-19."
Strength-based parenting and social-emotional wellbeing in Turkish young people: does school belonging matter?,,"Objective: While a link between strength-based  and social-emotional wellbeing has been previously established, little is known about the role that school belonging plays in moderating this relationship. The   examined the mediating and moderating role of school belonging in the association of strength-based  with social-emotional wellbeing among young people Method: The current  surveyed 343 students in grades 6-8 from Turkey, using the Strength-Based  scale, Social and Emotional Health Survey-Primary, and School Belongingness Scale. Results: Mediation analyses showed that strength-based  predicted school belonging, gratitude, zest, optimism, and persistence and that school belonging mediated the effect of strength-based  on social-emotional wellbeing. Moderation analysis identified the predictive impact of strength-based  on student social-emotional wellbeing, only for those whose belonging was low to moderate. Conclusions: Overall, these  indicate the importance of school belonging on youth social-emotional wellbeing in the context of al experiences. Discussed are the implications of the current  that can inform the policy and practice. KEY POINTS What is already known about this topic: (1) Strength-based  is an essential positive psychological construct for youth mental health and wellbeing. (2) School belonging is associated with various school-based and quality of life outcomes, and a satisfied need for belonging in school foster youth social-emotional health. (3) The strongest predictors of school belonging are teacher support and positive personal characteristics; however, it is recommended that schools actively engage s in fostering their 's school belonging. What this topic adds: (1) The   emphasizes the importance of strength-based  strategies targeting to promote social-emotional wellbeing in school settings. (2) School belonging is an essential mechanism that may help to understand the effect of strength-based  on social-emotional wellbeing among young people. (3) The   suggest there is a need to design more comprehensive strategies for improving adolescent mental health and wellbeing."
"The relationship between COVID-related parenting stress, nonresponsive feeding behaviors, and parent mental health",,"COVID-19 has disrupted the lives of families across the United States and all over the world. Stress is known to have a negative impact on - feeding interactions; hence, the purpose of this  is to examine how COVID-related  stress, which was measured using a newly developed scale, is related to  mental health, nonresponsive feeding, and 's self-regulation of eating. 119 s of  ages 2-7 years old filled out questions about COVID-related  stress, mental health, nonresponsive feeding behaviors, and 's self-regulation of eating. A series of multiple regressions were run to predict  anxiety and psychological distress from COVID-related  stress. COVID-related  stress was found to be a significant predictor of both  anxiety and psychological distress. When COVID-related  stress was further broken down into COVID-Related Job/Financial Security Stress and COVID-Related Family Safety/Stability Stress, COVID-Related Job/Financial Security Stress predicted psychological distress while COVID-Related Family Safety/Stability Stress predicted  anxiety. Moderation analyses were  run to test the difference across the s of  under 5 years of age and those of  who were 5 years of age and older regarding the association of COVID-related  stress and either  anxiety or psychological distress. There was no significant difference across age. Lastly, COVID-related  stress and nonresponsive feeding practices were simultaneously entered into a multiple regression to predict 's self-regulation of eating, and COVID-related  stress and  distrust in appetite were both found to decrease 's ability to self-regulate energy intake. Based on findings from this , ers interested in improving 's self-regulation of eating and long-term health outcomes should continue to target the reduction of nonresponsive  feeding behaviors, but they should  aim to look beyond specific  feeding behaviors by attempting to help s manage stressors in their lives."
Can Family Patterns Help Adolescents Establish Intimate Social Relationships with Peers?,,"The current  examines how the family patterns of differentiation of self and   impact the level of intimacy in same- and cross-sex friendships among Arab adolescents in Israel. 150 adolescents responded to the Differentiation of Self Inventory, al Authority Questionnaire, and the Intimate Friendship Questionnaire. The findings indicate that high levels of I-position, indicating good communication between family members in Arab households in Israel, together with an authoritative  , may promote intimacy in friendships with the same sex, whereas fused and dense relationships may reduce intimacy in cross-sex friendships."
Behavioral and environmental correlates of infant abuse in group-living pigtail macaques,1998,"The   investigated the context of occurrence of infant abuse and the behavior of abusive mothers and their infants in pigtail macaques (Macaca nemestrina). Subjects were 8 abusive mothers with their infants and 8 control mother-infant pairs living in 3 captive social groups. The most common forms of abuse were infant crushing and dragging and the most common context of occurrence was social stress. Severe and mild abuse differed in the frequency but not in the type of abuse patterns. Abusive mothers had controlling   relative to nonabusive mothers, and abused infants played at a later age and less frequently than controls. This  replicates previous findings on the   of abusive macaque mothers and provides new evidence on the context of occurrence of abuse and its consequences far infant health and social development."
MOTHERS AND FATHERS OF YOUNG-CHILDREN - COMPARISON OF PARENTING STYLES,1991,
Parenting Behaviors and Their Relationship With Alcohol Involvement in Mexican Teenagers and Young Adults,2018,"This  aimed to identify relationships between perceived  behaviors and alcohol involvement in Mexican teenagers and young adults. Egna Minnen Betraffande Uppfostran (EMBU-I) and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) questionnaires were administered to 276 students from technical schools. Lifetime prevalence of alcohol use was 76.1%. Findings revealed that higher perception of  behaviors (rejection and overprotection) was significantly related to higher involvement with alcohol. Those  were consistent in men. Results suggest that al rejection and overprotection, as well as sex of the offspring, are key elements that must be studied extensively among youths in order to justify preventive strategies toward reducing alcohol use in Mexico."
Keeping it together for the kids: New mothers' descriptions of the impact of intimate partner violence on parenting,2020,"Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) affects 1 in 3 US women with the effects of IPV detectable for several generations. While IPV is known to have significant impacts on maternal- outcomes, little is known about the mother's perspectives of the interplay between perinatal IPV exposure,  , and safety strategies. Methods: This secondary analysis of semi-structured, longitudinal qualitative interview data explored with pregnant women their histories of IPV, their  practices, and safety strategies. Data were derived from a randomized controlled trial, DOVE, with 22 interviews from 11 women collected during pregnancy and 12 or 24 months postpartum. Results: Data were analyzed using constant comparative analysis ing in three themes: broken spirit, I want better for my kids and me, and safety planning as an element of . Women described at baseline having a broken spirit due to their experiences with household and family chaos and hood abuse. However, when mothers ended the abusive relationship, they described a better life and several strategies to protect themselves and their . During their final interviews, mothers discussed how their lives improved after ending the relationship as well as safety planning strategies they employed like looking for red flags in potential partners, struggles with finding trustworthy care, and stockpiling money should they choose to end the relationship. Conclusion: These rich data add new information about how mothers of very young  navigate difficult  and safety decisions in the context of lifetime traumatic events and provide insights relevant for practice and  with this highly-vulnerable group of IPV survivors."
The impact of adolescent and parental characteristics on adolescent levels of delinquency and depression,2004,"Using a cross-sectional design, we examined the effects of adolescent and al characteristics on depression and delinquency among a sample of Australian high school students. The sample comprised 276 students (median age= 15 years) and 274 biological s of these students. The characteristics measured included adolescent reports of their personality and perceptions of al bonding as well as al reports of their own   and personality. As expected, depression and delinquency scores were significantly correlated, although the significant predictors of these outcome measures were found to be quite distinct. Adolescent personality scores were the strongest predictors of the outcome measures, although fathers' personality and   were  found to be implicated in adolescent adjustment. These  are discussed with reference to previous work in this area. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
A preliminary investigation of parenting attributes of Australian foster carers,2005,"Utilising a comparison  design of mothers involved in fostering (N = 28) and their peers (N = 28), the major findings were that within the fostering group, those who had been fostering the longest had the lowest sense of efficacy, reflecting that the experience of providing foster care eroded s' sense of their own skill. In terms of attachment to the , the data suggested that foster carers may resist becoming too close to the  in their care in order to limit the emotional cost of subsequent separation. Importantly, there was no significant correlation between the length of time in providing foster care and marital satisfaction, which supports the notion that providing foster care does not, in itself, cause marital stress. While formal support services were more utilised by foster carers there was some indication that this group is not well integrated into the broader community. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that over the long-term providing fostering care has some negative consequences for the carers in terms of their self-confidence. Agencies designated to work with carers need to consider proactive strategies to reduce this consequence."
Parenting Attributions and Attitudes in Cross-Cultural Perspective,2011,"Objective. This article used the  Across Cultures Project to evaluate similarities and differences in mean levels and relative agreement between mothers' and fathers' attributions and attitudes in  in 9 countries. Design. Mothers and fathers reported their perceptions of causes of successes and failures in caregiving and their progressive versus authoritarian rearing attitudes. Gender and cultural similarities and differences in s' attributions and attitudes in 9 countries were analyzed: China, Colombia, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, the Philippines, Sweden, Thailand, and the United States. Results. Although mothers and fathers did not differ in any attribution, mothers reported more progressive  attitudes and modernity of rearing attitudes than did fathers, and fathers reported more authoritarian attitudes than did mothers. Country differences  emerged in all attributions and attitudes that were examined. Mothers' and fathers' attributions and their attitudes were moderately correlated, but  attitudes were more highly correlated in s than were attributions. Conclusions. We draw connections among the findings across the 9 countries and outline implications for understanding similarities and differences in mothers' and fathers'  attributions and attitudes."
The impact of feedback valence and communication style on intrinsic motivation in middle hood: Experimental evidence and generalization across individual differences,2018,"Prior  among adolescents and emerging adults has provided evidence for the beneficial effects of positive (relative to negative) feedback and an autonomy-supportive (relative to a controlling) communication  on students' intrinsic motivation. Unfortunately, similar experimental  in middle hood is lacking. Moreover, little attention has been paid to the question of whether individual differences in personality and perceived  play a role in these effects. In the current experimental  (N =110; M-age = 10.71 years),  completed puzzles at school under one of four experimental conditions, thereby crossing normative feedback valence (i.e., positive vs. negative) with communication  (i.e., autonomy supportive vs. controlling). Prior to the experiment,  filled out questionnaires tapping into the Big Five personality traits and into perceived maternal autonomy support and psychological control. After the experimental induction,  rated several motivational constructs (i.e., intrinsic motivation and need-based experiences). In addition, their voluntary behavioral persistence in a subsequent challenging puzzle task was recorded objectively. Providing positive normative feedback in an autonomy-supportive way yielded the most favorable motivational outcomes. Both feedback valence and communication  yielded an independent impact on 's experiences of competence and autonomy during task engagement, which in turn helped to explain 's elevated intrinsic motivation, as reflected by their perceived interest and behavioral persistence. A few effects were moderated by 's perceived  and personality traits, but the number of interactions was limited. The discussion focuses on the motivating role of positive normative feedback and an autonomy-supportive communication  for . (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Actor and partner effects of parenting stress and co-parenting on marital conflict among parents of  with atopic dermatitis,2020,"Background It is important for healthcare providers to pay attention to s' rearing  and 's physical symptoms to promote a healthy quality of life among  with atopic dermatitis. We aimed to identify effects of  stress and co- on marital conflict among s of  with atopic dermatitis. Methods Participants were 161 fathers and 161 mothers raising seven-year-old  treated for atopic dermatitis. To confirm the effects of  stress and co- on marital conflict, the actor-partner interdependence mediation model was used. To verify goodness-of-fit, maximum likelihood method was used, and a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to confirm the validity of latent variables for model analysis. Results Fathers'  stress had actor (beta = -.46, p < .001) and partner (beta = -.22, p < .001) effects on co-, and mothers'  stress had actor (beta = -.20, p < .001) and partner (beta = -.36, p < .001) effects on co-. Fathers'  stress only had an actor effect on marital conflict (beta = .32, p < .001). Father's co- had actor (beta = -.29, p < .001) and partner (beta = -.22, p < .001) effects on marital conflict, and mothers' co- had actor (beta = -.39, p < .001) and partner (beta = -.19, p < .001) effects on marital conflict. There were significant differences between the two groups concerning three path coefficients: fathers'  stress affected fathers' marital conflict, fathers' co- affected fathers' marital conflict, and mothers' co- affected fathers' marital conflict. Conclusions It is vital for healthcare providers to seek ways to reduce the marital conflicts of s of  with atopic dermatitis, including further examination of the role of co-, to address 's physical symptoms and promote their health. Our findings inform management and intervention programs for the families of  with atopic dermatitis."
Co-parenting and feeding in early hood: Reflections of parent dyads on how they manage the developmental stages of feeding over the first three years,2016,"Family-level influences on the development of healthy eating behaviors start in infancy and toddlerhood with how families manage developmental stages of feeding. Little  on home feeding environments for young  has examined how mothers and fathers collaborate around feeding issues or contribute jointly to feeding. The purpose of this qualitative  is to examine co- with regard to infant/toddler feeding practices. Twenty-four sets of co-resident, biological s with a  between 6 months and 3 years were interviewed together about their feeding practices and how they discussed and collaborated on feeding during the main stages of feeding development in the first three years. Analyses illuminate themes related to how specific domains of co- (satisfaction with labor, support, agreement, conflict) factor into infant and toddler feeding as well as how additional factors such as having older  and employment schedules shape how both food  practices and co- are managed in relation to feeding. Mothers were the primary managers of feeding labor. Fathers participated in feeding in different ways and levels starting in infancy and increased involvement in feeding over the first few years requiring an ongoing negotiation around co- related to feeding. Overall, this  develops insights into how multiple caregivers construct a family environment specifically related to early feeding a perspective missing from current conceptualizations of home feeding environment. Attention to the concept of co- within home feeding environments should help inform more effective approaches to intervene with families on issues around hood obesity and family health.

"Parenting self-construals of mothers with a serious mental illness: Efficacy, burden, and personal growth",2004,"We explored  self-construals among mothers with serious mental illness (n = 379). Mothers reported feeling moderately positively about themselves as s. more efficacious than inefficacious, more positive than negative. more valued than disvalued; but  at least somewhat restricted and burdened by motherhood. Factor analyses revealed 3  self-construal factors: efficacious, burdened, and  as a personal growth experience. In hierarchical regression analyses,  self-construal factors significantly added to prediction of  behaviors and attitudes (nurturance, explanatory  , and  stress), once demographic, mental health history, and current social context variables (support, stress, and cut-rent mental health),were taken into account. Maternal  self-efficacy increased (while self-construal of  as a burden decreased) positive  ."
Parenting practices and the transmission of ethnic identity,2003,"Three years after being interviewed, a nonrandom, purposeful subsample of 14 Jewish families from a larger sample of 48 families living in Central New York was reinterviewed. The primary aim of this follow-up  was to develop a descriptive understanding of  practices and the transmission of ethnic identity. Semistructured family interviews were conducted and coded using grounded-theory techniques, in particular the constant comparative method of analysis. Four main qualitative categories emerged from this : Individual differences in teenagers, stages of ethnic identity development,  practices, and al role models. Findings suggest that clear expectations, a type of authoritative , could be associated with the positive transmission of Jewish ethnic identity. This type of   was direct as s expressed clear expectations for participation in Jewish activities both at home and in the community."
Seeking balance between the past and the present: Vietnamese refugee parenting practices and adolescent well-being,2012,"This qualitative  examines the resources that Vietnamese refugee s use in raising their adolescent youth in exile and how they, and their adolescents, regard their experiences of different  . The  is based on 55 semi-structured interviews and several focus groups performed with a small sample of Vietnamese refugee s and their adolescent . Three main themes from the interviews were identified: the role of the extended family and siblings in bringing up ; language acquisition and cultural continuity and, finally, religion and social support. Our findings suggest extended kin are involved in the raising of adolescent , providing additional family ties and support. s regarded Vietnamese language acquisition by their youth as facilitating both communication with extended kin and cultural transmission. Several s stressed the importance of religious community to socializing and creating a sense of belonging for their youth. Vietnamese refugee s seek a balance between Vietnamese values and their close extended family social networks, and the opportunities in Norway to develop autonomy in pursuit of educational and economic goals. Together these  practices constituted a mobilization of resources in support of their youth. These findings may have important implications for future  on resiliency and the role of these strategies as protective factors mediating mental health outcomes. They may  have implications for treatment, in terms of the types of resources treatment can access and for prevention strategies that maximize key cultural resources for Vietnamese refugee youth.

Childless adults with higher secure attachment state have stronger parenting motivation,2015,"This  aimed to systematically examine the coherence in the motivation of  with the security attachment state of adults. A total of 228 less participants (126 men, 102 women) first completed a self-report questionnaire including the State Adult Attachment Measure scale and the Interest in Infants questionnaire. They were then administered three laboratory-based tasks: a) liking, which measured the specific hedonic experience to infants' neutral faces; b) reational responding (actively seeking infants' neutral faces); and c) evoked responding (actively retaining images of infants' neutral faces). The  revealed that after controlling for gender, anxiety, and avoidance, security attachment state was associated with higher levels of interest in infants, assessed via verbal measures, and associated with liking and wanting (divided into reational and evoked responding) for infants' neutral faces. Moreover, infant faces elicited pleasure but not the sense of dominance or wanting in individuals with high avoidance attachment state. These  suggest that improving security attachment state may enhance motivation for  and improve the quality of al caregiving. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Emotional eating: Really hungry or just angry?,2021,"The aim of this  was to investigate the effect of   and academic self-efficacy on emotional eating behaviours within a sample of adolescents. The sample of this cross-sectionally designed  consisted of 584 adolescents between the ages of 12-17 years. In order to collect necessary data, the Emotional Eating Scale for Child and Adolescent, the  Style Scale and Academic Self-efficacy Scale were utilized. In this sample, Emotional Eating Scale's total score of girls was higher than boys, and emotional eating was not related to body mass index.   and academic self-efficacy predicted 34% of the variants seen in emotional eating behaviours of adolescents. While a positive relation existed between emotional eating and negligent  , a negative significant relation occurred between permissive and democratic type of   and emotional eating. In addition, emotional eating behaviours decreased, whereas academic self-efficacy perception increased accordingly. The  showed that emotional eating behaviours of adolescents were in relation with   and academic self-efficacy. A good understanding of the multifactorial structure of emotional eating in adolescents will help to develop essential programmes in order to design effective coping mechanisms."
DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF A SHORT VERSION OF THE PARENTAL AUTHORITY QUESTIONNAIRE,2011,"A short version of Bun's (1991) 30-item al Authority Questionnaire (PAQ), a widely used measure of Baumrind's (1971) model of authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive  , has been developed in this . The participants were 3,025 middle and high school students from Oman. The sample was randomly divided into 2 subsamples. The first sample (N = 1,504) was used for the development of the short version, and the second sample (N = 1,521) served as the validation sample. The  indicate that a reduced 20-item PAQ fit the data better than the 30-item PAQ. The short version evidenced adequate validity and internal consistency.

Parent feeding restriction and  weight. The mediating role of  disinhibited eating and the moderating role of the parenting context,2009,"Objective: We had two aims in this  of  and young 's eating and weight. The first aim was to test whether the association of al restriction with young 's higher BMI is dependent on the intervening (i.e., mediating) role of their disinhibited eating. The second aim was to test how the  context may change the influence of  restriction on 's eating.  dimensions of supportiveness and structure were expected to attenuate the positive association between  restriction and  disinhibited eating, whereas  dimensions of coerciveness and chaos were expected to strengthen this association. Methods: Caregivers of  aged 4-8 years (N = 230, 48% female) completed questionnaires and 's height and weight were measured to calculate BMI z-scores. Structural equation modelling and hierarchical regression analyses were conducted. Results: Children's disinhibited eating partially mediated the association between  restriction and 's BMI. However, restriction was found to be directly associated with 's BMI, and this direct association was stronger than the indirect one. Associations between restriction and 's disinhibited eating differed depending on the  context in the feeding domain, including supportiveness, coerciveness and chaotic . (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

"The parenting sense of competence scale: Investigation of the factor structure, reliability, and validity for an Australian sample",2004,"Investigation of the factor structure of the  Sense of Competence Scale (PSOC) was conducted with an Australian sample of 849 mothers and 329 fathers. Two factors of Satisfaction and Efficacy were found that were largely consistent with previous . In addition, a third factor reflecting interest in the  role emerged. The Satisfaction factor was strongly correlated with measures of  behaviour,  wellbeing, and  . Efficacy and Interest showed few correlations with these variables.  and  gender were not related to factor scores and  age showed a small relationship with PSOC scores for very young . Use of the revised scale with separate scoring keys for mothers and fathers is recommended."
Parental Inconsistency: A Third Cross-Cultural Research on Parenting and Psychological Adjustment of Children,2010,"Inconsistency in  is a factor that may influence 's mental health. A questionnaire, measuring three al inconsistencies (temporal, situational, and father-mother inconsistency) was administered to adolescents in nine countries to assess its association with adolescents' psychological disorders. The  show that al inconsistency varies across cultures. Temporal inconsistency is not correlated with the other two inconsistencies. Temporal and father-mother inconsistencies, but not the situational inconsistency, were associated with adolescents' psychological disorders. The associations between al inconsistency and psychological disorders differed across cultures."
"Geographical Cues and Developmental Exposure Navigational Style, Wayfinding Anxiety, and Childhood Experience in the Faroe Islands",2016,"The current  assessed potential relationships among hood wayfinding experience, navigational , and adult wayfinding anxiety in the Faroe Islands. The Faroe Islands are of interest because they have an unusual geography that may promote the use of an orientational  of navigation (e.g., use of cardinal directions). Faroese adults completed questionnaires assessing (1) their permitted hood range sizes, (2) the types of navigational strategies they use, and (3) the amount of anxiety they experience when navigating in adulthood. Males had more hood wayfinding experience, used the orientation strategy at a higher rate, and showed lower levels of wayfinding anxiety. When compared with other cultures, both Faroese women and men appear to embrace orientation strategies at an unusually high rate. Childhood experience was not conclusively linked to later wayfinding anxiety. However, the current findings raise the possibility that  who have particularly small ranges in hood may be especially anxious when navigating in adulthood."

Impact of problematic eating behaviour and parental feeding styles on early hood caries,2020,"Background Eating behaviour in hood has been implicated in development of early hood caries.  feeding  can  contribute to development of various eating behaviours. Aim To evaluate relationship between 's eating behaviour and al feeding  with ECC in preschool . Design A case-control  was conducted in 440  who were selected and divided into 2 groups: Group A- with ECC and Group B- without ECC. Dental caries was recorded using dmft index. The s of  in both groups were requested to complete the Children's Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ) and al Feeding Style Questionnaire (PFQ). Results There was positive association of food avoidance subscales of CEBQ (Satiety Responsiveness, Food Fussiness, Slowness in Eating, and Emotional Undereating) along with certain food-approaching subscales (Desire to Drink and Emotional Overeating) with dental caries status. It was  seen that al feeding patterns such as Encouragement and Instrumental feeding contributed to decrease in dental caries of the  when compared to Control and Emotional feeding. Conclusion Certain eating and feeding behaviours can possibly be associated with development of ECC, such behaviours can be successfully identified using CEBQ and PFQ."
INSIGHT responsive parenting intervention and infant feeding practices: randomized clinical trial,2018,"Background: What, when, how, how much, and how often infants are fed have been associated with hood obesity risk. The objective of this secondary analysis was to examine the effect of a responsive  (RP) intervention designed for obesity prevention on s' infant feeding practices in the first year after birth. Methods: Primiparous mother-newborn dyads were randomized to the Intervention Nurses Start Infants Growing on Healthy Trajectories (INSIGHT) Study RP intervention or  safety control. Research nurses delivered intervention content at home at infant age 3-4, 16, 28, and 40 weeks, and at a  center at 1 year. RP feeding guidance advised feeding that was contingent (i.e., feed in response to hunger and satiety signs, alternatives to using food to soothe), and developmentally appropriate (i.e., delaying introduction of solids, age-appropriate portion sizes). Infant feeding practices (i.e., bottle use, introduction of solids, food to soothe) were assessed by phone interviews and online surveys and dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. Results: RP mothers were more likely to use of structure-based feeding practices including limit-setting (p < 0.05) and consistent feeding routines (p < 0.01) at age 1 year. RP group mothers were less likely to use non-responsive feeding practices such as pressuring their infant to finish the bottle/food (p < 0.001), and using food to soothe (p < 0.01), propping the bottle (p < 0.05) assessed between 4 and 8 months, and putting baby to bed with a bottle at age 1 year (p < 0.05). Few differences were seen between groups in what specific foods or food groups infants were fed. Conclusions: Anticipatory guidance on RP in feeding can prevent the use of food to soothe and promote use of more sensitive, structure-based feeding which could reduce obesity risk by affecting how and when infants are fed during the first year."
The Effects of Maternal and Paternal Helicopter Parenting on the Self-determination and Well-being of Emerging Adults,2019,"Objectives We examined gender differences in helicopter  and emerging adults' well-being through the basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Based on gender congruence theory, we hypothesized that daughters' well-being would be more adversely impacted by their mothers' helicopter  compared to fathers', while the opposite pattern would emerge for sons. Method Participants were 446 college students between 18-25 years old who completed an online survey. The majority of participants were white, female, underclassman from middle to upper-middle class families. Results Participants reported that their mothers engaged in more helicopter  than their fathers. Male and female participants did not differ in the amount of helicopter  they experienced, so we tested a model combining these sub-samples. Two minor differences were identified: Daughters reported maternal helicopter  was more strongly associated with decreased autonomy and sons reported paternal helicopter  was more strongly associated with a decreased relatedness. Thus, a partial equivalence model was tested with only these two paths free to vary between groups. Maternal helicopter  was indirectly associated with their 's reduced well-being on all three measures (i.e., anxiety, depression, and satisfaction with life) through a reduced sense of autonomy and competence. Paternal helicopter  was only indirectly associated with their offspring's well-being through autonomy. Conclusions Results supported prior  suggesting helicopter  adversely affects emerging adults' well-being through its negative impact on the basic psychological needs of self-determination. There was limited support for gender differences in the impact of helicopter  on emerging adults."
Child Feeding Style and Dietary Outcomes in a Cohort of Latino Farmworker Families,2018,"Background The high level of obesity in Latino , especially in farmworker families, may be partly attributed to feeding  of s. Feeding  used in Latino farmworker families have not been well characterized. Objective This  sought to identify and describe feeding  used by mothers in farmworker families with 2.5- to 3.5-year-old , describe how  change over time, and characterize the relationship of feeding  to dietary outcomes and measures of overweight and obesity. Design This was a longitudinal cohort , with families participating for a 2-year period; surveys were administered to mothers with varying frequency depending on the instrument, and dietary measurements were collected at baseline and 12 and 24 months. Participants/setting Eligible participants were self-identified Latino women with a coresident  aged 2.5 to 3.5 years old and at least one household member engaged in farm work during the previous year. The sample included 248 farmworker families enrolled between 2011 and 2012 in the Nifios Sanos , a longitudinal investigation of Latino mothers and their young  in rural North Carolina. Eleven families provided incomplete dietary data, so the analysis included 237 families. Fifteen families were lost to follow-up and 12 withdrew during the course of the . Main outcome measures Feeding  was assessed using items from the Caregiver's Feeding Style Questionnaire, selected dietary components were assessed using the Revised Children's Diet Quality Index, and weight outcomes were determined using body mass index-for-age percentile. Performance on the Caregiver's Feeding Style Questionnaire items was used to assign mothers to one of four feeding  states. Statistical analyses performed Exploratory factor analysis was conducted on baseline data to verify the replicability of the factor structure of the instrument Caregiver's Feeding Style Questionnaire. Hidden Markov Model analysis was used to delineate different subtypes of feeding . Multivariable mixed-effects regression models were used to assess the impact of feeding  on selected dietary components, energy intake, and body mass index-for-age percentile. Results Four distinct states emerged from the Hidden Markov Model: low -centered (PC)/moderate -centered (CC) feeding  (28% at baseline), high PC/ CC without physical control (24%), high PC/CC (26%), and moderate PC/CC (22%). The low PC/moderate CC state increased in prevalence over time. Compared to high PC/CC, the low PC/moderate CC state was associated with greater intake of added sugars (P<0.01), lower intake of whole grains and vegetables (P<0.01), and lower overall diet quality (P<0.05). Children in low PC/moderate CC  had higher mean body mass index percentiles (76.2 percentile vs 66.7 percentile in high PC/CC; P<0.001). Conclusions High PC feeding along with high CC feeding is associated with improved diet quality and weight outcomes for  in the ."
The relationship between parental food parenting practices &  eating behavior: A comparison of mothers and fathers,2021,"The objective of this  was to compare the relationships between food  practices and  eating behavior among mothers and fathers of young . This cross-sectional  recruited mothers (n = 127) and fathers (n = 118) of  (4.2 ? 1.3 years old) to complete surveys (face-to-face and online). Each  completed the Comprehensive Food  Questionnaire, Children?s Eating Behavior Questionnaire, and demographic questions. Linear regressions were used to compare the relationships between al food  practices and ?s eating behaviors with  sex as a moderator. Child age and sex served as control variables in each regression.  sex was a significant moderator in several relationships between  food  practices and  eating behavior. In the relationship between al restriction for health (? = -.14, p = .014) and monitoring (? = -.13, p = .028) and  slowness in eating, the slope of the interaction was significantly higher for mothers, meaning that when mothers and fathers use the same level of restriction for health and monitoring,  slowness in eating is higher for  of mothers. When mothers and fathers used the same level of restriction for weight,  food responsiveness (? = .13, p = .003) and emotional overeating (? = .12, p = .046) was significantly higher for  of fathers. There may be differences in how mothers and fathers implement food  practices and/or differences in how these practices impact . Specifically, for fathers, it seems that the use of restriction for weight is more detrimental for ?s eating behaviors compared to when mothers use the same level of restriction for weight."
Intergenerational Transmission of Perceived Bonding Styles and Paternal Emotion Socialization: Mediation Through Paternal Emotion Dysregulation,2016,"We examined perceived al , emotion socialization practices and emotion dysregulation among fathers from a community sample in order to understand the intergenerational transmission of normative  behaviors. The sample consisted of 217 fathers of school-age  ranging in age from 6 to 12 years. We used a cross-sectional design. The fathers completed a set of self-report questionnaires including al boding instrument, difficulties in emotion regulation scale, and coping with 's negative emotion scale. The findings indicated that fathers' perceived al care of their own s (G1) was negatively linked to fathers' (G2) non-supportive responses to negative emotions shown by their  (G3) through its negative association with the father's (G2) emotion regulation difficulties, whereas fathers' perceived al overprotection of their own s (G1) was positively linked to fathers' (G2) non-supportive responses to negative emotions shown by their  (G3) through its positive associations with the fathers' (G2) emotion regulation difficulties. The current  contributed to the further understanding of individual differences in fathers' emotion socialization practices. The findings potentially shed lights on prevention and intervention efforts regarding limiting the expansion of maladaptive emotional  behaviors across generations."
Parenting stress in mothers of  with congenital hand or foot differences and its effect on the surgical decision-making for their ,2019,"Background: The main purposes of this  were to assess the levels of  stress in the mothers of  with congenital hand or foot differences and to evaluate the effects of this stress on the preferred roles of mothers in surgical decision-making for their . Methods: This  included 89 mothers of  with polydactyly of the hand, polydactyly of the foot, a hypoplastic thumb, or macrodactyly. The  stress level was assessed using the  Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF). Additionally, the mothers were requested to indicate their preferred and retrospectively perceived levels of involvement in surgical decision-making for their  using the Control Preferences Scale, which is comprised of five levels ranging from fully active to fully passive. Results: The average PSI-SF scores were 73.9, and 15 mothers (17%) had a clinically significant level of stress (PSI-SF >= 90). In the mothers of  with polydactyly of the foot, the PSI score was associated with the preferred role in surgical decision-making. Conclusion: The assessment of  stress levels in the mothers of  with congenital hand or foot differences can play an important role in the screening of candidates who require psychiatric treatment or support. An evaluation of the PSI in mothers of  with congenital hand or foot differences may aid physicians to modify their  of decision-making based on the preferred role of the mother."
Mothers' Educational Behavior - A comparison between Turkish-German and German mothers of  of pre-school age,2014,"In this  the  behavior of 98 Turkish-German and 99 German mothers with preschool-aged  was assessed with the Child-Rearing Practices Questionnaire developed by Paterson and Sanson (1999). This instrument, which has been proven valid for the assesment of  behavior of s with preschool-aged  and has already been applied to Turkish immigrant mothers in Australia and in the Netherlands, consists of 30 items assigned to four subscales: warmth, inductive reasoning, obedience demandingness, and punishment. MANCOVAs, controlling for socio-demographic variables like educational background and age of the mothers and the number of , revealed no significant differences in the  practices of Turkish-German and German mothers. Both groups of mothers showed a high occurrence of warmth and inductive reasoning, a moderate extent of obedience demandingness and rarely punishing behavior. The , widely in line with the  from Australia and the Netherlands, challenge the prevailing assumptions in the public and media, partly  scientific, discourses in Germany concerning a primarily authoritarian  in Turkish-German families."
Reliability and validity of the Parenting Scale of Inconsistency,2006,"The purposes of the   were to develop a  Scale of Inconsistency and to evaluate its initial reliability and validity. The 12 items assess the inconsistency among s' moods, behaviors, and attitudes toward . In the primary , 517 participants completed three measures: the new  Scale of Inconsistency, the al Bonding Instrument, and the Depression Scale of the General Health Questionnaire. The  Scale of Inconsistency had good test-retest reliability of .85 and internal consistency of .88 (Cronbach coefficient alpha). Construct validity was good as Inconsistency scores were significantly correlated with the Care and Overprotection scores of the al Bonding Instrument and with the Depression scores. Moreover, Inconsistency scores' relation with a dimension of   distinct from Care and Overprotection suggested that the  Scale of Inconsistency had factorial validity. This scale seems a potential measure for examining the relationships between inconsistent  and the mental health of ."
Authoritative parenting and college students' academic adjustment and success,1999,"This  examined connections between college students' adjustment and success and characteristics of their relationships with their s. A sample of 236 students completed the Student Attitudes and Perceptions Survey, a 135-item anonymous self-report instrument, Students' grades, confidence level, persistence, task involvement, and rapport with their teachers were generally predicted by both current and hood levels of al autonomy granting, demandingness, and supportiveness. Ratings of  characteristics were equally predictive of adjustment and success among students living with their s and those living on their own. They were somewhat less predictive of seniors' adjustment and success than they were for freshmen, sophomores, and juniors. These findings suggest that   continues to play an important role in the academic lives of college students."
Parents' attachment internal working models and the change of parenting style: influence on 's social status and father's role,2012,"This  examined the association between s' attachment working models (IWM), the observed quality of mother- and father- relationships, and 's peer social status. Forty-four 7-9 years olds were observed and videotaped at home while interacting separately with their mothers and fathers. Interactions were coded on global measures of positive, negative, controlling, disconfirming, correcting behaviors and neutral conversation. Children's peer acceptance at school was assessed by sociometric techniques. IWM were assessed by AAI. Our  indicate strong associations between s' IWM and the quality of relationships with their . Dismissing and entangled s were keen to be less positive, more negative, controlling and disconfirming than secure ones. A high percentage of insecure s had  who were rejected at school. The influence of a secure partner on the other's   and on 's social success was  studied."
Relations of parenting and negative life events to cognitive diatheses for depression in ,2006,"In a sample of 299  (grades 2, 4, and 6), we examined  and negative life events as predictors of depressive cognitions, specifically low self-perceived competence, depressive cognitive schemas, and depressogenic attributional . We  examined developmental trends in these relations. Children completed measures of , negative life events, and depressive cognitions. s  completed measures of  and negative life events. Consistent with our hypotheses, negative  and negative life events corresponded with higher levels of depressive cognitions, whereas positive  corresponded with lower levels of depressive cognitions. The relations between negative  and negative automatic thoughts were stronger for older . Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

Problem behaviours and parenting in preschool  with cystic fibrosis,2009,"Background: Problems with sleep, eating and adherence to therapy may adversely affect health outcomes in  with cystic fibrosis (CF). Data on the prevalence of such problems, associated   and caregiver mental health are limited. Aims: To determine: (a) the prevalence of sleep, mealtime, therapy adherence and externalising and internalising behavioural problems in preschool  with CF; (b) the prevalence of caregiver mental health problems and poor sleep quality; and (c) associations between  behavioural problems and  . Methods: This was a cross sectional survey of caregivers of  aged 6 months to 5 years attending CF outpatient clinics at Royal Children's Hospital (Melbourne), Monash Medical Centre (Melbourne) and Sydney Children's Hospital. Main outcome measures were  externalising and internalising behaviours, sleep, eating and adherence with therapy; the predictor was   (harsh, inconsistent, overprotective). Results: 117 of 139 families participated. Problems were common with  sleep (small problem: 31.6%; moderate/large problem: 21.9%), eating (32.4%) and adherence with physiotherapy (50.4%). Compared to normative data, sleep and mealtime problems were more prevalent. Caregivers reported high rates of symptoms indicating depression (33.3%), anxiety (16.4%) and stress (34.2%). Harsh  was associated with internalising behaviours (adjusted OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.16 to 13.17, p= 0.03). Conclusions: Problems with sleeping, eating and physiotherapy adherence were common in preschool  with CF. Caregivers reported high rates of symptoms indicative of mental health problems. Harsh  was associated with internalising problems. An intervention targeting  problem behaviours and al mental health would be appropriate for CF families."
The parenting sense of competence scale: Evidence of a stable factor structure and validity,2000,"In this , 110 mothers and 110 fathers of 5- to 12-year-old boys and girls completed the  Sense of Competence (PSOC) scale and measures of  behaviour,  , and marital satisfaction. We replicated the factor structure of the  Sense of Competence Scale produced by Johnston and Mash (1989), and provided evidence that the Satisfaction and Efficacy scales from this measure assess distinct aspects of  self-esteem. Interestingly, s of girls reported higher Efficacy scores than s of boys. To address the validity of the PSOC scale, we calculated partial correlations between Efficacy and Satisfaction PSOC scores and other measures of family functioning, controlling for the shared variance between the two scales. Significant small-to-moderate size correlations were found between s' reports of both internalizing and externalizing  problems and Satisfaction scores, but correlations with Efficacy scores were generally small and nonsignificant, particularly for mothers. We  found that mothers and fathers who reported a more easy-going, low-conflict   were more satisfied in ; for mothers, a similar relationship was found for  efficacy. In addition, Satisfaction scores shared a small but significant amount of variance with mother-father agreements in  , as well as marital satisfaction. Implications of the findings for the use of the  Sense of Competence scale are discussed."
Parenting style in relation to pathogenic and protective factors of type A behaviour pattern,1999,"Background: Studies of type A behaviour pattern suggest that it can be promoted as a whole by certain al rearing . However, the association of the different components of the type A behaviour with specific rearing practices has not been clarified. Method: The relationship between s' rearing  and the different type A behaviour components of their  was analysed in a sample of 312 university students. al rearing  was assessed with the EMBU, a Swedish measure originally designed to assess one's recollections concerning one's s rearing behaviour. Type A pattern was measured by the JAS, a self-administered questionnaire that gives the global type A score and three of its components. Results: Hard Driving was related to Rejection and Favouring Subject in males. Speed-Impatience was related to Rejection and Control in both sexes, and Job Involvement was related to Control and Favouring Subject in females. In a discriminant factor analysis in males, Rejection, Control and Favouring Subject on the part of fathers classified correctly 80% of the subjects identified as having high or low Speed-Impatience and the variables of Rejection and Favouring Subject ( by fathers) classified correctly 69.23% of the subjects identified as high or low Hard Driving. In females, Control and Favouring Subject on the part of mothers and low Rejection by fathers classified correctly 70.37% of the subjects with high or low Job Involvement. Conclusion: These  suggest that different rearing characteristics are related to the various components of the type A behaviour pattern."
"Low- and high-achieving Australian secondary school students: Their parenting, motivations and academic achievement",2007,"The achievement goals and  of a sample of 879 grade 8-10 Australian students were examined to distinguish differences between low- and high-achieving students. Structural equation modelling was used to test a theoretical model linking al warmth and strictness/supervision via mastery goals, self-efficacy, and self-handicapping to achievement. Results validated and extended previous findings concerning achievement goal theory, self-efficacy, self-handicapping and  , supporting the role of self-efficacy in mediating the effects of al  through a mastery goal orientation to achievement. Low achievement was significantly linked to neglectful  perceptions, higher self-handicapping and lower mastery goals and self-efficacy. An authoritative   was found to predict higher achievement via enhanced mastery goals and self-efficacy while protecting against self-handicapping."
The Effects of Parenting Styles on Internalizing and Externalizing Behaviors: A Mexican Preadolescents Study,2020,"al practices such as inconsistent discipline, psychological control, and imposition have been linked to the development of internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors in preadolescents. This  aimed to identify the association these practices had on Mexican preadolescent problem behaviors through Structural Equation Modeling. The sample consisted of 306 elementary students from three public schools in Mexico City (age M = 10, SD = 0.92). Students completed subscales from the al Practice Scale, the Alabama  Questionnaire, and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Paternal imposition and maternal psychological control were significant predictors for internalizing problems, while inconsistent discipline was a significant predictor of externalizing problems. The  highlight that although al practice values might differ across cultures, their association to problem behaviors are similar."
Children Affected by War and Armed Conflict: Parental Protective Factors and Resistance to Mental Health Symptoms,2017,"This  examined the role of   and al warmth in moderating relations between exposure to political life events and mental health symptoms among 277 Israeli adolescents aged 12-14 and their s, who had been exposed to protracted periods of war, missile bombardments, and terrorism. Adolescents completed the Political Life Events (PLE) scale, Brief Symptom Inventory and questionnaires regarding   and al warmth. The primary caregiver completed the Child Behavior Checklist for assessment of the 's internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Results confirmed that severity of PLE exposure was positively correlated with psychological distress and with internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Maternal authoritativeness and warmth functioned as protective factors and had moderating effects on the relation between PLE exposure and mental health symptoms. In contrast, maternal authoritarianism exacerbated the relation between PLE exposure and 's externalizing symptoms. Fathers'   and warmth had no significant relationship with 's mental health outcomes. These findings have important clinical and practical implications for al guidance and support during periods of war and armed conflict."
"Maternal and paternal parenting practices and their influence on 's adiposity, screen-time, diet and physical activity",2014,"The primary aim of this  was to examine a range of potential behavioral and maternal/paternal correlates of adiposity in . Secondary aims were to examine (a) correlates of screen-time, diet and physical activity and (b) if there were differences in maternal and paternal physical activity- and dietary-related  practices. Cross-sectional analysis was conducted using 70 families with  (59% boys (41/70), mean age 8.4 (+/- 2.4) years).  practices were measured using the  Strategies for Eating and Activity Scale. Children's outcomes included: 7-day pedometry (physical activity), screen-time, percent energy from core foods (Food frequency questionnaire) and BMI z-score. Multiple regression models were generated to examine the associations between maternal and paternal  practices and 's variables. In the regression analyses, fathers' BMI (p < .01) and mothers' control (p < .001) were significantly associated with  weight status. Fathers' reinforcement (p < .01) was significantly associated with  physical activity. For screen-time, mothers' monitoring (p < .001) and  characteristics [age (p = .01), sex (p = .01), BMI z-score (p = .03)] were significant predictors. Mothers'  practices [limit setting (p = .01), reinforcement (p = .02)] and  screen-time (p = .02) were significantly associated with intake of core foods. Despite some similarities within families, three out of five  constructs were significantly different between mothers and fathers. Mothers and fathers have different al influences on their 's weight status and life behaviors and both should be included in life interventions targeting . A focus on maternal  specifically relating to screen-time and diet, and father's physical activity  and weight status may support their  in developing more healthy behaviors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Parenting in the face of serious illness: Childhood cancer survivors remember different rearing behavior than the general population,2019,"Objective A 's cancer diagnosis and treatment affect the whole family. While it has been recognized that s are an important resource for their , little is known about the specifics of  in the face of serious illness. Methods We used the Recalled al Rearing Behavior Questionnaire in a register-based cohort of adult hood cancer survivors (CCS) (N = 951) and a reative population sample of the same age range (N = 2042). The questionnaire assesses behavior of mothers and fathers with three scales (emotional warmth, rejection/punishment, and control/overprotection) by querying the (former) . We compared the two groups using general linear models. With a hierarchical linear regression analysis, we tested associations of recalled rearing behavior with disease- and treatment-related factors. Results Compared with the general population, CCS remembered both s as emotionally warmer, more overprotective, and less punishing/rejecting and less ambitious. The regression analysis showed that having received radiotherapy (beta = 0.092; P = .009) and chemotherapy (beta = 0.077; P = .027) was positively related to memories of maternal emotional warmth. Conclusions CCS remembered   which are generally deemed more positive. The extent of recalled control and overprotection deviated from the population in different directions, suggesting that  in hood cancer entails more complex adaptations than being affectionate and giving comfort. The  suggest an adaptation of al behavior to particularly challenging treatments. They highlight potential vulnerability and resilience factors, some of which were sex-dependent."
15-year-old tobacco and alcohol abstainers in a drier generation: Characteristics and lifestyle factors in a Norwegian cross-sectional sample,2019,"Aims: Norwegian adolescents currently drink and smoke less on average than previous cohorts. Based on cross-sectional survey data, the individual and familial characteristics of 15-year-old non-users and users of alcohol and tobacco were compared to identify correlates to abstinence. Methods: The survey was approved by the Norwegian Social Science Service. The sample consisted of 3107 adolescents from a 2011 school-based survey, of which 848 (27.3%) did not drink alcohol nor use tobacco. Associations with leisure time activities, risk perceptions,   and social factors were analysed by logistic regression. Results: Most of the non-drinkers were  non-users of tobacco. Abstainers (neither alcohol nor tobacco use) tended to have less unorganized and more hobby-related leisure time activities, higher risk perceptions for smoking, and monitoring or emotionally supportive s. They more rarely reported close relationships with their best friend and were more likely to report lower occurrences of drinking and smoking among friends or siblings."

"The relationship between personality, dysfunctional parenting in hood, and lifetime depression in a sample of employed Japanese adults",2000,"Background: Few studies have explored the relationship between personality, dysfunctional  in hood, and adult depression. Methods: Pal ental rearing  and personality scores as measured by the al Bonding Instrument (PBI) and the Interpersonal Sensitivity Measure (IPSM) were compared in a group of employed Japanese adults with and without a lifetime history of depression. The diagnosis was provided by the Inventory to Diagnose Depression, Lifetime version (IDDL). To estimate the effects of the PBI and the IPSM scores on lifetime depression, a multiple logistic regression analysis was performed. Results: Subjects with lifetime depression were seen to have significantly lower scores on the PBI 'care' and higher scores on the IPSM than the subjects without lifetime depression. Lower levels of maternal care and higher Levels of 'interpersonal sensitivity' each independently increased the risk for lifetime depression. Limitations: The findings of the   may not be conclusive since the data were retrospectively obtained. Conclusion: Dysfunctional  and personality seem to be correlated by lifetime depression, but it is uncertain whether they are independent risk factors (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Chinese translation and validation of a parental feeding style questionnaire for parents of Hong Kong preschoolers,2014,"Background: Childhood obesity is a major public health issue in many countries, including China. The importance of  relative to the healthy development of  requires the development of instruments for assessing al influence on  dietary pattern. This  aimed to confirm the internal reliability and validity of a self-report measure on al feeding , including emotional feeding, instrumental feeding, prompting or encouragement to eat, and control over eating. Methods: A 27-item al feeding  questionnaire (PFSQ) was translated into Chinese and then translated back into English to verify consistency. The questionnaire was then used to conduct a cross-sectional survey on the s of Hong Kong preschoolers. The internal reliability and validity of the questionnaire were examined by Cronbach's alpha and exploratory factor analysis, respectively. Results: 4,553 completed questionnaires were received. Cronbach's alpha of subscales ranged from 0.63 to 0.81, and the overall reliability was good (alpha = 0.75). The factor structure of this questionnaire was similar to that of the original and Turkish versions. One-factor structure was identified for emotional feeding, instrumental feeding (four items), and prompting or encouragement to eat, whereas a two-factor structure was revealed for control over eating. Conclusion: The Chinese version of the PFSQ has good reliability and validity in assessing al feeding  in Hong Kong. Researchers can use this instrument to improve their understanding on how al feeding  may affect the dietary patterns and ultimately the weight statuses of  among Chinese-speaking populations across different countries."

Four longitudinal   (authoritative, authoritarian, indulgent, uninvolved) were differentiated on the basis of levels and rates of change in the constituent  dimensions. Multigroup analyses demonstrated that these   were differentially related to changes in - and -reported measures of 's alcohol and cigarette use, antisocial behavior, and internalizing symptoms, with the authoritative  class being related to the most optimal long-term development."
Childhood experiences of parenting and cancer risk at older ages: findings from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA),2018,"ObjectivesDespite the importance of hood experiences for adult health and psychosocial factors for cancer development, , a key hood psychosocial exposure, has yet to be studied in relation to cancer risk at older ages. We examined whether hood experiences of poor-quality  are associated with an increased risk of cancer at older ages.MethodsWe used a sample of 4471 community dwellers aged 55years in 2007. Poor-quality  was defined as low levels of al care and high levels of al overprotection.ResultsOverall poorer experiences of , decreasing al care and increasing al overprotection were associated with increased risk of incident all-site and skin cancer in men, but not in women. Increasing paternal overprotection was  associated with increased risk of incident colorectal cancer in men. Overall poorer experiences of  and increasing paternal overprotection were associated with increased risk of prevalent all-site and colorectal cancer in women. Adjustment for covariates explained a small part of these associations.ConclusionsOlder adults who reported hood experiences of poorer quality  appear to have an increased risk of cancer. These findings improve our understanding of the role of psychosocial factors in cancer over the life course."
"Do Mothers' Status, Autonomy, and Parenting Style Influence Their Children's Initiation Into Smoking and Alcohol Use?",2020,"This  uses the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS) data set and Cox proportional hazards models to determine whether factors relating to mothers' status and autonomy, as well as other  and socioeconomic/sociodemographic variables, are associated with the early onset of 's risky behaviors, namely smoking and drinking alcohol. We find that the women empowerment variables, especially those that have direct bearing on the mother- relationship, have a significant effect in delaying or hastening the onset of risky behavior. Those factors that compete for the time spent in , such as the mother working, hastens their 's initiation into these risky habits. On the other hand, mothers' involvement in household decision-making delays smoking in females."
Caring dataveillance and the construction of good parenting: Estonian parents' and pre-teens' reflections on the use of tracking technologies,2021,"Digital  tools, such as -tracking technologies, play an ever-increasing role in contemporary  rearing. To explore opinions and experiences related to the use of such tracking devices, we conducted Q methodology and a semi-structured individual interview- with Estonian s (n=20) and their 8- to 13-year-old pre-teens (n=20). Our aim was to  how such caring dataveillance was rationalized within the families, and to explore the dominant  values associated with the practice. Relying upon communication privacy management theory, the issues of privacy related to such intimate surveillance were  studied. Three factors relating to the use of tracking technologies were extracted from both s (Tech-Trusting , Cautious  and Careful Authoritarian ) and pre-teens (Compliant Child, Autonomous Child, and Privacy-Sensitive Child). Tracking technologies were viewed as al aids that made it possible to ease anxieties and provide assurance to s and  alike. Although  did not associate the use of tracking technologies with intrusion on privacy, they expected to have a chance to coordinate their privacy boundaries."
Cultural influences on parental responses to 's pain,2018,"There is a scarcity of work examining the relationship between culture and pain-related caregiver behaviors. Moreover, no pediatric pain studies have examined the relationship between caregiver cultural values and pain-related caregiver behaviors nor discern if this process is mediated by caregiver   and moderated by ecosocial context. Based on cross-cultural developmental theories, this  hypothesized that ecosocial context would moderate the relationship between cultural values,  , and pain-related caregiver behaviors; and that   mediate the effect of cultural values on pain-related caregiver behaviors. A cross-cultural survey design was employed using a convenience sample of 547 caregivers of 6 to 12 year olds living in Canada (n = 183), Iceland (n = 184), and Thailand (n = 180). Multigroup structural equation modeling showed that ecosocial context did not affect which cultural model of  the caregiver adopted.   mediated the relationship between cultural values and pain-related caregiver behavior. Vertical/horizontal individualism, collectivism, and authoritative-and authoritarian-  positively predicted solicitousness. Vertical individualism and authoritarian-  positively predicted discouraging behavior, whereas other predictors did not. The findings support the sociocommunication model of 's pain by showing that cultural context does affect s' behaviors. They  corroborate with others' claims of solicitousness universality in a pediatric pain context. However, solicitousness may have different cultural meanings among individuals and may be used in conjunction with discouraging behavior. The findings from this  have implications for the theory development about culture and pediatric pain, but do not provide specific clinical recommendations."
Supportive Parenting Buffers the Effects of Low Peer Acceptance on Children's Internalizing Problem Behaviors,2019,"Background Children who are not accepted in their peer group are at risk of developing internalizing problem behaviors. It is possible, however, that supportive  can provide a buffer against the detrimental effects of low peer acceptance. Objective This  examined maternal and paternal affection and psychological control as moderators of the association between 's peer acceptance during the critical transition to primary school and level and subsequent development of internalizing problem behaviors from first to sixth grade. Method A total of 608  (264 girls, 344 boys) were rated by their teachers on their internalizing problems in grades 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6. Children's peer acceptance was measured in the first grade using a sociometric nomination procedure. At the same time point, mothers (n = 432) and fathers (n = 281) completed questionnaires measuring their levels of affection and psychological control. Results The  of latent growth curve modelling showed, first, that on average 's internalizing problems decreased over the school years. Second, peer acceptance was associated with the development of internalizing problems: the higher the peer acceptance, the bigger the decrease-and the lower the peer acceptance, the smaller the decrease-in the level of internalizing problems across time. However, high maternal affection provided a buffer against this impact of low peer acceptance. Among boys, low levels of maternal psychological control  provided a buffer against the effects of low peer acceptance. No significant  were found on the moderating role of fathers'  . Conclusion Overall, the  suggested that mothers' emotionally sensitive and supporting caregiving may protect  from the harmful long-term effects of low peer acceptance."
A Latent Profile Analysis of Latino Parenting: The Infusion of Cultural Values on Family Conflict,2015,"The purpose of the   was to (a) examine how acculturation and social support inform Latinos'  behaviors, controlling for gender and education; (b) describe   among Latino immigrants while accounting for cultural elements; and (c) test how these   are associated with family conflict. A 3 step latent profile analysis with the sample (N = 489) revealed best fit with a 4 profile model (n = 410) of : family  (n = 268, 65%), -centered  (n = 68, 17%), moderate  (n = 60, 15%), and disciplinarian  (n = 14, 3%). s' gender, acculturation, and social support significantly predicted profile membership. Disciplinarian and moderate  were associated with more family conflict. Recommendations include integrating culturally based  practices as a critical element to family interventions to minimize conflict and promote positive youth development."
Unravelling Quasi-Causal Environmental Effects via Phenotypic and Genetically Informed Multi-Rater Models: The Case of Differential Parenting and Authoritarianism,2018,"This  investigated the association between different experiences of  and individual right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) using twin family data comprising self- and informant reports. We applied a design that allowed us to examine whether the link between retrospective assessments of  and current RWA is effectively environmental or whether the association is attributable to genetic influences. We hypothesized that an authoritarian   (low responsiveness and high demandingness) provided by the s is associated with higher offspring's RWA, and that this association is similar for both twin siblings as a function of their genetic relatedness and shared familial experiencesthat is, genotype-environment correlation. A sample of 875 twins as well as 319 mothers and 268 fathers completed a questionnaire on twins' al environment and their own authoritarian attitudes. Additionally, 1322 well-informed peers assessed twins' RWA. Applying structural equation modelling, we found twins' experiences of al responsiveness and demandingness to be positively associated with self-reported and peer-reported RWA. The correlation between responsiveness and RWA was similar for both twins due to their genetic similarity, whereas twin differences in demandingness were positively associated with twin differences in RWA, indicating quasi-causal environmental effects. Implications for the interdependence between  and RWA are discussed. Copyright (c) 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology"

"The Association of Harsh Parenting, Parent-Child Communication, and Parental Alcohol Use With Male Alcohol Use Into Emerging Adulthood",2017,"Purpose: This  investigates the association between mother and father harsh , and - communication, and al alcohol use on males' alcohol use from early adolescence into emerging adulthood. Methods: Data come from the Iowa Youth and Families Project, a prospective 28-year longitudinal  of rural Midwestern youth and their families. Mother and father harsh , - communication, and alcohol use were assessed at time 1 when males were in early adolescence (13 years old, n = 215). Target male alcohol use was assessed at time 2 during late adolescence (18 and 19 years old, n = 206, 96% follow-up rate), and at time 3 in emerging adulthood (23 and 25 years old, n = 197, 92% follow-up rate). Results: Results obtained from structural equation modeling using Mplus, version 7, statistical software indicated that father harsh  in early adolescence was directly associated with alcohol use in emerging adulthood. Mother communication was negatively associated while father alcohol use was positively associated with adolescent alcohol use in late adolescence and emerging adulthood. Alcohol use in late adolescence was significantly related to alcohol use in emerging adulthood. Conclusion: This  offers unique insights into how mother- and father-son dyads differ in communication and  , as well as how these associations influence adolescent male alcohol use continuing into emerging adulthood. Multiple informants utilized in the current  provide a more complex understanding of how each  uniquely contributes to the role of their adolescent's alcohol use in late adolescence into emerging adulthood.

Dysfunctional Parenting and Psychological Symptomatology: An Examination of the Mediator Roles of Anger Representations in the Context of the Schema Therapy Model,2022,"In this , we investigated the mediator roles of anger-related schema modes in the relationship between dysfunctional  modes and psychological symptoms. We focused on specific schema modes (i.e., punitive and demanding  modes; vulnerable, angry, and enraged  modes; and the angry protector mode). The  included 297 college students (159 women), with the average age of the sample being 19.66 years (SD = 1.53, range = 18 to 29 years). All participants completed self-report questionnaires on schema modes and psychological symptoms, as well as a demographic form. We evaluated two different mediational models to understand two different dysfunctional  . The  suggest that all variables significantly correlated with each other and almost all the direct paths in the models were significant. However, the mediator analysis revealed that some of the anger-related modes had very low but significant mediator roles in the models (i.e., the angry  mode for both models and the enraged  mode for the demanding  model). The vulnerable  mode played a central and key role in the relationship between dysfunctional  and psychological symptoms. The  suggests that anger reations might be windows to understand and intervene in unmet core emotional needs."
Interaction Between Parenting and Neighborhood Quality on the Risk of Adolescent Regular Smoking,2012,"To conduct the first  to examine potential interaction between   and neighborhood quality on the risk of adolescent regular smoking. We analyzed data from a nationally reative sample of U.S. adolescents (n = 1,213 pairs of adolescents and their s) who participated in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics during 2002-2003. Regular smoking behavior and al monitoring level were reported by adolescents.   (i.e., authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and uninvolved) was defined by cross-classifying self-reported al warmth and control. Based on s' perceived neighborhood quality regarding raising , neighborhoods were identified as either higher quality or lower quality. Adolescents in lower-quality neighborhoods were more likely to be regular smokers (13.7% vs. 8.5%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.02-3.65) than those in higher-quality neighborhoods. In lower-quality neighborhoods, adolescents of authoritarian s (16.9%; AOR = 10.97, 95% CI = 3.36-35.84) were more likely and those of uninvolved s (20.3%; AOR = 3.47, 95% CI = 0.91-13.17) were marginally more likely to be regular smokers than those of authoritative s (4.3%). However, among adolescents in higher-quality neighborhoods,   was independent of the risk of regular smoking. There was marginally significant interaction between authoritarian   and neighborhood quality. al monitoring was associated with reduced risk of adolescent smoking, regardless of neighborhood quality. There was no interaction between al monitoring and neighborhood quality. Authoritative  is associated with reduced risk of adolescent regular smoking in lower-quality neighborhoods but not in higher-quality neighborhoods. Authoritative   and al monitoring may buffer adverse influences of low-quality neighborhood."
Educating Children in Safe Environments: Assessment of a program to improve parenting practices among parents with  aged 3-5 years,2021,"Introduction. Children's behavior is influenced by . This  aimed to assess the effect of the s Raising Safe Kids (ACT) program on  practices among s with  between 3 and 5 years of age. Method. The  consists of a quasi-experimental design, and it used a sample of 65 s between the ages of 21 and 43 years, of which 18 constituted the  group and 27 made up the control group. The hood Questionnaire (MPQ) and the Multifactorial Survey of Indicators (MICS) were the instruments used for the assessment before and after the program, respectively. Results. The  reveal that the post-test scores in the experimental group were higher than the pre-test scores, demonstrating the effect of the ACT program at a statistical and practical level in the  practices of monitoring, discipline, verbal punishment, communication, and physical punishment (p < 0.05). Discussion and conclusions. The ACT program was able to improve  practices for s with  aged 3-5. Thus, we suggest the implementation of the program analyzed to improve  to raise  who demonstrate appropriate behaviors when relating to others."
Exploring the link between maternal attachment-related anxiety and avoidance and mindful parenting: The mediating role of self-compassion,2016,"ObjectiveMindful  has been described as a set of al practices or skills that seek to enhance moment-to-moment awareness in the - relationship. Although it has been suggested that adopting a mindful approach in  may foster positive - relationships and promote the psychological functioning of  and s, little is known about the factors that may be associated with this al skill. In this , we aimed to examine whether attachment-related anxiety and avoidance were associated with mindful  through self-compassion. Design and methodsThe sample included 290 mothers of school-aged  and adolescents recruited in school settings, who completed self-reported measures of adult attachment (Experiences in Close Relationships - Relationships Structures), self-compassion (Self-compassion Scale), and mindful  (Interpersonal Mindfulness in  Scale). ResultsStructural equation modelling was used to test the proposed mediation model and to ascertain direct and indirect effects among  variables. Whereas attachment avoidance had a direct effect on mindful , attachment anxiety was indirectly associated with mindful  through self-compassion. Specifically, higher levels of anxiety were associated with lower self-compassion, which, in turn, was associated with lower levels of mindful . Higher levels of avoidance were directly associated with lower levels of mindful . ConclusionsThese  demonstrate that mothers' attachment dimensions play an important role in their levels of mindful , although through different pathways. Interventions aimed at promoting mindful  skills should attempt to promote s' self-compassion and consider s' levels of attachment insecurity. Practitioner points The  underline the important role of mothers' attachment on levels of mindful  and evidence different pathways through which attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance are associated with this al skill. Higher levels of attachment avoidance were directly associated with lower levels of mindful , whereas higher levels of anxiety were indirectly associated with lower levels of mindful  through lower levels of self-compassion. Mothers who are more self-compassionate are more able to adopt a mindful stance in the - relationship.  interventions aimed at promoting mindfulness skills in the  context can benefit from including self-compassionate exercises and are particularly important for insecurely attached s."
Thinking Styles and Coping when Caring for a Child with Severe Spina Bifida,2009,"This  now designed to identify the cognitive dimensions involved in coping and the psychological adjustment of s of  with myelomeningocele. The  included 118 adults who were s of  diagnosed with myelomeningocele. Comparison of means and regression analyses were performed to analyze variables and their contribution to al adjustment. Significant differences were found for four thinking ; coping based on Seeking Social Support and Positive Reappraisal was used frequently. The Internally Focused thinking  contributed the most to adjustment. The thinking  identified help to detect stable responses associated with caring for  with myelomeningocele. Such responses may be good indicators of the way s cope with their situation, allowing us to determine their adaptive efficacy and shedding light on designing interventions targeted at enhancing development of coping strategies in these kinds of situations."
Relationship Between Parenting and Proactive Versus Reactive Aggression Among Chinese Preschool Children,2014,"This  examines the relationship between  and proactive versus reactive aggression among preschool  in China. Children (1164) from 10 kindergartens in Shanghai were rated by their s and teachers using the  Behavior Inventory (PBI) and the Aggressive Behavior Teacher's Checklist. Children had higher levels of reactive than proactive aggression, and older  and boys had higher levels of both proactive and reactive aggression. Hostile/coercive   and low father education were significantly linked to aggression in . These findings suggest that   and type of aggression should be addressed when considering prevention and intervention. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

The  attitudes of the mothers were measured using the Adolescent-Adult  Inventory (AAPI, Bavolek, 1984), a 32 item assessment. 1 way ANOVA performed on each of the 4 subscale scores of the  attitudes indicated that the five cultural groups differed in their al attitudes. Post-hoc Tukey tests for ethnic group differences in the al attitude subscale scores yielded significant  for 16 of the 40 pairwise comparisons. These  suggest that some groups of ethnic mothers place stricter expectations, demands and control on their ."
"Early adolescents' perceptions of patterns of parenting, teaching, and school atmosphere: Implications for achievement",1998,"The purposes of this  were to examine the perceived congruence among middle school students' perceptions of  , teaching , and school atmosphere and to examine differences between ing clusters of students on the importance of grades, academic competence, and school achievement. participants were 230 fifth-and sixth-grade students whose perceptions of their contexts were cluster analyzed. Students who perceived congruent authoritative  and teaching  accompanied by high al involvement and a positive school atmosphere had the highest achievement outcomes. Students who perceived incongruent  between their s and teachers (neglecting  and authoritarian teaching) accompanied by low al involvement and a negative school atmosphere had the lowest achievement outcomes. No gender or socioeconomic differences were found among the clusters. The importance of ing students' achievement within multiple contexts is discussed."
Authoritative and authoritarian parenting practices and social and school performance in Chinese ,1997,"The purpose of the  was to examine the relations between authoritative and authoritarian   and social and school adjustment in Chinese . A sample of second grade , aged eight years, and their s in Beijing, People's Republic of China, participated in this . The  were group administered a peer assessment measure of social behaviour and a sociometric nomination measure. Teachers completed a rating scale on school-related social competence and problems for each . Data concerning -rearing practices were obtained from s, In addition, information on 's academic and social competence was obtained from school records. It was found that authoritarian  was associated positively with aggression and negatively with peer acceptance, sociability-competence, distinguished studentship and school academic achievement. In contrast, al authoritative  was associated positively with indices of social and school adjustment and negatively with adjustment problems. The  indicated that, inconsistent with the argument in the literature (e.g. Steinberg, Dornbusch, gr Brown, 1992), authoritative and authoritarian  practices were relevant to social and academic performance in Chinese ."
Parenting  with borderline intellectual functioning: A unique risk population,2007," was examined among families of  with borderline intelligence in comparison to families of typically developing  and  with developmental delays.  data were obtained at  age 5 via naturalistic home observation. Mothers of  with borderline intelligence exhibited less positive and less sensitive  behaviors than did other mothers and were least likely to display a  of positive engagement. Children with borderline intelligence were not observed to be more behaviorally problematic than other ; however, their mothers perceived more externalizing symptoms than did mothers of typically developing . Findings suggest the importance of mothers' explanatory models for  difficulties and highlight  with borderline intelligence as uniquely at risk for poor ."
Improving Early Head Start's Impacts on Parenting Through Attachment-Based Intervention: A Randomized Controlled Trial,2018,"This randomized controlled trial tested an enhanced model of Early Head Start (EHS) that combined home-based EHS with Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC; Dozier & Bernard, 2017), a brief, attachment-based intervention. The trial included 208 low-income mothers (87% Latina) and their 6-to 18-month-old infants. Control participants received home-based EHS plus 10 weekly books. Follow-up observations revealed positive impacts of the enhanced EHS plus ABC model on maternal sensitivity/responsiveness, intrusiveness, and positive regard (ds = 0.23-0.77). Exploratory analyses of moderated effects suggested stronger impacts for those mothers who began the  with greater intrusiveness or who described their adult attachment  as secure or anxious. Findings are discussed in terms of implications for improving effects on  of publicly funded programs designed to support early development."
Creation of the TXP parenting questionnaire and study of its psychometric properties,2019," is linked to conduct disorders (CD) and substance related disorders (SRD) in adolescents, but with differences according to cultural context. A questionnaire with two versions ( questionnaire TXP-A for adolescents and TXP-C for primary caregivers) was designed using the Delphi method to evaluate  practices related to CD and SRD in a Spanish population. It was validated in a community sample of 631 adolescents aged between 14 and 16 and their caregivers. Results suggest a 29-item TXP-A questionnaire with bifactorial structure: affection-communication and control-structure, with high internal (Cronbach's alpha=0.89) and test-retest (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.94) reliabilities. Both factors are related to SRD (r=0.273, p<0.001) and with most of the psychopathological dimensions studied. The total score and affection-communication are related to dissocial disorder (t=3.259, p=0.001) and its severity (r=-0,119; p=0.003). Inter-observer reliability between adolescents and caregivers is low, in part because the 16-item TXP-C has a different bifactorial structure: affection-communication and prosocial values. TXP-C's internal (Cronbach's alpha=0.87) and test-retest (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.94) reliabilities are high. The total score and affection-communication were related to dissocial disorder (t=2.586; p=0.010) but TXP-C did not discriminate according to SRD. In conclusion, the TXP-A questionnaire for adolescents seems to be a reliable, valid and unbiased instrument that evaluates the perception of  practices, relating higher affection-communication and control-structure to less psychopathology and alcohol and drug use. TXP-C  seems to be reliable and unbiased, but shows less evidence of validity regarding substance use and psychopathology."
Parental Style and Its Association With Substance Use in Argentinean Youth,2017,"Background: In Europe and the United States, family relationships and  behavior can influence youth substance use, but less is known about their influence in Latin American countries. Objective: To explore whether  behavior is associated with substance use among Latin American youth. Methods: A cross-sectional, school-based survey of middle-school youth (n = 3172) in three Argentinian cities queried tobacco, alcohol, and drug use using items adapted from global youth surveys.  behavior was assessed with previously validated items that tapped into demandingness and responsiveness, separately for mothers and fathers. Multilevel logistic regression models assessed associations between  behavior and substance use after adjusting for student characteristics, socioeconomic indicators, sensation seeking, and smoking amongst peers and family members. Results: Substance use prevalence was 10% for current smoking, 32% for current drinking alcohol, 17% for past 30-day binge drinking (>= 5 drinks), and 8% for previous year illicit drug use (marijuana or cocaine). Greater maternal demandingness was independently associated with lower likelihood of current smoking (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.77; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.64-0.92), current drinking (AOR = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.71-0.92), binge drinking (AOR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.66-0.99, and drug use (AOR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.61-0.83). No other  behavior were independently associated with substance use, except for paternal demandingness and binge drinking (AOR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.74-0.97). For all outcomes, no interactions were found between  behavior and student gender. Conclusions: Among Argentine adolescents, maternal demandingness was the strongest and most consistent correlate of substance use, regardless of adolescent substance use behavior or gender."
Long-Term Effects of Parenting and Adolescent Self-Competence for the Development of Optimism and Neuroticism,2019,"Optimism and neuroticism have strong public health significance; however, their developmental precursors have rarely been identified. This  examined adolescents' self-competence and their s'  practices as developmental origins of optimism and neuroticism in a moderated mediation model. Data were collected when European American adolescents (N=290, 47% girls) were 14, 18, and 23 years old. Multiple-group path analyses with the nested data revealed that 14-year psychological control and lax behavioral control of both s predicted lower levels of 18-year adolescence self-competence, which in turn predicted decreased 23-year optimism and increased neuroticism. However, the positive effects of warmth on 18-year optimism were stronger in the context of high maternal and paternal authoritativeness, and the positive effects of warmth on adolescent self-competence was attenuated by maternal authoritarianism. This  identified nuanced effects of  on adolescents' competence and personality, which point to important intervention targets to promote positive youth development."
Neighborhood Qualification of the Association Between Parenting and Problem Behavior Trajectories Among Mexican-Origin Father-Adolescent Dyads,2016,"To address the combined importance of fathers and neighborhoods for adolescent adjustment, we examined whether associations between fathers'  and adolescents' problem behaviors were qualified by neighborhood adversity. We captured both mainstream (e.g., authoritative) and alternative (e.g., no-nonsense, reduced involvement)   and examined  and neighborhood effects on changes over time in problem behaviors among a sample of Mexican-origin father-adolescent dyads (N = 462). Compared to their counterparts in low-adversity neighborhoods, adolescents in high-adversity neighborhoods experienced greater initial benefits from authoritative fathering, greater long-term benefits from no-nonsense fathering, and fewer costs associated with reduced involvement fathering. The combined influences of alternative paternal   and neighborhood adversity may set ethnic and racial minority adolescents on different developmental pathways to competence."
"Protecting High-Risk Youth in High-Risk Contexts: Neighborhoods, Parenting, and Victimization",2018,"Victimization theories suggest s can serve as guardians to protect adolescents from victimization, yet findings from studies examining the main effects of  variables on adolescent victimization are mixed. Prior  suggests that it is the combination of al warmth and monitoring that produces the best  across a range of other outcomes. The current  used data collected from a sample of serious adolescent offenders as part of the Pathways to Desistance  (N=888; 16.1% female; mean age=15.92). Using the first two waves (baseline and 6-month time points) of data, we estimated a series of negative binomial regression models to observe the main and interactive effects of al warmth and monitoring on adolescent victimization and the potential moderating influence of neighborhood disorder. The  indicate that the combination of warmth and monitoring reduces adolescent victimization, and that al warmth may be particularly important for protecting adolescents in neighborhoods with moderate-high levels of disorder."
"Assessment of Overprotective Parenting Attitudes and Emotional Status among Mothers in Pediatric Thalassemia, Hemofilia and Leukemia Patients in Bursa",2018,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of the current  was to investigate overprotective  attitudes and emotional status among thalassemia, hemophilia and leukemia patients' mothers. METHODS: Seventy-four  who were between six to sixteen years old participated in current . Fifty-two  were in the  group (thalassemia, hemophilia and leukemia patients) and twenty-two  in control group. Brief Symptom Inventory and al Attitude Research Instrument (PARI) were used to collect data. RESULTS: According to the , over protective  attitudes in the  group were significantly higher than the control group. When the  group was compared within itself, it was observed that the mothers of the hemophilia had significantly protective attitudes compared to the leukemia patients. The depression, anxiety, negative self-perception, somatization and hostility scores of the  group were significantly higher than the control group. At the same time, there is a positive relationship between over-protective  attitudes and anxiety. DISCUSSION and CONCLUSION: Overprotective  attitudes can cause some psychopathology and developmental defiency in the s' future personal life. Children diagnosed with chronic or serious illness and their family should be evaluated psychologically."
"ADHD and autistic traits, family function, parenting style, and social adjustment for Internet addiction among  and adolescents in Taiwan: A longitudinal study",2015,"This longitudinal  investigated the prevalence, predictors, and related factors for Internet addiction among elementary and junior high school students in Taiwan. A convenient sample of grades 3, 5, and 8 students (n = 1153) was recruited from six elementary and one junior high schools. They were assessed during the beginning and the end of the spring semester of 2013. Internet addiction was examined by the Chen Internet Addiction Scale (CIAS). Other factors were screened using the Chinese version of the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) for autistic trait, the al Bonding Instrument (PBI) for , the Family APGAR for family support, the Social Adjustment Inventory for Children and Adolescents for social function, and the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham, version IV scale (SNAP-IV) for ADHD symptoms. The prevalence of Internet addiction decreased from 11.4% to 10.6%. Male, low family support, poor social adjustment, and high ADHD-related symptoms were related to Internet addiction. However, there was an inverse relationship between autistic traits and Internet addiction. Further, its predictivity could be accounted by poor academic performance, male, and protective  . Internet addiction is not uncommon among youths in Taiwan. The predictors identified in this  could be the specific measures for the development of a prevention program for Internet addiction in the youth population. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Agreement between Fathers' and Mothers' Reported Stimulation and Associations with Observed Responsive Parenting in Pakistan,2019,"al stimulation and responsiveness are associated with improved early  development outcomes. However, the majority of studies have relied on maternal-reported measures of only mothers'  practices. The purpose of this  was to assess the agreement between fathers' and mothers' reports of their own and their partner's engagement in stimulation and assess the degree to which s' reported stimulation correlated with their observed responsive caregiving behaviors. Data were collected from 33 couples (33 fathers and 32 mothers) who had a  under 5 years of age in rural Pakistan. Paternal and maternal stimulation were measured based on reports of their own and their partner's practices in play and learning activities with the . Paternal and maternal responsiveness were observed in a subsample of 18 families. Moderate agreement was found between paternal and maternal reports of their own and their partner's practices. Moderate associations were  found between self-reported measures of stimulation and observed responsive caregiving for both fathers and mothers. The strengths of agreement and associations were greater among couples who had higher quality co relationships. Findings highlight the feasibility, reliability, and promise of assessing fathers'  in a low-resource setting, using similar methods as for mothers' , to triangulate measures between reported and observed  and gain a deeper understanding of fathers' and mothers' unique caregiving contributions."
"The relationship between parenting, family interaction and hood dental caries: A case-control study",2014,"The aim of this case-control  was to explore the relationship between  practices, - interaction and hood dental caries, using a sample of 5-8-year old  from the Netherlands. Cases were defined as  with four or more decayed, missing or filled teeth and controls were caries free. Cases (n = 28) and controls (n = 26) were recruited from a referral centre for paediatric dental care and a general dental practice, respectively.  practices and   interactions of the 's primary caregiver were observed using Structured Interaction Tasks and subsequently rated on seven dimensions: positive involvement, encouragement, problem-solving, discipline, monitoring, coercion and interpersonal atmosphere. All Structured Interaction Tasks were videotaped, and coded by trained and calibrated observers blind to the dental condition. Differences in  dimensions between cases and controls were analysed using multivariate analysis of variance, independent samples T-tests, chi(2)-tests and multiple logistic regression analyses. Controls had significantly higher scores on the dimensions positive involvement, encouragement, problem-solving and interpersonal atmosphere, compared to cases. s of controls were  less likely to show coercive behaviours. These associations remained statistically significant after adjustment for the mother's education level, tooth brushing frequency and the frequency of consuming sugary foods and drinks, except for coercion. There was no significant difference in discipline between cases and controls. In conclusion, this case-control  found a significant relationship between  practices,   interaction quality and hood dental caries. Our findings suggest that  practices may be an important factor to consider in caries preventive programs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Does maternal attachment to her infant mediate the link between perceptions of infant crying at 6 months and parenting stress at 24 months? A structural equation modelling approach,2019,"Background  stress is influenced by many factors including maternal attachment and excessive infant crying, yet the nature of these relationships is not well understood. For example, excessive infant crying despite maternal soothing may impact maternal attachment to the , leading to higher stress. This paper explored whether maternal perception of excessive infant crying at 6 months was associated with higher maternal  stress at 24 months, and whether maternal attachment mediated this relationship. Methods All families,  at 24 months in a randomized controlled trial of a 5-year early intervention programme targeting school readiness skills in disadvantaged area of Ireland, were included. At 6 months, infant crying was assessed using a maternal reported measure of duration of infant crying, and maternal attachment to the infant was assessed using the Condon Maternal Attachment Scale.  stress was assessed at 24 months using the rearing stress subscale from the  Stress Index. Structural equation modelling was used to explore the direct and indirect effects of maternal perceptions of excessive infant crying on  stress, controlling for infant, maternal, and environmental characteristics, and focusing on the mediating role of maternal attachment. Results Reporting excessive infant crying at 6 months was associated with lower maternal attachment at 6 months, which led to higher  stress at 24 months. In addition, vulnerable adult attachment , previous maternal mental health difficulties, low paternal education, paternal involvement with the , and not being married were associated with higher  stress. Conclusion Findings suggest that the association between maternal perceptions of excessive crying at 6 months and later  stress may be mediated through maternal attachment to the infant. Interventions based on improving maternal attachment could be investigated to determine the effectiveness of supporting mothers with low attachment."
The Effects of Positive and Negative Parenting Practices on Adolescent Mental Health Outcomes in a Multicultural Sample of Rural Youth,2015,"The quality of - relationships has a significant impact on adolescent developmental outcomes, especially mental health. Given the lack of  on rural adolescent mental health in general and rural - relationships in particular, the current longitudinal  explores how rural adolescents' (N = 2,617) perceptions of  practices effect their mental health (i.e., anxiety, depression, aggression, self-esteem, future optimism, and school satisfaction) over a 1 year period. Regression models showed that current  practices (i.e., in Year 2) were strongly associated with current adolescent mental health outcomes. Negative current , manifesting in -adolescent conflict, was related to higher adolescent anxiety, depression, and aggression and lower self-esteem, and school satisfaction. Past -adolescent conflict (i.e., in Year 1)  positively predicted adolescent aggression in the . Current positive  (i.e.,  support, - future orientation, and  education support) was significantly associated with less depression and higher self-esteem, future optimism, and school satisfaction. Past  education support was  related to current adolescent future optimism. Implications for practice and limitations were discussed."

The current  expands on existing  by examining the effects of  sexual abuse and intimate partner violence on   and  self-efficacy. In women from a  intervention program (n = 20),  sexual abuse was related to lower  self-efficacy and more permissive . In women at a domestic violence shelter (n = 45),  sexual abuse was related to current sexual coercion of the partner, and authoritative  was related to higher  self-efficacy. These  indicate that having a history of  sexual abuse should be taken into consideration when dealing with mothers in violent relationships."
Functional parenting in Pakistan,1999,"We obtained information regarding  perceptions and psychosocial adjustment from 102 Pakistani young women.  behaviours assessed pertained to warmth and dominating control, as well as to training (proposed by Chao as having relevance in other Asian cultures), and indigenously relevant items related to religion and shame/honour. Adjustment measures included self-esteem, relationship harmony, and self-perceived health, shown to have relevance in other Asian cultures. In two-factor analyses, perceptions of s' warmth and training behaviours combined into a factor that correlated positively with adjustment measures, whereas the dominating control factor correlated negatively. In three-factor analyses, perceptions of mothers' training behaviours predicted variance in relationship harmony, independent of perceptions of warmth and dominating control behaviours. These findings support Chao's views that the dimension of training may play a particularly important role in functional  in some non-Western cultures"
Parenting practices toward food and 's behavior: Eating away from home versus at home,2017,"  influences a 's overall diet quality and establishes food preferences.   and food rules for  differ by eating at home or away from home. Eating meals away from home is increasing despite associations with consumption of unhealthy foods and higher weight status. The objective of the current  was to compare  practices and decision-making at restaurants versus at home. A mixed methods approach was utilized: facilitated, individual interviews to explore decision-making and  practices; written questionnaires for socio-demographic information; and body mass index. Summaries and emergent themes were generated based on examination of tapes and transcripts. Descriptive statistics were computed for questionnaire data. Twenty-five mothers of  of five to eight years who ate at restaurants at least two times per week participated. Mothers reported more permissive food rules at restaurants yet maintained higher behavioral expectations. Mothers were  more likely to make decisions about whether they eat out, where to eat, and 's meal selections than their . The findings suggest that  practices toward overall behavior and food choices may differ at restaurants than at home, highlighting the importance of healthy menu options, further , and educational strategies.

Does the Parenting of Divorced Mothers and Fathers Affect Children's Well-Being in the Same Way?,2014,"This  is embedded within a recent theoretical shift emphasising the importance of fathers as equal co-s. Nevertheless,  examining whether fathers and mothers are equally important to the well-being of  remains underdeveloped. For this reason, we investigate first whether the impact of maternal and paternal  is equally important to the well-being of  after divorce. Second, we examine whether maternal and paternal  is equally important for 's well-being in different custodial arrangements. Using constraint-moderated structural equation models, we analyse a subsample of the 'Divorce in Flanders' dataset, which contains information on 363  and their divorced s. Results reveal that the impact of maternal and paternal  is equally important to the well-being of . This remains the same for both  in joint custody and in families with non-residential fathers. al support has a particularly strong effect in improving the well-being of . The  of divorced fathers is therefore just as important to the well-being of  as is the  of divorced mothers."
MODELS OF PARENTING - IMPLICATIONS FOR ADOLESCENT WELL-BEING WITHIN DIFFERENT TYPES OF FAMILY CONTEXTS,1995,"The paper sets out to consider models of  and - relationships in early to middle adolescence. The principal concern is to examine the implications of various approaches to  for adolescent functioning, including school integration and psychological well-being. Particular emphasis is given to locating   and their impact on young people within a wider social context, including the composition and the socio-economic circumstances of the family. The analysis is based on data drawn from a longitudinal  of adolescent socialization (the Young People's Leisure and Life project), and replicates, with a U.K. sample, studies in the U.S. by Lamborn et al. (1991) and Maccoby and Martin (1983). The  identify four distinct types of   characterized by different degrees of acceptance and control of young people's behaviour. Permissive   predominate in the sample. However, the most effective  (judged against measures of school integration and mental well-being) is an authoritative one which is characterized by raised levels of both acceptance and control. Within a minority of families there are significant problems with adolescent- relations. These - interactions are associated with low levels of acceptance and control, with school disaffection and with poor psychological outcomes for the young people involved."
The influence of parenting on Korean 's language and school readiness: different roles of mothers and fathers depending on maternal employment,2021,"This  examined the mediated role of 's language in the effects of fathers' and mothers'  on 's school readiness. The moderated roles of maternal employment and  sex were  examined. Data were drawn from the Panel Study on Korean Children (PSKC), using a total of 1730 families (male : 51%). First, in families with full-time working mothers, fathers' support  at age 4 predicted better language development at age 5, which in turn predicted better school readiness at age 6. Second, nonworking mothers' behavioural control  at age 4 predicted 's better language development at age 5, which in turn predicted better school readiness at age 6. Lastly, mothers' behavioural control  at age 4 directly predicted 's better school readiness at age 6. The  broadens our understanding of the influence of  on 's school readiness via 's language development."
Parental Beliefs about Childhood and Adolescence from a Longitudinal Perspective,2021,"Research into family context as a socializing agent points to the need to take al beliefs into account due to the role they play in both  strategies and, ultimately, in the psychosocial adjustment of  and adolescents. The   aims to explore possible relationships between al beliefs about hood and adolescence from a longitudinal and qualitative perspective. The beliefs held by s of teenagers about adolescence are compared with those they hold about hood at that same moment, and the evolution of these ideas is charted over the course of 16 years as their  grow. A total of 102 s participated in the longitudinal . They completed two types of semi-structured interviews: one of them throughout the entire  period and the other once their  became teenagers. The  reveal an association between the type of beliefs s hold about hood and their perception of adolescence, and they indicate that these ideas change over time as more adjusted and modern beliefs about  development correlate with a more positive perception of adolescence. These  are interpreted from the perspective of their influence on beliefs about  , reflecting what is reported in the recent literature regarding the most successful  for fostering 's and adolescents' psychosocial adjustment."
Personal Contextual Characteristics and Cognitions Predicting Child Abuse Potential and Disciplinary Style,2010,"According to Social Information Processing theory, s' cognitive processes influence their decisions to engage in physical maltreatment, although cognitions occur in the context of other aspects of the s' life. The   investigated whether cognitive processes ( external locus of control, inappropriate developmental expectations) predicted  abuse potential and overreactive disciplinary  beyond personal contextual factors characteristic of the  ( hostility, stress, and coping). 363 s were recruited online. Results highlight the relative importance of the contextual characteristics ( particularly stress, avoidant coping, and irritability) relative to cognitive processes in predicting abuse potential and overreactive discipline strategies, although an external locus of control  significantly contributed. Findings do not support that s' developmental expectations uniquely predict elevated abuse risk. Results indicate stressed s who utilize avoidance coping strategies are more likely to use overreactive discipline and report increased abuse potential. Findings are discussed with regard to implications for prevention/intervention efforts."
The effects of parental control and warmth on problematic internet use in adolescents: A prospective cohort study,2020,"Background and aims: Problematic internet use (PIU) is a highly prevalent condition with severe adverse effects. The literature suggests that - bonding and al behavioral control exert protective effects against PIU. However, the most relevant studies rely on simplistic measurement of , cross-sectional designs and mixed-aged samples. Our  analyzed the effect of maternal and paternal  on PIU by using a prospective design and a cohort sample of same-aged . Methods: Data from 1,019 Czech 12-year-old sixth-graders who were followed until ninth grade were used. Maternal and paternal responsiveness and strictness were reported by  using the al Acceptance-Rejection Questionnaire (PARQ) and the al Control Scale (PCS). PIU was measured by the Excessive Internet Use Scale (EIUS). Results: The self-reported PIU prevalence in nine-graders (15-year-old) was 8.1%. , reported by adolescents 18 months before PIU screening, showed significant relationships with PIU: al responsiveness was negatively and moderately associated, while maternal strictness showed a weak positive association; the authoritative   in both s decreased PIU, with a PIU probability of 3.21%, while a combination of maternal authoritarian and paternal neglectful  was associated with PIU probability as high as 20.9%. Discussion and conclusions: The self-reported prevalence of PIU in Czech adolescents was found to be high. The effects of  on PIU were similar to the effects of  on other problematic behavior among adolescents.

To the problems of differences in personality traits,1999,"The authors suggest an alternative to get a realistic account of qualitative qualitative different forms of the same trait. They express the trait specificity not only by the values of the core factor but  by the relation of this factor to other factors, eventually to personality subsystems. They comprehend the personality trait as a relatively specified subsystem, overlapping with other subsystems, and just by that acquiring the specific qualitative feature. The authors elaborated the data from the sample of 1405 adolescents ageing 15 to 17 years from different localities in Bohemia. Every person completed the Cattell's personality questionnaire (HSPQ) and the questionnaire assessing the   in the family. Different levels of complexity of personality trait were illustrated: 1. the trait has one core factor of the first order and a few supplementary factors, 2. the trait is approximately expressed by a factor of higher order, 3. the factor of higher order expresses the cluster of traits. In all mentioned cases it is possible to take into account the relation to further, supplementary factors. Some data and methodical suggestions concerning ing the differences between sexes in personality traits were obtained. The data concerning the relations of a trait and its specific differences to the   in the family as perceived by juveniles were found out, too. The analysis of a couple of personality factors (the core one and the supplementary one) in the relation to the   indicators was used to that. This procedure can  be used to the  of relation between the trait differences and any condition in personality development. The authors consider the suggested procedure and its  to be the preliminary ones. The  bring the suggestions for further  including studies of smaller samples of persons with the casuistic analysis."
"The  of preterm survivors: shyness, parenting, and parental stress",2020,"Extremely low birth weight (ELBW) survivors have higher rates of shyness, a risk factor for poorer outcomes across the life span. Due to advances in fetal and neonatal medicine, the first generation of ELBW survivors have survived to adulthood and become s. However, no studies have investigated the transmission of their stress vulnerability to their offspring. We explored this phenomenon using a population-based cohort of ELBW survivors and normal birth weight (NBW) controls. Using data from three generations, we examined whether the shyness and  stress of ELBW and NBW participants (Generation 2) mediated the relation between the   of their s (Generation 1) and shyness in their offspring (Generation 3), and the extent to which exposure to perinatal adversity (Generation 2) moderated this mediating effect. We found that among ELBW survivors,  stress (in Generation 2) mediated the relation between overprotective   in Generation 1 (grands) and  shyness in Generation 3. These findings suggest that perinatal adversity and stress may be transmitted to the next generation in humans, as reflected in their perceptions of their  as shy and socially anxious, a personality phenotype that may subsequently place their  at risk of later mental and physical health problems."
Typologies of Helicopter Parenting in American and Chinese Young-Adults' Game and Social Media Addictive Behaviors,,"Helicopter  has emerged as a prevalent phenomenon in families with adult .

The purpose of the   was to identify multidimensional constructs of helicopter  among college students and describe how latent classes of helicopter  of mothers and fathers are related to college students' game and social media addictive behaviors in the United States and China. Using a three-step latent class approach, data from 1402 mother and young-adult  (MC) and 1225 father and young-adult  (FC) pairs in the United States and 527 MC and 426 FC pairs in China were analyzed. Four helicopter  latent classes (strong, strong but weak direct intervention, weak but strong academic management, and weak) were identified among MC and FC pairs in the United States, but three latent classes (strong, strong but weak direct intervention, and weak) were identified in China. In addition, college students whose s were in the strong helicopter  class reported a higher level of game and social media addictive behaviors than those in weak and weak but strong academic management classes in the United States, but not in China. These findings indicate that helicopter  is multidimensional in nature in both American and Chinese families, but the impact of helicopter  on college students' game and social media addictive behaviors differs between the two countries."
Relationship between Marriage Immigrant Mothers' Acculturative Stress and Their Adolescent Children's Career Decidedness in South Korea: Mediating Roles of Parenting and School Adjustment,2021,"International marriages between Korean men and foreign women from other Asian countries have been increasing since the late 1990s in Korea. This  examines the mediating effects of  self-efficacy, career-specific  behaviors, and school adjustment on the relationship between immigrant mothers' acculturative stress and their adolescent 's career decidedness. Data were collected from 1181 third grade students (583 boys, 598 girls) in Korean middle schools and their foreign mothers who participated in the Multicultural Adolescents Panel Study. A structural equation modeling analysis revealed the following multiple mediation process: immigrant mothers' acculturative stress is indirectly related to their adolescent 's career decidedness through (1) the dual mediation of  self-efficacy and career-specific  behaviors; (2) the serial mediation of  self-efficacy, career-specific  behaviors, and adolescents' school adjustment; (3) the dual mediation of  self-efficacy and adolescents' school adjustment; and (4) the mediation of adolescents' school adjustment. This  provides directions for  education and career counseling to enhance immigrant mothers'  competence and support the positive career development of adolescents from multicultural families. The , therefore, helps them grow into well-adjusted adults in Korean society, which, in turn, contributes to the well-being of immigrant mothers and their adolescent ."
Parenting and adolescents' accuracy in perceiving parental values,2003,"What determines adolescents' accuracy in perceiving al values? The current  examined potential predictors including al value communication, family value agreement, and  . In the , 547 Israeli adolescents (aged 16 to 18) of diverse socioeconomic backgrounds participated with their s. Adolescents reported the values they perceive their s want them to hold. s reported their socialization values. Accuracy in perceiving s' overall value system correlated positively with s' actual and perceived value agreement and perceived al warmth and responsiveness, but negatively with perceived value conflict, indifferent , and autocratic  in all gender compositions of - dyads. Other associations varied by dyad type. Findings were similar for predicting accuracy in perceiving two specific values: tradition and hedonism. The article discusses implications for the processes that underlie accurate perception, gender differences, and other potential influences on accuracy in value perception."
WEAKENED COGNITIVE EMPATHY IN INDIVIDUALS WITH DISSOCIATION PRONENESS,2016,"Objective: Dissociation proneness is a trait-like individual difference and a cardinal feature of trauma-related disorders. Dissociative symptoms have been associated with repeated exposure to aversive interpersonal contexts. While  has shown that dissociation proneness involves alterations in basic information processing, less attention has been brought to socio-cognitive processing. Here, a deficit in empathic abilities is hypothesized. Method: Ninety Dutch university students were selected with high, medium, or low dissociation proneness. A dissociation questionnaire and a behavioral task measuring both emotional and cognitive empathy were administered, as well as questionnaires on negative affect, emotional awareness, and  . Results: High dissociation proneness was significantly associated with lower accuracy rates on cognitive empathy, and this association could partly be explained by difficulties in emotional awareness and perceived  , but not by negative affect. No association was found between dissociation and emotional empathy. Conclusions: Weakened cognitive empathy appears to be a socio-cognitive attribute of dissociation proneness. Future  should  the impact of reduced empathy in dissociation on interpersonal interactions."
Familial Environment and Overweight/Obese Adolescents' Physical Activity,2019,"(1) Background: Family environments can impact obesity risk among adolescents. Little is known about the mechanisms by which s can influence obesity-related adolescent health behaviours and specifically how  practices (e. g., rules or routines) and/or their own health behaviours relate to their adolescent's behaviours. The primary aim of the  explored, in a sample of overweight/obese adolescents, how  practices and/or al modeling of physical activity (PA) behaviours relate to adolescents' PA while examining the moderating role of   and family functioning. (2) Methods: A total of 172 -adolescent dyads completed surveys about their PA and wore an accelerometer for eight days to objectively measure PA. s completed questionnaires about their family functioning,  practices, and  (authoritative and permissive). Path analysis was used for the analyses. (3) Results: More healthful PA  practices and al modeling of PA were both associated with higher levels of adolescents' self-reported moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). For accelerometer PA, more healthful PA  practices were associated with adolescents' increased MVPA when s used a more permissive  . (4) Conclusions: This  suggests that  practices and al modeling play a role in adolescent's PA. The family's emotional/relational context  warrants consideration since   moderated these e ff ects. This  emphasizes the importance of incorporating   into current familial interventions to improve their efficacy."
"Adverse parenting and perfectionism: A test of the mediating effects of attachment anxiety, attachment avoidance, and perceived defectiveness",2019,"The developmental model of perfectionism in the Perfectionism Social Disconnection Model (PSDM) posits that perfectionism may arise from insecure attachment (i.e., attachment anxiety and avoidance) and perceived defectiveness rooted in asynchronous or adverse - relationships. To provide a test of the developmental portion of the PSDM, we examined the mediating effects of attachment anxiety and avoidance as well as perceived defectiveness on the associations between adverse  and trait and self-ational components of perfectionism among 344 undergraduate students (79.9% female, Mage = 20.29). Congruent with the PSDM, we found significant positive correlations between adverse , attachment anxiety and avoidance, perceived defectiveness, and various components of perfectionism. Adverse  had an indirect effect on trait and self-ational perfectionism via attachment insecurities and perceived defectiveness. Results  suggest that adverse  may be associated with different constellations of attachment insecurities and perceived defectiveness that underlie different components of perfectionism. Together, this  provides additional support for the developmental model of perfectionism outlined in the PSDM by linking perfectionism with adverse , attachment insecurities, and perceived defectiveness."
Dysfunctional Parenting and Intimate Partner Violence Perpetration and Victimization among College Women: the Mediating Role of Schemas,2018,"Early Maladaptive Schemas (EMS) are negative cognitions about self and relationships that develop early in life, distort our perceptions of life experiences and are sustained via confirmatory information processing (Young et al. 2003). Although empirical evidence supports the relationship between EMS and psychopathology, there is a relative paucity of  regarding the relationship between EMS and intimate partner violence (IPV). The goal of the   was to elucidate the complex relations between recollections of dysfunctional , EMS, and IPV victimization and perpetration in adulthood. A sample of 305 women college students completed measures of perceptions of al bonding, EMS, and relationship conflict behaviors. Results revealed that the EMS of subjugation and self-sacrifice accounted for 13.9% of the variance in IPV victimization; however, the EMS of subjugation was the only significant predictor of IPV victimization and mediated the relationship between recollections of dysfunctional  and IPV victimization. Additionally, although the EMS of entitlement, insufficient self-control, mistrust/abuse, abandonment, and social isolation accounted for 11.3% of the variance in IPV perpetration, only the EMS of insufficient self-control and mistrust/abuse were significant predictors of IPV perpetration and mediated the relationship between recollections of dysfunctional  and IPV perpetration. Results suggest that these cognitive schemas may be the mechanism through which dysfunctional  renders one vulnerable to violence in relationships."
Differentiating between Confrontive and Coercive Kinds of Parental Power-Assertive Disciplinary Practices,2012,"In this essay, I differentiate between coercive and confrontive kinds of power assertion to elucidate the significantly different effects on 's well-being of authoritarian and authoritative  of al authority. Although both   (in contrast to the permissive ) are equally demanding, forceful, and power-assertive, they differ from each other in the characteristic kind of power they assert on their  to obtain compliance with s' demands. The kind of power that characterizes authoritarian s is coercive (arbitrary, peremptory, domineering, and concerned with marking status distinctions), whereas the kind of power that characterizes authoritative s is confrontive (reasoned, negotiable, outcome-oriented, and concerning with regulating behaviors). I argue that the effects of power assertion are detrimental only when coercive, so that the common presumption that power-assertive disciplinary practices per se are harmful is unjustified.

"The Role of Internet Parenting for the Internet use of Children in Pre-, Primary and Secondary School",2018,"The   analyzes the relationship between mothers' and fathers' Internet  and 's Internet use across different age groups (1-15 years). Especially, we looked at the influencing factors of al mediation strategies and the interplay of mothers' and fathers' Internet . Based on data of the DJI-survey, Growing up in Germany (Aufwachsen in Deutschland: Alltagswelten, AID: A II 2015, N = 1,196), dyadic structural equation models have shown that across all age groups shared - online activities were important influencing factors of regulating the 's Internet use. Also, the self-perceived Internet education competence of mothers and fathers has been confirmed as a relevant factor influencing a more intense use of al mediation strategies for school-aged . While the amount of Internet use among young  (1-6 years) was exclusively influenced by features and strategies of mothers' Internet , the transition to elementary school not only marked changes in the frequency of 's Internet use, but  in the ICT  of mothers and fathers. For school-aged , we indeed found an influence of fathers as well as, in case of the oldest age group, a reduced use of al mediation strategies. However, s' attitudes, competences and strategies regarding Internet  still stayed important during adolescence."
Parenting as a Reaction Evoked by Children's Genotype: A Meta-Analysis of Children-as-Twins Studies,2014," has been extensively studied but mostly as a causal factor influencing  outcomes. The aim of the current article is to examine the 's side of the relationship by meta-analyzing studies which used quantitative genetic methods that provide leverage in understanding causality. A meta-analysis of 32 -as-twins studies of  revealed a heritability estimate of 23%, thus indicating that genetically influenced behaviors of the  affect and shape al behavior. The shared- and nonshared-environmental estimates, which amounted to 43% and 34%, respectively, indicate not only substantial consistency in al behavior but  differential treatment within the family. Assessment method, age, and  dimension were found to be significant moderators of these influences. Our findings stress the importance of accounting for genotype-environment correlations in -development studies and call into question previous  that interpreted correlational  in unidirectional terms with  as the sole causal factor."
Educating boys and girls in safe environments: Assessment of a program to improve parenting practices in parents with  from 3 to 5 years old,2021,"Introduction. Children's behavior is influenced by . The objective of this  was to assess the effect of the ACT s Educating in Safe Environments program on  practices in s with  from 3 to 5 years old. Method. This  used a quasi-experimental design and was conducted with a sample of 65 s between the ages of 21 and 43, of which 18 constituted the  group and 27 the control group. The instruments used for the evaluation before and after the program were the MPQ  Questionnaire and the Multifactorial Indicator Survey (MICS). Results. The  show that the posttest scores in the experimental group were higher than the pretest scores, demonstrating the effect of the ACT program at the statistical and practical levels on the  practices of monitoring, discipline, verbal punishment, communication and physical punishment (p < 0.05). Discussion and Conclusion. The ACT program was able to improve  practices in s with  from 3 to 5 years of age. Based on this, the implementation of the program that has been studied is suggested to improve  in order to form  who, when relating to others, demonstrate appropriate behaviors."
Mothers' Working Status and Infant Development: Mediational Processes,2014,"This  investigated how mothers' working status directly and indirectly influences their infants' development. The participants were 1,818 mothers with  aged 11 months to 18 months from the Panel Study on Korean Children. We categorized mothers into four groups according to their working status: consistent working, transition to working, transition to nonworking, and consistent nonworking. We found two competing mediating mechanisms through which mothers' working status influences infant development. First, mothers' consistent working and transition to working status had a positive influence on their mental health in terms of low depressive symptoms and high self-esteem, which in turn positively contributed to positive  . Second, mothers' consistent working and transition to working status had direct adverse effects on their  . Positive   contributed to infant development. We  found that mothers' transition to working directly enhanced infant development."
"Longitudinal Pathways of Family Influence on Child Self-Regulation: The Roles of Parenting, Family Expressiveness, and Maternal Sensitive Guidance in the Context of Child Maltreatment",2020,"Maltreated  are susceptible to dysregulation, but developmental mechanisms at the family level that influence this process are understudied. In the current investigation, 4 mediators (positive , positive and negative family expressiveness, and maternal sensitive guidance during reminiscing) were examined as process variables through which maltreatment relates to 2 dimensions of  emotional self-regulation (adaptive emotion regulation and lability/negativity) measured across 3 time points (baseline, 2 months, and 6 months later) using longitudinal mediation analysis with latent growth modeling. These processes were evaluated in the context of a randomized controlled trial of a brief intervention aimed at improving maternal sensitive guidance during reminiscing. Participants included 160 maltreating mothers randomized into intervention (n = 81) or control intervention (n = 79) conditions and 78 demographically matched, nonmaltreating mothers and their 3- to 6-yearold  (N = 238). In the primary analysis, maternal sensitive guidance at baseline mediated relations between early maltreatment and emotion regulation and lability/negativity at 6 months, and latent change in emotion regulation across the 3 time points. Additionally, the intervention predicted steeper positive change in emotion regulation. In the secondary analysis, there was evidence of indirect effects of the intervention on emotional self-regulation through maternal sensitive guidance, positive , and positive family expressiveness. Implications and future directions are discussed."
Parental style and suicidal ideation in psychiatric patients,2009,"Objective One of the most complex problems in clinical psychiatry concerns the prediction and prevention of suicidal behavior. An important aspect of clinical interest is suicidal ideation, which is a stable phenomenon. Many studies stated that this condition is the basis of suicidal behavior in psychiatric patients. Numerous studies have shown an association between negative al  and family conditions in hood and high risk of serious interpersonal difficulties during adolescence and maturity, indicating that these difficulties may have a central role in the development of suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. Many reports have identified in depressive symptoms, low self-esteem, and psychotic  or psychoticism the suicidal dynamics involved in both mental (ideation) and behavioral (attempted suicide and completed suicide) aspects of this problem. Research has examined the link between  and family characteristics and suicidal ideation in psychiatric patients. Moreover, assuming that suicidal ideation is a multidimensional phenomenon involving many variables, work was directed to developing a suicidal indicator (SI) that can aggregate a large number of these variables. Methods The sample consisted of 710 adult outpatients with DSM-IV diagnosis of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, personality disorders, and psychotic disorders (515 women and 195 men). All subjects were required to fill-out the MMPI test. Analyzed were the MMPI scales for depression (D), and special scales for psychoticism ( PS), and low self-esteem (Lse), which are all known pathologic traits associated with suicidal ideation. The total score of the three scales (D+ SP + Lse/3) was described as the SI. The score was subjected to binary coding, which takes the values 0 (< 139) or 1 (> 140). Two indices were  obtained from the MMPI to measure suicidal ideation: the  Threat suicide (TS) scale, and the response to the item 339. Data on personality traits of the mother and father (depression and other psychiatric disorders, relational skills, violent behavior, affectivity), and the family environment (separation, death of a , economic problems, alcoholism, family climate), were obtained, retrospectively, using a structured questionnaire. Each significant negative trait or condition reported by a subject was assigned one point (1), and the lack of an event was assigned no points (0). The hood adversity scores were then aggregated into three categories, the Maternal Marker (MM), the Paternal Marker ( MP), and the Family Marker (MF), obtained from the sum of the number of stressful hood characterizations referring to the mother, father, and family. Using this method, we aimed  to examine the joint effects ( interactive model) of negative hood conditions on suicidal ideation in adult psychiatric patients. Finally, we  aimed to determine if an increase in the marker scores was associated with an increase in the risk of suicidal ideation. Results D, PS, and Lse MMPI scales, which make up the SI, showed good internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = 0.87). The cut-off of 140 points for the SI shows a remarkable ability to recognize the presence of suicidal thoughts (sensitivity = 0.93, specificity = 0.61). The data show the relationship between the presence of negative characterizations of al personality and family conditions and the risk of suicidal ideation in psychiatric patients, particularly marked in relation to the negativity of the family (Table II). Furthermore, the increase in the number of positive markers  increases the risk of suicidal thoughts (Table III). Results indicated that the risk of suicidal ideation (OR) is different based on the characteristics of an individual's two s. In particular, the lack of maternal affection is stronger than the paternal one, and authoritarianism increases the risk unless manifested by the father, whereas depression is significant only for the maternal figure (Table I). Conclusions The SI proved able to detect the presence of suicidal thoughts, suggesting the need for more effective therapy to reduce the likelihood of such psychopathologic dynamics (mainly the serotonin and dopamine system). SI precedes suicidal ideation and is not secondary to it. It is able to detect  potential (not communicated) suicidal ideation, which is often tenuous and definitely affects the vast majority of serious psychiatric disorders (depressive, psychotic, borderline, etc.). In this regard, the SI as reliable as investigative measure with different psychopathologic symptoms. In the second scenario,  has shown a statistical link between certain stressful conditions of hood (characterizations of negative  and family) and suicidality, as reed in the SI. In fact, the  indicate that specific, objective, and identifiable dimensions are  and could assist in creating possible preventive interventions during hood in some psycho-behavioral  and family conditions."
"The roles of parenting practices, sociocognitive/emotive traits, and prosocial behaviors in low-income adolescents",2018,"The goal of the current  was to examine the links among  practices (i.e., use of social and material rewards), sociocognitive and socioemotive traits (i.e., perspective taking, prosocial moral reasoning, and empathic concern), and prosocial behaviors among adolescents in a low-income, Midwestern community. Participants were 311 adolescents (M age = 16.10 years; range = 14-19 years; 58.7% girls; 82.7% White; 13.6% Latino). The  demonstrated that social rewards were positively associated with perspective taking, empathic concern, and pro social moral reasoning, which were each associated with multiple forms of prosocial behaviors. Material rewards were negatively associated with prosocial moral reasoning and empathic concern. There were  direct links between material and social rewards and prosocial behaviors. Discussion will focus on the intervening role of social cognitions and emotions in explaining links between  practices and low-income adolescents' prosocial behaviors."
Memories of Adolescence: Can Perceptions of Social Supports be Predicted from Baumrind's Traditional Parenting Typologies?,2011,"This  examined the relationships between  and adolescent social support, retrospectively. From a more complex point-of-view, the predictive nature of various social supports was examined in relation to Baumrind's traditional  typologies. It was hypothesized that authoritarian or neglectful   would predict low perceived social support and that authoritative   would predict higher levels of perceived social support. To obtain information pertaining to adolescent development, a sample of 73 first and second year university students completed two questionnaires (al Authority Questionnaire, The Social Support Scale for College Students) that required them to think back to their adolescent years (on average five years in the past). Results revealed multiple simple and complex associations. For example, adolescents with authoritative mothers and fathers are more likely to seek social support from family and other adults and adolescents whose fathers employed an authoritarian  possess low perceived social support. Results are discussed in terms of the links between various   and specific developmental outcomes. Furthermore, the application of the current findings to family functioning is explored."
Links between white matter microstructure and cortisol reactivity to stress in early hood: Evidence for moderation by parenting,2014,"Activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (measured via cortisol reactivity) may be a biological marker of risk for depression and anxiety, possibly even early in development. However, the structural neural correlates of early cortisol reactivity are not well known, although these would potentially inform broader models of mechanisms of risk, especially if the early environment further shapes these relationships. Therefore, we examined links between white matter architecture and young girls' cortisol reactivity and whether early caregiving moderated these links. We recruited 45 6-year-old girls based on whether they had previously shown high or low cortisol reactivity to a stress task at age 3. White matter integrity was assessed by calculating fractional anisotropy (FA) of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans.   were measured via a standardized - interaction task. Significant associations were found between FA in white matter regions adjacent to the left thalamus, the right anterior cingulate cortex, and the right superior frontal gyrus (all ps < .001). Further, positive early caregiving moderated the effect of high cortisol reactivity on white matter FA (all ps <= .05), with high stress reactive girls who received greater  positive affect showing white matter structure more similar to that of low stress reactive girls. Results show associations between white matter integrity of various limbic regions of the brain and early cortisol reactivity to stress and provide preliminary support for the notion that  may moderate associations.

"Gender-based eating norms, the family environment and food intake among Costa Rican adolescents",2021,"Objective: To examine the association between family environment variables ( , family meal atmosphere), gender-based stereotypes and food intake in Latin American adolescents. Design: Structural equation modelling applied to cross-sectional data, 2017. Setting: Urban and rural sites of San Jose, Costa Rica. Participants: n 813; 13-18 years old. Results: Data suggest direct associations between gender-based stereotypes and intake of fruits and vegetables (FV) (beta = 0 center dot 20, P < 0 center dot 05), unhealthy foods (fast food (FF)) (beta = -0 center dot 24, P < 0 center dot 01) and ultra-processed foods (beta = -0 center dot 15, P < 0 center dot 05) among urban girls; intake of legumes among rural girls (beta = 0 center dot 16, P < 0 center dot 05) and intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) among rural boys (beta = 0 center dot 22, P < 0 center dot 05). Family meal atmosphere was associated with legume intake (beta = 0 center dot 19, P <center dot 05) among rural girls. Authoritative   was associated with FV intake (beta = 0 center dot 23, P < 0 center dot 05) among urban boys and FF intake (beta = 0 center dot 17, P < 0 center dot 05) among urban girls. Authoritarian   was associated with FV consumption (beta = 0 center dot 19, P < 0 center dot 05) among rural boys, and with SSB and FF consumption (beta = 0 center dot 21, P < 0 center dot 05; beta = 0 center dot 14, P < 0 center dot 05, respectively) among urban girls. Conclusions: Findings are the first to describe the complex family environment and gender-based stereotypes within the context of a Latin American country. They emphasise the need for culturally relevant measurements to characterise the sociocultural context in which -adolescent dyads socialise and influence food consumption."

Emotion regulation strategies in bipolar II disorder and borderline personality disorder: Differences and relationships with perceived parental style,2014,"Background: Bipolar II disorder (BP II) and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) share common features and can be difficult to differentiate, contributing to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. Research contrasting phenomenological features of both conditions is limited. The current  sought to identify differences in emotion regulation strategies in BP II and BPD in addition to examining relationships with perceived al . Method: Participants were recruited from a variety of outpatient and community settings. Eligible participants required a clinical diagnosis of BP II or BPD, subsequently confirmed via structured diagnostic interviews assessing DSM-IV criteria. Participants completed a series of self-reported questionnaires assessing emotion regulation strategies and perceived al . Results: The sample comprised 48 (n=24 BP II and n=24 BPD) age and gender-matched participants. Those with BPD were significantly more likely to use maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, less likely to use adaptive emotion regulation strategies, and scored significantly higher on the majority of (perceived) dysfunctional  sub-scales than participants with BP H. Dysfunctional  experiences were related to maladaptive emotion regulation strategies in participants with BP II and BPD, however differential associations were observed across groups. Limitations: Relatively small sample sizes; lack of a healthy control comparator group; lack of statistical control for differing sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, medication and psychological treatments; no assessment of state or trait anxiety; over-reation of females in both groups limiting generalisability of ; and reliance on self-report measures. Conclusions: Differences in emotion regulation strategies and perceived al  provide some support for the validity of distinguishing BP II and BPD. Development of intervention strategies targeting the differing forms of emotion regulatory pathology in these groups may be warranted. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Authoritative Parenting Behaviors and Marijuana Use Based on Age Among a National Sample of Hispanic Adolescents,2020,"Although numerous prevention efforts have been implemented, marijuana remains the most commonly used illicit substance among Hispanic adolescents nationwide. We sought to determine the influence authoritative  behaviors have on lifetime, past year, and past month marijuana use among Hispanic adolescents overall, and then based on age (i.e., 12-13, 14-15, and 16-17 years). We conducted a secondary analysis of the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (N = 3457). We performed a series of logistic regression analyses. Nearly one-fifth (19.5%) of Hispanic participants reported lifetime marijuana use, 14.5% reported past year use, and 7.5% reported past month use. Results indicated that Hispanic adolescents who are at significantly increased risk for reporting lifetime, past year, and past month marijuana use, were those who reported that their s seldom or never performed the following behaviors: (1) checked if their homework was done, (2) helped them with their homework, (3) limited the amount of TV they watched, (4) told them they did a good job, and (5) told them they were proud of them. There were no relationships between adolescents' lifetime, past year, or past month marijuana use and whether their s made their youth do chores or limited their time out on a school night. Regarding age, while  indicated that most authoritative  behaviors have a significant effect against marijuana use, the protective effect diminished with age, with the exception of the relationship between adolescents' past month marijuana use and whether their s checked to see if their homework was done. Substance use prevention programs for this population should start in early adolescence and involve and educate s on adopting authoritative  behaviors."

The relationship between perceived maternal parenting and psychological distress: Mediator role of self-compassion,2020,"Self-compassion (SC) is defined as one's ability to face any type of suffering or failures with a kind, caring and non-judgmental manner by neither ignoring nor exaggerating them. SC has been suggested as a factor that fosters psychological resilience among adolescents and young adults. Mediator role of SC in the relationship between perceived maternal  and psychological distress among adolescents was investigated. 529 (226 females, 303 males) 9th grade high school students (between the ages of 14 and 17) living in Istanbul, Turkey were administered Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), My Memories of Upbringing (S-EMBU-C), Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) in counterbalanced order. Correlation, regression, and mediation analyses revealed that among the  variables, only perceived maternal warmth was associated with SC. Besides, SC appeared to have a significant mediating role in the relationship of perceived maternal warmth with different manifestations of psychological distress during adolescence. The findings highlighted the crucial role of perceived maternal support for adolescents to develop SC which minimizes the likelihood of having psychological distress."
"Parenting and hood anxiety: theory, empirical findings, and future directions",2003,"Theories of anxiety development suggest that al acceptance, control, and modeling of anxious behaviors are associated with 's manifestations of anxiety. This paper reviews  published in the past decade on the relation between  and hood anxiety. Observed al control during - interactions was consistently linked with shyness and  anxiety disorders across studies. Mixed support for the role of al acceptance and modeling of anxious behaviors was found in observational studies. However, there was little evidence supporting the contention that self-reported   was related to 's trait anxiety. Because of limitations associated with past , inferences about the direction of effects linking  and  anxiety cannot be made. A conceptual framework based on recent models of anxiety development (e.g., Vasey &, Dadds, 2001) is ed to aid in the interpretation of extant  findings and to provide suggestions for future  and theory development. Improved methodological designs are proposed, including the use of repeated-measure and experimental designs for examining the direction of effects."
Parents' Psychopathology Promotes the Adoption of Ineffective Pornography-Related Parenting Mediation Strategies,2021,"Approximately half of all adolescents aged 9-16 are exposed to pornography. Research has indicated that s often try to employ various mediating strategies (negative active, restriction and co-use) in order to regulate their 's exposure to undesired content, and that most of these strategies are ineffective or have the opposite effect. In the  , we investigated whether al psychopathology (depression, anxiety, stress) promotes the adoption of less optimal   and an ineffective mediating strategy to regulate their  pornography exposure. The sample comprised 1,070 Jewish-Israeli s to 10-14-year-old adolescents. Results indicated that for s who characterized with mild anxiety and/or stress tend to adopte more authoritarian and less authoritative  , which were linked with more ineffective mediating strategies with their  regarding pornography exposure - restrictive and negative active. These findings provide an opportunity for therapists as well as s to gain a better insight into the link between psychopathology,   and the ability to regulate pornography exposure among ."
Associations of Children's Appetitive Traits with Weight and Dietary Behaviours in the Context of General Parenting,2012,"Background: Individual variations in  weight can be explained by genetic and behavioural susceptibility to obesity. Behavioural susceptibility can be expressed in appetite-related traits, e.g. food responsiveness. Research into such behavioural factors is important, as it can provide starting points for (preventive) interventions. Objectives: To examine associations of 's appetitive traits with weight and with fruit, snack and sugar-sweetened beverage intake, and to examine whether   interacts with appetite in determining  weight/intake. Methods: Data were used from 1275  participating in the INPACT  in 2009-2010, with a mean age of 9 years in 2009. Their height and weight were measured to calculate body mass index (BMI). s completed a questionnaire to measure 's appetitive traits, 's dietary intake and  . Child BMI z-scores, fruit, snack and sugar-sweetened beverage intake were regressed on appetitive traits. Moderation by   was tested by adding interaction terms to the regression analyses. Results: Food-approaching appetitive traits were positively, and food-avoidant appetitive traits were negatively related to  BMI z-scores and to  fruit intake. There were no or less consistent associations for snack and sugar-sweetened beverage intake. Authoritative  voided the negative association between food fussiness and fruit intake, while neglecting  strengthened the positive association between food-approaching appetitive traits and weight. Conclusions: Early assessment of appetitive traits could be used to identify  at risk for overweight. As   can moderate the associations between appetitive traits and weight/intake in a favourable way, s are a promising target group for preventive interventions aimed at influencing the effect of appetitive traits on .

An exploration of links between early parenting experiences and personality disorder type and disordered personality functioning,1999,"Reports of early  were assessed using two measures, the al Bonding Index (PBI) and the Measure of  Style (MOPS), in a sample of 265 patients with DSM-defined major depressive disorder, Psychiatrists then rated the extent to which sample members evidenced the personality  underpinning 15 separate personality disorders, returning personality vignette scores. The extent of disordered functioning was  assessed across parameters and domains by psychiatrists, referrers, and family members, using a range of measures. Those with higher scores on vignettes measuring borderline, anxious, depressive, and self-defeating personality  rated s as uncaring, overcontrolling, and abusive. When vignettes were consolidated into scores akin to the DSM clusters, the most consistent links between perceived dysfunctional  were with the Cluster C (anxious), and Cluster B (dramatic)  and were nonsignificant for Cluster A (eccentric) , Meeting criteria for an increasing number of personality disorder clusters was associated with increasing levels of adverse . Multiple regression analyses indicated that disordered functioning (as assessed by the three independent rater groups) was most distinctly associated with paternal indifference and maternal overcontrol."
HOMOSEXUAL PARENTING STUDIES: MYTHS AND FALLACIES,2006,"When it comes to legislating on  adoption, it is necessary to take into account the published scientific evidence about the best options for these . It is therefore essential to correctly interpret the scientific studies by examining methodological aspects that could have a negative effect on validity and by applying the criteria of evidence based medicine. After analysing two exhaustive reviews, that included studies published until 2004, and additional studies published during 2004 and 2005, we conclude that the best option for  is still the household of a stable married heterosexual couple. There are to date no studies that are methodologically sound enough to confirm that adoptions from same-sex couples are not a disadvantage, or are at least indifferent, for the adoptive . However, there are quite well designed studies that suggest that  brought up by same-sex couples develop worse social and health outcomes. Scientific evidence  sheds doubt on the suitability of same-sex couples for adopting  because of some factors such as mental health problems, less stability and riskier life-. It does not seem sensible to change the  adoption laws without taking account all these scientific evidences."
A Multimethod Assessment of Associations between Parental Attachment Style and School-aged Children's Emotion,2019,"Self-reported romantic attachment  is a well-studied phenomenon within the romantic relationship literature, yet surprisingly little work examines its link with - or -related outcomes. Understanding the associations (or lack thereof) between adults' self-reported attachment anxiety and avoidance with relevant outcomes in  is crucial in revealing the extent to which romantic attachment  has empirical ties with the canonical work of Bowlby and Ainsworth. With the current , we explored whether s' self-reported romantic attachment  predicts a key outcome of attachment security's emotion reactivity and regulation. Within an ethnically diverse sample of school-aged , we tested associations between s' self-reported attachment  and 's emotion reactivity and regulation, measured with subjective, behavioral, and physiological metrics at two time points. Results show that higher al attachment anxiety, and to a lesser extent avoidance, predict multiple indices (behavioral, physiological, and subjective) of emotion reactivity and regulation in . Children of s reporting higher attachment anxiety self-reported greater positive and negative emotion, as well as greater use of emotion regulation strategies. These   demonstrated lower physiological emotion regulation at follow-up. Children of s higher in avoidance reported less negative emotion after a hypothetical stressor and less use of emotion regulation strategies, but more negative emotion following a failure task at follow-up. Findings add to the body of evidence suggesting that self-reported attachment anxiety and avoidance are associated with theoretically-relevant  variables in attachment ."
Authoritative Parenting and the Transmission of Religion in the Netherlands: A Panel Study,2012,"This  was designed to explore the effect of authoritative , over and above the effect of explicitly religious  practices, on the juvenile and adult church attendance of offspring. Data were collected as part of a panel  in which 474 Dutch respondents were questioned in 1983 as youths and in 2007 as adults. In 2007 the respondents retrospectively answered questions about how they were raised by their s. Analyses revealed that juvenile church attendance depends mainly on al and more specifically on maternal church attendance, whereas adult church attendance is largely an outcome of juvenile church attendance. No effects of an authoritative  , that is, a simultaneous effect of responsiveness, strict control, and the granting of psychological autonomy as the three dimensions of authoritative  distinguished in this , were observed. Only the dimension of strict control turned out to be a negative determinant of adult church attendance."
The role of affect-communication and rule setting in perceived family support and school adjustment,2020,"Previous  suggests that al socialization  affect the implementation of family support strategies and are related to school adjustment. Nevertheless, the precise nature of the influence of socialization practices on these variables during adolescence has yet to be determined. The aim of this  was therefore to examine (separately) the direct influence of maternal and paternal affect-communication and rule setting on adolescent participants' perceived family support, and to analyze the relationship between these dimensions and school adjustment. The sample comprised 1190 secondary school and Spanish Baccalaureate students (47.1% boys and 52.3% girls; Mage = 14.76 years, SD = 1.55) from the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country. The Affect Scale (EA-H) and the Rules and Demands Scale (ENE-H) were used to assess al socialization practices, and the subscale for perceived family support from the Social Support from Family and Friends (AFA-R) measure and the School Engagement Measure (SEM) were used to assess school engagement, with the mean grades earned by participants being taken as a measure of academic performance. The  obtained reveal that paternal affect-communication contributes more than maternal affect-communication to adolescents' perception of having family support, whereas in relation to rules, only maternal rule setting was found to have an effect on perceived family support, with this effect being negative. Both components of   were found to be linked to school engagement. In the final sections, the data are discussed and the 's limitations ed."
Loneliness and depression in middle and late hood: The relationship to attachment and parental styles,2006,"In this , the author analyzed the relationship between (a)  and attachment and (b) self-competence, loneliness, and depression in  aged 8-12 years. The author administered (a) the Argentine Scale of Perception of the Relationships with s (M. C. Richaud de Minzi, 2004), (b) the Kerns' Security Scale (K. A. Kerns, L. Klepac, & A. K. Cole, 1996; M. C. Richaud de Minzi, C. Sacchi, & J. E. Moreno, 2001, Argentine adaptation), (c) the Self-Perception Profile for Children (S. Harter, 1985; M. C. Richaud de Minzi et al.), (d) the Dimensions of Depression Profile for Children and Adolescents (S. Harter & M. Nowakowski, 1987), and (e) the Louvain Loneliness Scale for Children and Adolescents (A. Marcoen, L. Goossens, & P. Caes, 1987; M. C. Richaud de Minzi et al.) to 1,019  (8-12 years of age, 483 boys, 536 girls). Results indicated that attachment and - relationship  were differentiated constructs. s' acceptance promoted secure attachment and positive outcomes in . Moreover, fathers' lack of interest had a marked negative effect. The author found differences in the perceptions and influences of fathers and mothers, which follow the cultural patterns of gender attribution."
THINKING ABOUT PARENTING - REASONING ABOUT DEVELOPMENTAL ISSUES ACROSS THE LIFE-SPAN,1993,"This  examined reasoning about developmental problems over the life span and related it to cognitive  and  behaviors. In Study 1, we investigated 35 's and adults' concepts of development (COD) stages (A. Sameroff & L.. Feil. 1985). As hypothesized. stage scores were positively related to age and to 2 other developmental indexes. In Stud\ 2, we observed 24 s and their 5th-grade . COD stage scores were positively related to more effective tutoring  by s. In Study 3. 60 adults in 3 different age groups were interviewed about standard and personal  dilemmas. COD stage scores were lower for the oldest adults on the hypothetical dilemma only and were inversely correlated with a measure of right-wing authoritarianism."
"The Relationship Between Perceived Parenting, Negative Core Beliefs, and Dysfunctional Attitudes Among Young Adults",2017,"Previous studies have found that perceived  is associated with dysfunctional attitudes that predict depression. However, few studies have empirically investigated processes by which perceived  is associated with dysfunctional attitudes. To fill this gap, this  tested the hypothesis that perceived low al care would be associated with negative core beliefs, which, in turn, would be associated with dysfunctional attitudes. To strictly test the hypothesis, this  controlled for current depressive symptoms that could affect the relationships between  variables. The participants were 305 college students (141 females). The  differed by sex: for female students, the hypothesis was supported; for male students, negative core beliefs were associated with dysfunctional attitudes; however, perceived low care was not associated with negative core beliefs. The findings suggest that targeting low al care and negative core beliefs for females and negative core beliefs for males may help prevent their dysfunctional attitudes and the ant depression."
"Generativity and authoritarianism: Implications for personality, political involvement, and parenting",1997,"Generativity (Erikson, 1950) and authoritarianism have recently received increased attention in the personality and social psychology literature. The authors articulate connections and distinctions to test hypotheses concerning personality, politics, and  on a sample of adults and their adolescent . The Big 5 Openness to Experience factor was positively related to generativity and negatively related to authoritarianism. In addition, high scorers on generativity were interested in political issues, whereas those scoring high on authoritarianism were not. High scorers on authoritarianism  used a punitive   that had adverse consequences for - relationships, whereas generative s used an authoritative  that produced positive outcomes. Although generative and authoritarian individuals may share a focus on passing down traditions, the content of those traditions seems to span a wider range for people who are high in generativity."
"Variations in parenting and adolescent outcomes among African American and Latino families living in low-income, urban areas",2007,"Drawing from social disorganization theory, this  examined how perceived neighborhood conditions modified associations between  and delinquency, depressive symptoms, and school problem behavior among more than 800 African American and Latino 10- to 14-year-olds participating in Welfare, Children, and Families: A Three-City Study. Permissive and disengaged , maternal involvement, and punitive  were associated with youth outcomes in varying ways depending on perceived neighborhood context and a youth's race, ethnicity, and gender. Neighborhood-modifying influences on  were stronger for African Americans as compared to Latinos and for males as compared to females. Findings suggest that the stakes of uninvolved and permissive  for problematic youth outcomes are greater in higher risk neighborhoods. In addition, among African American males, punitive  is less strongly associated with poor youth outcomes when mothers perceive that the neighborhood poses more threats and offers fewer social resources."
Parenting Practices among Biological Mothers of Drug-Involved Truant Youths: A Latent Profile Analysis,2015,"Research has confirmed the continuing influence of s in the lives of  through adulthood. Although peer influence on youth attitudes, values, and behavior increases as they enter adolescence,  influence remains a significant aspect of their lives. Relatively little is known about  practices, which are critical elements in the development of  , especially among s of drug-involved truant youths (DITY). Latent profile analysis of Alabama  Questionnaire (APQ) data on  practices among 190 biological mothers of DITY involved in an ongoing, prospective intervention  identified three distinct  practice profiles: (a) low involvement and low positive , (b) high involvement and positive , and a low use of corporal punishment, and (c) the use of corporal punishment. Forty percent of mothers in this National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)-funded  report  practices that increase the risk of poor youth developmental outcomes. Analyses of collateral data supported the usefulness of the indicated profiles. The important implications of these findings for intervention services are discussed."
Positive Parenting in Adolescence and Its Relation to Low Point Narration and Identity Status in Emerging Adulthood: A Longitudinal Analysis,2009,"In this longitudinal , we examined identity development using the life story model (McAdams, 2001), in addition to a traditional identity status approach, in order to explore the association between perceived  in adolescence and the subsequent quality of life story narration in emerging adulthood. Participants (N = 100) were given a battery of questionnaires at ages 17 and 26 years and were asked to narrate a story at age 26 about their most difficult life experience. Low point narratives were analyzed for evidence of concluding clarity, resolution, and affective tone, termed coherent positive resolution (Pals, 2006). Structural equation modeling showed that participants who experienced more positive  at age 17 narrated their low points with clearer evidence of coherent positive resolution at age 26. Coherent positive resolution of the low point was  related to concurrent measures of identity achievement and emotional adjustment at age 26. Discussion centers on the potential impact of positive  as a contributor to healthy low point narration and identity in emerging adulthood."
The Effect of Parenting Stress on Child Behavior Problems in High-Risk Children with Prenatal Drug Exposure,2009,"Objective To examine the relationship between early  stress and later  behavior in a high-risk sample and measure the effect of drug exposure on the relationship between  stress and  behavior. Methods A subset of -caregiver dyads (n = 607) were selected from the Maternal Life Study (MLS), which is a large sample of  (n = 1,388) with prenatal cocaine exposure and a comparison sample unexposed to cocaine. Of the 607 dyads, 221 were prenatally exposed to cocaine and 386 were unexposed to cocaine. Selection was based on the presence of a stable caregiver at 4 and 36 months with no evidence of change in caregiver between those time points. Results  stress at 4 months significantly predicted  externalizing behavior at 36 months. These relations were unaffected by cocaine exposure suggesting the relationship between  stress and behavioral outcome exists for high-risk  regardless of drug exposure history. Conclusions These  extend the findings of the relationship between  stress and  behavior to a sample of high-risk  with prenatal drug exposure. Implications for outcome and treatment are discussed."
Moderating effects of socio-ecological factors on the relationship between adolescent exposure to media violence and attitudes towards school bullying,2020,"Aims To examine the moderating effects of individual, family, and social factors on the relationship between adolescent exposure to media violence and attitudes towards school bullying. Design A cross-sectional . Methods A total of 473 middle and high school students participated in a self-reported survey between August and October 2016. Self-reported questionnaires were used to measure perceived aggression, resilience, al violence experience,  , satisfaction with school life, teacher attitudes towards school bullying, media violence exposure, and adolescent attitudes towards school bullying. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and hierarchical multiple regression. Results Resilience (an individual factor;beta = -0.48,p = .049) and   (a family factor;beta = -0.77,p = .045) moderated the negative influence of media violence exposure on adolescent attitudes towards school bullying. The findings indicated that higher individual resilience and s with more positive   could reduce the harmful effects of media violence exposure on adolescent attitudes towards school bullying. The teachers' attitudes towards school bullying (a school factor) contributed to predicting the adolescents' attitudes towards school bullying. However, no moderating effect of school factors was found. Conclusion Resilience and   are important socio-ecological factors influencing the relationship between adolescent exposure to media violence and attitudes towards school bullying. Impact Three types of intervention programmes can be suggested based on the  of this . Reinforcing individual resilience and positive   should be considered important in developing intervention programmes targeted at eliminating the adverse effects of media violence exposure. Intervention programmes to develop   to increase the resilience of adolescents can  be considered. Lastly, programmes to screen for adverse outcomes of media violence exposure, low resilience, and poor   need to be developed."
Children's dental fear and anxiety: exploring family related factors,2018,"Background: Dental fear and anxiety (DFA) is a major issue affecting 's oral health and clinical management. This  investigates the association between 's DFA and family related factors, including s' DFA,  , family structure (nuclear or single- family), and presence of siblings. Methods: A total of 405  (9-13 years old) and their s were recruited from 3 elementary schools in Hong Kong. Child's demographic and family-related information was collected through a questionnaire. s' and 's DFA were measured by using the Corah Dental Anxiety Scale (CDAS) and Children Fear Survey Schedule-Dental Subscale (CFSS-DS), respectively.   were gauged by using the  Authority Questionnaire (PAQ). Results: DFA was reported by 33.1% of . The mean (SD) CFSS-DS score was 29.1 (11.0). Children with siblings tended to report DFA (37.0% vs. 24.1%; p = 0.034) and had a higher CFSS-DS score (29.9 vs. 27.4; p = 0.025) as compared with their counterpart. Children from single- families had lower CFSS-DS score as compared with  from nuclear families (beta = - 9.177; p = 0.029). Subgroup analysis showed a higher CFSS-DS score among boys with siblings (beta = 7.130; p = 0.010) as compared with their counterpart; girls' from single- families had a lower CFSS-DS score (beta = - 13.933; p = 0.015) as compared with girls from nuclear families. Children's DFA was not associated with s' DFA or   (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Family structure (nuclear or single- family) and presence of siblings are significant determinants for 's DFA. al DFA and   do not affect 's DFA significantly."
ASSESSING PARENTING AND FAMILY FUNCTIONING MEASURES FOR URBAN AMERICAN INDIANS,2017,"Urban American Indian (AI) families often live in two worlds, and widely used  measures may not adequately capture their  . Drawing from baseline surveys of AI s living in 3 urban communities in Arizona (n = 606), this  examines the applicability of using 6 previously validated measures with urban AI s:  self-agency, al supervision, positive  practices, discipline, family cohesion, and -adolescent conflict. A 4-step factor analytic sequential procedure was employed, and  indicate the only measure remaining as a single factor is discipline. The 2 difference tests of the remaining 5 measures indicate multiple factors fit the data significantly better than the previously validated single factor. These findings indicate previously validated measures are not adequate holistic descriptions of the  and familial experiences of urban AIs. Understanding how urban AIs conceptualize  provides a foundation for strengthening urban AI families. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
"The association between perceived parenting and adulthood anxiety: The mediator roles of emotion regulation, shame and anger",,"Although the role of  on offspring's anxiety has burgeoned attention in the literature, a limited number of es have taken into consideration maternal and paternal influence separately. Besides, the need for knowledge about the mechanisms involved in the continuity of this relationship remains. Therefore, the   aimed to explore the relationship between perceived  practices and trait anxiety during adulthood through difficulty in emotion regulation (ER), shame, and anger. The  was carried out with a community sample comprised of 544 adults (408 females and 136 males) aged between 18 and 50 (M = 26.52, SD = 7.30). Data was collected through the online administration of self-report measures including Short EMBU-Own Memories of Upbringing, Test of Self-Conscious Affect-3, Trait Anger Scale, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait Form. The  of the hierarchical regression analysis revealed that only paternal rejection and maternal overprotection were the predictors of adult anxiety. In addition, difficulty in ER, shame, and anger all had significant mediator roles in these associations. Current findings highlight the different maternal and paternal  that might play a role in the origin of offspring's anxiety and provide an emotional model that might explain the endurance of this impact during adulthood."
The influence of culture on parental styles in social vulnerability contexts,2013,"The objectives of this  are: (a) to analyze if the relationship between  dimensions and  adjustment regarding coping strategies are similar in Argentinian and Spanish samples within poverty contexts; (b) to compare al dimensions in the two groups studied, and (c) to determine the efficiency of  through the  of their influence in  coping strategies. The Graffar-Mendez Castellano Scale (Mendez- Castellano & Mendez, 1994), that brings a socioeconomic description of the population; an Argentinian Scale of Children Perception of al Relationships for 8 to 12 years of age (Richaud, 2007a), and the Argentine Questionnaire of Coping for  (Richaud, 2006) were administered to a sample of 458 Spanish and Argentinian  from 8 to 12 years old. Correlations were carried out to analyze the relationships between  dimensions and  coping strategies in both groups, and MANOVA, to  if there were different al dimensions in the two groups -Argentina and Spain-, and to analyze if there were differences in  coping strategies. The  indicate that correlational pattern is similar in both groups, but al dimensions are different for each culture, being the Argentinian s more neglectful than Spanish s. At the same time, Argentinian  adopt coping strategies less efficient that the Spanish  ones, involving in that way a greater emotional conflict."
"Creativity Outside School: The Influence of Family Background, Perceived Parenting, and After-school Activity on Creativity",,"The   involved two studies that investigated the creativity development of Chinese  and young adolescents (9-14 years old). It was hypothesized that family socio-economic status (SES), perceived  (e.g., al autonomy support, involvement, and overcontrol), and after-school activities contribute to the development of creativity. Study 1 showed that self-rated creativity (mini-c) was positively associated with 's perceived  and SES, whereas expert-rated creativity (little-c) and teachers' rated creativity was positively associated with academic achievement. Study 2 replicated and expanded Study 1 by involving a larger sample and adding factors from the s' perspective and new measurements of creativity. Study 2 found that 's perceived  and SES were the most significant contributors to the mini-c, followed by age. In terms of little-c, the most significant contributor was 's age, followed by 's perceived  and SES. Moreover, participation in after-school activities played a critical role in the development of creativity, as reed by both little-c and mini-c. The implications of this  are discussed."
New directions in analyses of parenting contributions to 's acquisition of values,2000,"Traditional theories of how  acquire values or standards of behavior have emphasized the importance of specific  techniques or  and have acknowledged the importance of a responsive - relationship, but they have failed to differentiate among forms of responsiveness, have stressed internalization of values as thf desired outcome, and have limited their scope to a small set of  strategies or methods.

Development and preliminary validation of the Parenting around SNAcking Questionnaire (P-SNAQ),2018,"Snacking makes significant contributions to 's dietary intake but is poorly understood from a  perspective. This  was designed to develop and evaluate the psychometrics of a theoretically grounded, empirically-informed measure of snack . The  around SNAcking Questionnaire (P-SNAQ) was developed using a conceptual model derived from current theory and mixed-methods  to include 20 hypothesized snack  practices along 4  dimensions (autonomy support, structure, coercive control and permissiveness). Expert panel evaluation and cognitive interviews were used to refine items and construct definitions. The initial instrument of 105 items was administered to an ethnically diverse, low-income sample of 305 s (92% mothers) of  aged 1-6 y participating in three existing cohort studies. The sample was randomly split into two equal samples. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted with the first sample to identify snack  practices within each  dimension, followed by confirmatory factor analysis with the second sample to test the hypothesized factor structure. Internal consistency of sub-scales and associations with existing measures of food  practices and  and  weight status were evaluated. The final P-SNAQ scale included 51 items reflecting 14 snack  practices across four  dimensions. The factor structure of the P-SNAQ was consistent with prior theoretical frameworks. Internal consistency coefficients were good to very good for 12 out of 14 scales and subscale scores were moderately correlated with previously validated measures. In conclusion, initial evidence suggests that P-SNAQ is a psychometrically sound measure for evaluating a wide range of snack  practices in young . (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Parenting at home and bullying at school,2013,"The   aimed at examining the relationship that may exist between specific al practices at home and the 's bullying and victimization experiences at school. This  attempted to go beyond al , a variable that most of the earlier studies have used and introduce three, relatively new parameters of bullying and victimization; namely, - conflict, al monitoring and  disclosure. It was found that  at home seems to be related to bullying at school. However, not all aspects of  are related, and not in the same way. - conflict was found to be positively correlated to, and a potent predictor of both bullying and victimization;  disclosure was found to be negatively correlated to and  a potent predictor of bullying (not victimization), while al monitoring, unlike earlier reports, was found to be statistically unrelated to either bullying or victimization."
Parental feeding styles and adolescents' healthy eating habits. Structure and correlates of a Costa Rican questionnaire,2010,"This  designed and validated a questionnaire aimed at examining al feeding  to encourage healthy eating habits among Costa Rican adolescents. Adolescents (n = 133; mean age 15.4 years). and their s, participated in the . The s completed a al feeding  questionnaire, and the adolescents completed 3-day food records Confirmatory factor analyses suggest four distinct al feeding , (a) verbal encouragement of healthy eating behaviors, (b) use of verbal sanctions to indirectly control the intake of healthy food; (c) direct control of access to and intake of food, and (d) use of food to regulate emotions and behavior There were no correlations between dietary intake and the verbal encouragement of healthy eating behaviors, but there were significant negative correlations between (1) the use of verbal sanctions to indirectly control the intake of healthy food, and the consumption of fruit and vegetable, of calcium, iron, vitamin B6 and folic acid intake, and (2) between the direct control of access to and intake of food and fast food consumption and total carbohydrates intake The use of food to regulate emotions and behavior was positively correlated with high energy-dense food consumption Stratification of the data shows significant differences by gender in the correlations between al feeding  and dietary intake.

"Extracurricular activities, Positive Parenting and Personal Positive Youth Development. Differential relations amongst age and academic pathways",2020,"Introduction. Positive  and Extracurricular Activities are contextual assets for enhancing Personal Positive Youth Development. However, these assets have not been studied simultaneously or in students of different ages. This paper analyzed these associations, by testing a mediator model in students with different academic trajectories. Method. The sample was composed by 1.402 adolescents, aged between 12 and 20 years (Mean=14.40; SD=1.910; males=49%). Students completed various questionnaires regarding the personal constructs of Optimism, Hope, General Self-efficacy and Sense of Coherence, as well as questionnaires that address perceptions of al Style and Extracurricular Activities. A random sampling was carried out by schools in Aragon (Spain) that offered the degrees carried out by adolescents. Results. Structural equation modeling showed that Positive  was associated with the accomplishment of Extracurricular Activities and personality constructs. Further, participation in activities was associated with the same pattern of personality traits (Expectancies, Self, and Sense of Coherence). These  were found mainly in younger students (12-15 years old), while in older students (16-20 years old) this effect was found only for those with a profile of less successful academic pathways. Discussion and Conclusion. Relationships with family are the essential asset for adolescents, especially to promote Personal Positive Youth Development, but  for the engagement in Extracurricular Activities. Implications for developmental psychologists, practitioners and educators are discussed, especially underscoring the importance of offering extracurricular opportunities."
Beliefs about the Role of Parenting in Feeding and Childhood Obesity among Mothers of Lower Socioeconomic Status,2012,"Objective: To examine beliefs about the role of  in feeding and hood obesity among mothers of lower socioeconomic status. Methods: Individual semistructured, audiotaped interview with 91 mothers of preschool-aged  (49% of mothers obese, 21% of  obese) in the midwestern United States. Participant comments were transcribed and common themes were identified using the constant comparative method and NVivo software. Results: Mothers often described their s' feeding  as authoritarian or neglectful, and their own current  as comparatively indulgent and better. Mothers described s of overweight  as inept or neglectful, but they never described their own  as such. Conclusions and Implications: Encouraging mothers to reflect on how they were fed as , how it may influence their current , and how the relationship between mothering and  obesity is complex are important nutrition education opportunities."
"Parenting practices and overweight status of junior high school students in China: A nationally representative study of 19,487 students from 112 schools",2018,"The  aimed to examine the level of al responsiveness and demandingness for junior high students in China and its association with  weight status; assess if it differs by student socio-demographic characteristics; and to test the association between  and  physical activity. Nationally reative survey data collected from 19,487 students in 112 middle schools across China in 2013-2014 academic year were analyzed in 2016. Children's anthropometrics and perceptions of  practices were accessed by self-administered questionnaire. Multilevel logistic regression models were fit to test the association controlling for  age, sex, school region, and al education. The majority of adolescents reported their s were highly responsive in terms of emotional support and involvement (high: 64.1% vs. low: 9.2%), although more s were not perceived as highly demanding (high: 21.4% vs. low: 35.5%). Children were more likely to be overweight or obese if their s were highly responsive (OR = 1.4 [95% CI: 1.2,1.6]) and demanding (OR = 1.1 [95% CI: 1.0,1.3]) compared to those with medium  scores. Older , boys,  with highly educated s, or in urban schools had greater odds of being overweight or obese by receiving highly responsive  compared to their counterparts. Children with highly demanding or responsive  had longer physical activity duration and higher physical activity participation rates than their counterparts. High responsiveness and demandingness among Chinese s were associated with the risk of  overweight and obesity. Further  is needed to examine the causal relationship between  practices and hood obesity in China."

The Attachment Style Interview (ASI) A support-based adult assessment tool for adoption and fostering practice,2008,"Attachment theory is becoming increasingly influential across health and social care fields in providing explanations of individuals' capacities to achieve effective support, close partner relationships and good  of their own and others' offspring. Adoption and fostering services were among the first to use attachment theory to inform evidence-based practice. While it has been used for the assessment of  capacity and attachment insecurity in , there has been little parallel development of standardised assessments for carers, especially in terms of partner relationship, close support figures and ability to access support. This is a critical element in determining suitability for adoption and fostering carer roles and post-placement support. The Attachment Style Interview (ASI-Bifulco et al, 2002a, b) provides such a tool and concurs with requirements identified for carers in DfES Practice Guidance (Department for Education and Skills, 2006).

"MOTHERS AND FATHERS WORKING MODELS OF CHILDHOOD ATTACHMENT RELATIONSHIPS, PARENTING STYLES, AND CHILD-BEHAVIOR",1992,"This  addresses the question of whether or not s' working models of hood attachments constitute a risk factor for difficulties in current - relations. In a sample of 27 families and their preschool-aged , mother- and father- dyads were observed in separate laboratory play sessions from which ratings of s' and 's behavior were collected. Working models of attachment were assessed using the Adult Attachment Interview (George, Kaplan, & Main, 1984). Results showed that s classified as insecure were less warm and provided less structure in interactions with their  than did s classified as secure. Children of insecure s were less warm toward their s than were  of secure s. Analyses of s' joint attachment classification showed that insecure women married to insecure men were less warm and provided less structure with their  than did mothers in either the insecure-secure or secure-secure dyads. These findings suggest that, in two- families, an insecure working model may be a risk factor for less competent  but that the risk is more pronounced when both s have insecure working models of attachment."
Convergent and discriminant validity of measures of parenting efficacy and control,1997,"Examined the convergent and discriminant validity of the  Attribution Test (PAT; Bugenial, Blue, & Cruzcosa, 1989), the al Locus of Control Scale (PLOC; Campis, Lyman, & prentice-Dunn, 1986), and the  Sense of Competence-Efficacy Scale (PSOC-Efficacy; Johnston & Mash, 1989) in 3 samples of community mothers. In the 1st 2 samples, mothers  completed measures of negative affect and social desirability. In the 3rd sample, the PAT and PSOC-Efficacy scales were administered with measures of adult attachment  and  behavior problems. There was weak support for the convergent validity of the measures. Moreover, the discriminant validity of the measures was not adequately demonstrated. Our  suggest that PLOC and PSOC-Efficacy scores may reflect distress and response  as well as beliefs about . Scores on the PAT, although less influenced by response  and distress, appear to reflect a different dimension of efficacy than that assessed by other self-report measures."
The Role of Individual and Familial Protective Factors in Adolescents' Diet Control,2009,"This  examines a conceptual model linking individual cognitive-behavioral and familial influences to adolescents' poor diet control as a health-risk behavior. A cross-sectional survey collected data from students enrolled in the secondary schools of the Middle Tansylvanian Region, Romania (N = 1977). Self-administered questionnaires were used for data collection. Logistic regression analyses revealed that future-orientation, self-regulation, life purpose,   and al support were all significant protective factors against adolescents' poor diet control. While both individual and familial variables act as protection for girls and younger adolescents, for boys and older adolescents, only al variables are significant."
Differential effects of parenting strategies on  smoking trajectories: A longitudinal assessment over twelve years,2015,"Past studies exhibit mixed findings regarding the effect of  strategies on 's behavior. We propose that it is due to behavioral heterogeneity among  - they differ in sensitivity to al influence - and simultaneously examine the effects of  strategies on a 's: (1) probability to follow a specific trajectory for smoking growth; (2) growth pattern within a particular smoking trajectory; and (3) tobacco dependence at adulthood. Using nationally reative longitudinal data gathered over twelve years, we reveal five distinct smoking trajectories, namely stable nonsmokers (62.5%), gradual escalators (17.5%), rapid escalators (9.4%), stable light smokers (9.3%), and quitters (1.2%).  strategies have differential effects on these segments. The shapes of these trajectories, in turn, affect 's tobacco dependence at adulthood. This  provides a novel profiling approach to depict the typical  in each segment, and offers social workers and policy makers new avenues to design targeted tobacco prevention/cessation programs.

Parental feeding attitudes and styles and  body mass index: Prospective analysis of a gene-environment interaction,2004,"Background. al feeding  were linked to  weight in cross-sectional studies, which were unable to test the direction of effect. Prospective studies can best establish causal relationships among such variables. Objective. We tested the 2-year stability of al feeding attitudes and  and investigated whether these variables predict  body mass index (BMI) z scores 2 years later. We evaluated whether these associations were dependent on 's predisposition to obesity. Methods. Participants were 57 families enrolled in an Infant Growth Study of  born at high risk or low risk for obesity, on the basis of maternal prepregnancy overweight or leanness. Children were evaluated for weight and height at 3, 5, and 7 years of age. Measures of al feeding attitudes and  were ascertained with the Child Feeding Questionnaire at 5 and 7 years of age. Correlation and multiple regression analyses tested whether al feeding  at age 5 predicted increased  BMI z scores 2 years later. Results. al feeding attitudes and  were stable for  ages of 5 to 7 years. With respect to feeding attitudes, perceived responsibility at age 5 predicted reduced  BMI z scores at age 7 among low-risk families, whereas  weight concern and perceived  weight predicted increased  BMI z scores among high-risk families. With respect to feeding , monitoring predicted reduced  BMI z scores at age 7 among low-risk . In contrast, restriction predicted higher BMI z scores and pressure to eat predicted reduced BMI z scores among high-risk . These associations remained significant after controlling for  weight status at age 3. Conclusions. The relationship between al feeding  and  BMI z scores depends on  obesity predisposition, suggesting a gene-environment interaction. Among  predisposed to obesity, elevated  weight appears to elicit restrictive feeding practices, which in turn may produce additional weight gain.  guidelines for overweight prevention may benefit from consideration of  characteristics such as vulnerability to obesity and current weight status."
Authoritative schools: A test of a model to resolve the school effectiveness debate,2004,"School effectiveness  has fueled debate on the importance of a press for academic excellence versus communal values. Research on   offers a theoretical framework that may resolve the debate. We hypothesized that dimensions of  -demandingness (academic press) and responsiveness (communal values)-predict students' mathematics achievement, engagement, and locus of control. HLM analyses of NELS: 88 data on 19,435 eighth-graders partially supported the hypothesis: Students' perceptions of school responsiveness predicted their engagement and internal control. In addition, students in responsive schools had smaller differences in mathematics achievement and internal control attributable to SES, suggesting that responsive schools may increase equity. We offer suggestions for further investigation of the model in hope of resolving the debate. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
A Comparative Study on Parenting of Preschool Children Between the Chinese in China and Chinese Immigrants in the United States,2017,"The goal of this questionnaire-based  was to compare the relative endorsement of specific  patterns among two ethnic Chinese groups rearing preschool : Chinese s in China (N = 117) and first-generation Chinese immigrant s in the United States (N = 94). A significant interaction effect was found between country and gender on the nonreasoning/punitive dimension of authoritarian , revealing that Chinese fathers endorsed this pattern more strongly than both Chinese immigrant fathers and Chinese mothers. There was  a significant interaction effect between country and gender on the practice of shaming/love withdrawal, indicating that Chinese fathers espoused this pattern more strongly than Chinese immigrant fathers and Chinese mothers, but Chinese immigrant mothers endorsed it more strongly than Chinese immigrant fathers. Furthermore, it was revealed that Chinese immigrants endorsed beliefs about maternal involvement more strongly than their Chinese counterparts. The  are discussed in the context of cultural and contextual influences."
Predicting internalizing problems in Chinese : The unique and interactive effects of parenting and  temperament,2013,"The additive and interactive relations of   (authoritative and authoritarian ) and  temperament (anger/frustration, sadness, and effortful control) to 's internalizing problems were examined in a 3.8-year longitudinal  of 425 Chinese  (aged 6-9 years) from Beijing. At Wave 1, s self-reported on their  , and s and teachers rated  temperament. At Wave 2, s, teachers, and  rated 's internalizing problems. Structural equation modeling indicated that the main effect of authoritative  and the interactions of Authoritarian  x Effortful Control and Authoritative  x Anger/Frustration (s' reports only) prospectively and uniquely predicted internalizing problems. The above  did not vary by  sex and remained significant after controlling for co-occurring externalizing problems. These findings suggest that (a)  with low effortful control may be particularly susceptible to the adverse effect of authoritarian  and (b) the benefit of authoritative  may be especially important for  with high anger/frustration."
Relationship between parenting measures and parents and  psychopathological symptoms: a cross-sectional study,2020,"Background Increasing evidence suggests a complex role of family influences, such as the exposure to  psychopathology through  behavior, in -to- psychopathology transmission.  behaviour could re a relevant target of psychoeducative intervention. Given these premises, we aimed to evaluate homotypic and heterotypic relationships between  and  psychopathology, mediated by  behaviours, taking into account the constructs of  and offspring internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Methods Internalizing and externalizing symptoms in 272 clinically-referred subjects (mean age = 14.5 +/- 2.3; F = 23.5%) and their s (mothersn = 272, fathersn = 242) were assessed through the Child Behavior Checklist and the Adult Self Report; four areas of  behaviours were investigated through the Family Life Questionnaire. Multiple mediation models were built, considering mother and father psychopathology scales as independent variables,  measures and family functioning as mediators (Affirmation, Rules, Discipline and Special Allowances),  psychopathology scales as dependent variables and demographic variables as covariates. Results Regression models showed a significant effect of maternal internalizing symptomatology on  externalizing behavioral problems; high levels of maternal pathology predicted high levels of 's psychopathology. A total mediating effect of  measures was found: high levels of internalizing symptoms in mothers predicted low levels of affirmation, which in turn predicted high levels of externalizing psychopathology in . Conclusions Our   confirmed the existence of interdependent links between mothers' psychiatric symptomatology,  behaviour and offspring outcomes, specifically in an Italian context. On a clinical and rehabilitation basis, this work offers suggestions about  practices, specifically maternal, involved in the maintenance of  psychopathology."
Parenting: A genetic-epidemiologic perspective,1996,"Objective: To understand the relation between  and later psychopathology, it is important to clarify the role of genetic and environmental factors in both the elicitation and the provision of  behavior. Method: A 16-item version of the al Bonding Instrument was administered to 1) 606 fathers and 848 mothers of an epidemiologic sample of adult female-female twin pairs, who reported on their  of thew twins; 2) the twins (both members of 546 monozygotic and 390 dizygotic pairs), who reported on the  they had received from their father and mother; 3) co-twins from these pairs, who reported on the  provided by their father and mother to their twin sister; and 4) members of the adult twin pairs (145 monozygotic and 117 dizygotic) who both had , who reported on the  they provided to their offspring. The data were subjected to model fitting decomposing three sources of variance: additive genetic factors; family, or common, environment; and an individual's unique environment. Results: Responses to the al Bonding Instrument produced three factors: al warmth, protectiveness, and authoritarianism. According to s, these factors were largely a common environmental experience for their . Responses from twins, however, indicated that genetic factors played a substantial role in the elicitation of warmth from s and a more modest role in influencing al protectiveness and authoritarianism. While reports of twins and co-twins on protectiveness and authoritarianism yielded similar , analysis of responses from co-twins indicated a degree of importance of genetic factors in eliciting al warmth which was midway between that from s' reports and twins' reports. Answers from twins as s indicated that provision of warmth was substantially heritable, while resemblance between twins in providing protectiveness and authoritarianism was due to family environment. Conclusions: The provision of  is influenced by attitudes derived from the 's family of origin as well as by genetically influenced al temperamental characteristics. The elicitation of  is influenced by temperamental traits of the offspring that are, in turn, under partial genetic control. Genetic factors in both  and  are more important for warmth than for protectiveness or authoritarianism."
How much support is too much? Parenting efficacy and social support,2002,"This paper describes an exploratory  examining  efficacy and social support. Fifty-four low-income mothers from diverse cultural backgrounds responded to a questionnaire. The questionnaire included  scales (the  Locus of Control Scale and the Conflict Tactic Scale), social support scales (Perceived Social Support-Family, Perceived Social Support-Friends, Index of Family Relations, Network Orientation Scale and a loneliness scale) and a social network map. Nonparametric statistical measures were used to analyze  data. Results indicate differences on  measures depending on network size. Mothers with larger social networks were more likely to utilize an aggressive  of  and were less satisfied with the family support they received. Results from this  raise questions about the characteristics of healthy or helpful social networks."
Family Management Style and Psychosocial Health of Children with Chronic Conditions,2021,"This  aimed to examine the associations among variables related to the sociocultural context (including social support,  stress, and s' perceived severity of their 's condition), the ease or difficulty of family management, and psychosocial outcomes of  with chronic conditions. This cross-sectional  analyzed a convenience sample of 277 s of  with chronic diseases who had been receiving follow-up care for at least 6 months at a university hospital located in a metropolitan area. Family members answered a questionnaire on demographics, illness characteristics, perceived severity of the 's chronic condition, social support, the  Stress Index, the Pediatric Symptom Checklist, and the Korean version of the Family Management Measure (FaMM). The six scales of the FaMM were divided into two domains, corresponding to ease and difficulty of family management, respectively. PASW version 18.0 and AMOS version 22.0 with bootstrapping analysis were used. Social support,  stress, and perceived disease severity significantly affected both ease and difficulty of family management. Sufficient social support, low  stress, and a less severe chronic condition of the  were associated with ease of family management. Both ease and difficulty of family management explained 73.9% of the variance in 's psychosocial problems and showed significant direct effects. Care plans for chronically ill  and their families should be designed to promote positive aspects of family management by decreasing  stress and enhancing social support, thereby making family management easier and reducing the risk of psychosocial problems in  with chronic conditions."
Parental rejection in early adolescence predicts a persistent ADHD symptom trajectory across adolescence,,"Despite a general decrease of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms during adolescence, these may persist in some individuals but not in others. Prior cross-sectional studies have shown that   and their interaction with candidate genes are associated with ADHD symptoms. However, there is a lack of longitudinal  examining the independent and interactive effects of  and plasticity genes in predicting the course of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms across adolescence. Here, we investigated how  perceived their s'   (i.e., rejection, overprotection, and emotional warmth) at the age of 11, and their interaction with DRD4,MAOA, and 5-HTTLPR genotypes on -reported ADHD symptoms at three time points (mean ages 11.1, 13.4, and 16.2 years) in 1730 adolescents from the TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS). Growth Mixture Modeling in Mplus identified four ADHD symptom trajectories: low, moderate stable, high decreasing, and high persistent. Perceived al rejection predicted class membership in the high persistent trajectory compared to the other classes (p < 0.001, odds ratios between 2.14 and 3.74). Gene-environment interactions were not significantly related to class membership. Our  indicate a role of perceived al rejection in the persistence of ADHD symptoms. Perceived al rejection should, therefore, be taken into consideration during prevention and treatment of ADHD in young adolescents."
European American and African American Mothers' Beliefs About Parenting and Disciplining Infants: A Mixed-Method Analysis,2010,"Objective.  is a response to and supported by s' cultural and personal beliefs about what they should do to promote their 's development. Our goal was to explore the belief systems that appear to motivate some mothers to be more negative or use physical discipline in infancy and to determine whether those beliefs are related to observed  . Design. Using a mixed-methods approach, we first examined this issue qualitatively (n = 25) and then tested the qualitative findings using quantitative analyses (n = 134). Participants were mothers and their infants between the ages of 2 and 18 months. Results. Ethnographic interviews revealed that mothers primarily held 1 of 2 contrasting beliefs about why  misbehave and how s should respond to bad behavior. Many mothers said they avoid using physical punishment with their infants because infants are not able to clearly understand right and wrong. In contrast, some mothers believed that infants can misbehave intentionally and need to be punished to stop the bad behavior and learn to respect the mother's authority. Subsequent quantitative analyses supported this finding. Mothers who expressed concerns about bad behavior and spoiling interacted less positively with their infants during free-play interactions at 6 and 12 months of age, but this trend was stronger among European American than among African American mothers. Conclusions. Findings suggest possible race differences in beliefs about spoiling and infant intentionality that aply support the use of physical punishment with young , and that efficacious  education programs might focus on s' beliefs about whether infants can intentionally misbehave and concerns about spoiling in efforts to reduce physical punishment and increase responsive  ."
Interconnectedness: The Grandparents Role in Childbearing and Parenting,2015,"Grands play a vital role in the lives of expectant mothers as well their grand. The interconnected nature of generations may affect  , feeding preferences, safety of infant as well as maternal role attainment. Geographical distance, culture, maternal and paternal relationship with s and in-laws, as well as age of the grand, may alter the role that grands play and subsequently the influence they have over bearing and . It is important for birth educators to acknowledge the role of the grand and work to assess their knowledge of current care and safety practices, including their role in infant caretaking responsibilities. A thorough assessment will allow educators to provide educational and support interventions and resources as appropriate to both women and grands."

Childrearing and  participation in Jamaican families,2008,"Existing  in Jamaica on  and families has focused on family structure and function. The recent worldwide focus on the rights of , particularly young , has highlighted the absence of  on  rights in Jamaica. This article explores the implementation of protection and participation rights within the family, with a specific focus on protection from harsh punishment and abuse, including harsh work. Six  focus groups with 60  and eight  focus groups with 44 adults were held, with focus groups being socio-demographically reative of urban inner-city, urban middle-class and rural groups. Children were between 7 and 12 years and s between 24 and 45 years. The  described a wide range of family structures. Harsh discipline was more common than demonstrated affection and approval, and levels of meaningful  participation were low across classes. The majority of s believed in exercising strong authority, valued obedience and manners in their , and defended the use of corporal punishment. Many s described the interventions to amend their own life scripts in the ways they raised their . This ed in al attention to 's education and economic advancement, provision of physical comforts and emotional support, altered approaches to corporal punishment and guidance on relationships. Using reflections of their own hood, the development of amended scripts for s is recommended as a powerful tool to encourage greater participatory rights for  and improve protection rights by reducing the use of harsh disciplinary measures and requirements for adult forms of work."

"Raising Middle-class Black Children: Parenting Priorities, Actions and Strategies",2013,"The enrolment of middle-class  in extra-curricular activities is a recent trend in many affluent countries. It is part of what Annette Lareau refers to as a classed   - concerted cultivation' which sees the  as a project with skills and talents to be fostered and developed. Controversially, Lareau argued that class, rather than race, was the most influential factor in determining this particular  . In relation to our  with Black middle-class s, we argue that the task for the er is attempting to understand how race and class differently interact in particular contexts. We conclude that a focus on Black Caribbean heritage families can further develop the concept of concerted cultivation, and demonstrate the complex ways in which, for these families, such a strategy is a tool of social reproduction but  functions as attempted protection against racism in White mainstream society."
"Emotion regulation difficulties, perceived parenting and personality as predictors of health-risk behaviours among adolescents",,"Health-Risk Behaviours (HRBs) are significant antecedent conditions of adverse health outcomes among adolescents, and their prevention requires an in-depth understanding of associated factors. Like any other behaviour, HRBs may be an outcome of a complex interplay between personal and situational factors that determines our responses. Among other factors, emotional tendencies, specific behavioural patterns, and psychosocial environment may be the significant factors working at different hierarchical positions within a system and guiding human behaviours, including HRBs. Previous studies have explored the role of these specific factors in developing and maintaining HRBs, but mainly among the adult population, and no conclusive  could be observed regarding their contribution to HRBs in adolescents. The   explored the predictability of adolescents' engagement in HRBs with regard to three reations of the mentioned factors, i.e., emotion regulation difficulties, perceived  practices and personality traits. A total of 723 (Males = 440) adolescents (M-age = 16.05, SD = 1.1) provided relevant information on the standardized questionnaires. Structural equation modelling was applied to test the stated hypotheses. Analysis revealed that the adolescents who reported more difficulty regulating one's emotions, perceived  practice as maladaptive, scored high on neuroticism and low on conscientiousness, showed more engagement in HRBs than their counterparts. Further, the findings indicated that emotion regulation difficulties and perceived  practices are stronger predictors of HRBs than personality traits. Interventional programs targeting HRBs among adolescents should address specific facets of emotional dysregulation and sensitise s about their role in moderating adolescents' HRBs."
GENETIC QUESTIONS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL-STUDIES - DIFFERENTIAL PARENTING AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY IN ADOLESCENCE,1995,"Background: Recent genetic evidence suggests that the most important environmental influences on normal and pathologic development are those that are not shared by siblings in the same family. We sought to determine the relationship between differences in   and depressive symptoms and antisocial behavior in adolescence, and to compare the influence of these nonshared experiences with genetic influences. Methods: We studied 708 families with at least two same-sexed adolescent siblings who were monozygotic twins (93 families), dizygotic twins (99 families), ordinary siblings (95 families), full siblings in step families (181 families), half siblings in step families (110 families), and genetically unrelated siblings in step families (130 families). Data on   were collected by questionnaire and by video recording of interaction between s and . Results: Almost 60% of variance in adolescent antisocial behavior and 37% of variance in depressive symptoms could be accounted for by conflictual and negative al behavior directed specifically at the adolescent. In contrast, when a  directed harsh, aggressive, explosive, and inconsistent  toward the sibling, we found less psychopathologic outcome in the adolescent. Conclusions:  behavior directed specifically at each  in the family is a major correlate of symptoms in adolescents. Furthermore, harsh al behavior directed at a sibling may have protective effects for adolescents, a phenomenon we can the ''sibling barricade.''"
Differential susceptibility effects of oxytocin gene (OXT) polymorphisms and perceived parenting on social anxiety among adolescents,2018,"Social anxiety is one of the most commonly reported mental health problems among adolescents, and it has been suggested that   influences an adolescent's level of anxiety. A context-dependent effect of oxytocin on human social behavior has been proposed; however,  on the oxytocin gene (OXT) has mostly been reported without considering contextual factors. This  investigated the interactions between   and polymorphic variations in the OXT gene in association with social anxiety symptoms in a community sample of adolescents (n = 1,359). Two single nucleotide polymorphisms linked to OXT, rs4813625 and rs2770378, were genotyped. Social anxiety and perceived   were assessed by behavioral questionnaires. In interaction models adjusted for sex, significant interaction effects with   were observed for both variants in relation to social anxiety. The nature of the interactions was in line with the differential susceptibility framework for rs4813625, whereas for rs2770378 the  indicated a diathesis-stress type of interaction. The findings may be interpreted from the perspective of the social salience hypothesis of oxytocin, with rs4813625 affecting social anxiety levels along a perceived unsafe-safe social context dimension."

Family factors and fruit and vegetable consumption in Chinese preschool  living in Hong Kong,2018,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the association of various family factors with 's fruit and vegetable (FV) intake. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional analysis of data from 601 - dyads with  aged three to six years old was conducted. s completed questionnaires on 's FV intake,  , al feeding practices, family functioning, television viewing at mealtimes and frequency of family meals. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between various family factors and the likelihood of meeting the 's daily FV recommendation with adjustment for different demographic variables. Findings Multivariate model adjusting for sociodemographic data indicated that meeting vegetable recommendation was associated with lower frequency of dining with grands (Odds ratio (OR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89-0.99, p=0.031) and positively associated with s using more desirable al feeding practices (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.09-1.21, p<0.001). Meeting fruit recommendation was associated with s using more desirable al feeding practices (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.09-1.17, p<0.001), higher frequency of dining with grands (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00-1.10, p=0.041), lower frequency of dining with father (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.98, p=0.014) and higher score on authoritative   (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.08, p=0.009). Originality/value This  highlights the potential protective roles of various family factors, in particular authoritative   and al feeding practices, such as role modeling, moderate restrictive practices for less healthy foods, avoidance of forced feeding, and not using junk food as reward in relation to meeting FV recommendation in . The role of grands in influencing the young 's eating behaviors within the Chinese family warrants further investigation."
"The association between identity status, perceived parenting strategies, and mental health of in-school adolescents in South-West Nigeria: A descriptive survey",2020,"Aim: This  was aimed to determine the level of identity development, its associations with perceived  strategies, and the mental health of in-school adolescents. Background: Adolescence is marked with the struggle for a balance between subjective psychological differentiation and connection to others, which drives identity formation and guides the path to mental health. Concerning, the developmental processes that incite or escalate adolescents' mental health problems, theories have postulated that social interactions with s have consequences for the identity status and mental health of adolescents. Methods: A  on 286 in-school adolescents was conducted in Ibadan, between February and April 2016. Data were collected using the Assessment of Identity Development in Adolescents, Scale of  Style, and the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaires. The analysis was done with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 21, using Student's t-test, ANOVA, and correlation statistics. Results: The males and younger adolescents, had higher scores for identity discontinuity and incoherence. The scores for perceived mothers' responsiveness correlates positively with the adolescents' score for identity discontinuity (rs= 0.173; P = 0.03), while perceived mothers' demandingness correlates positively with adolescents' identity discontinuity (rs= 0.211; P < 0.001) and incoherence (rs= 0.180; P = 0.01). Identity discontinuity (rs= 0.209; P = 0.00) and incoherence (rs= 0.294; P = 0.00) correlated positively with emotional problems while identity incoherence correlated with conduct problems (rs= 0.211; P = 0.03). Conclusion: During the process of the adolescents' self-actualization, there is a tendency for conflict with the s as the primary authority figure. Hence, the adolescents' perception of  strategies can affect their identity development and mental health."

NARRATIVES FROM COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATION STAFF AND BLACK AND COLOURED MOTHERS IN SOUTH AFRICA: A QUALITATIVE STUDY ON THE IMPACT OF PARTICIPATION IN PARENTING PROGRAMS ON MATERNAL BEHAVIORS,2020,"The purpose of this qualitative case  was to explore perceptions of the impact of program participation on   and behavioral changes using observations and in-depth semi-structured interviews with Black and Coloured staff and mothers at a community-based organization (CBO) in the Western Cape Province (WCP) in South Africa (SA). Purposive sampling was utilized in this  via the CBO and narratives from a total of twenty-three (twelve mothers and eleven staff) interviews form the basis of this manuscript. Data was collected between January - February 2017 and was analyzed through the phenomenological and inductive thematic analysis approach. The staff interviews revealed that  abandonment and neglect and the abuse of women are the two main environmental contextual factors that impact program participation. According to staff, improved self-esteem and positive life changes were identified as successful outcomes of participant involvement. The  interviews provided examples of emotional issues such as domestic abuse and personal issues with alcohol and drugs as individual factors that impact their program participation. Changes in   was identified as successful outcomes among  participants. The goal of this  was to provide much-needed insight into this community by ing a variety of voices, specifically Black and Coloured men and women, that are underreported in the literature. Findings from this  adds to the knowledge of community-based  programs (CBPPs) for low-income and underserved populations in SA and internationally."
Bringing Work Home: Gender and Parenting Correlates of Work-Family Guilt among Parents of Toddlers,2017,"Anecdotal evidence abounds suggesting that as compared to fathers, mothers report greater guilt regarding the negative impact of work on family (WIF-guilt), yet shockingly few quantitative studies have evaluated gender differences or correlates of WIF-guilt. In five studies, we provide an in-depth exploration of s' feelings of guilt regarding perceived negative impacts on their  that arise from addressing work over familial responsibilities. We accomplish the following: (1) examine the validity of a novel self-report questionnaire of WIF-guilt (Work-Interfering-With-Family Guilt Scale [WIFGS]), (2) assess gender differences in WIF-guilt in s of young  (ages 1-3), as well as whether these differences are moderated by WIF-conflict and work demand (number of hours worked), and (3) examine whether higher WIF-guilt predicts more permissive . WIFGS scores were predictably associated with related psychological constructs. Mothers reported significantly higher levels of WIF-guilt than fathers. These effects were enhanced among mothers with high WIF-conflict and a high number of working hours. Consistent with anecdotal accounts and theory, WIF-guilt was associated with higher  permissiveness. Results provide directions for additional  on s' emotional experiences."
The parents' tale: Why parents resist the educational use of smartphones at schools?,2020,"This  examined the level of al resistance to the use of smartphones in schools, as well as the predictors and the factors underlying al resistance. Data was collected from a sample of 220 s of elementary and secondary school students who completed an online ques-tionnaire. The participants ranked four different factors for resisting and rejecting the use of smartphones in schools: social, environmental, economic and pedagogical. s' actual resistance level was  measured, from no resistance, through passive resistance, to active resistance. Furthermore, the  examined the association between al resistance and four  : authoritarian, authoritative, permissive, and uninvolved, as well as asso-ciations with demographic and socioeconomic variables. About two-thirds of the s expressed resistance toward the use of smartphones in school, and more than half of them expressed active resistance to such use. Social and economic factors were reported to underlie resistance to the use of smartphones in school to a great extent, whereas pedagogical resistance factor was reported to a low extent in all al resistance levels Nevertheless, pedagogical and social resistance factors predicted a high level of al resistance. Authoritative   was found to be a negative predictor of al resistance. Implications of the findings are discussed in relation to educational theory and the challenges of policy-makers who cope with al resistance towards the integration of smartphones in school learning."
Self-esteem as a mediator in the longitudinal relationship between dysfunctional parenting and peer attachment in early adolescence,2020,"This  investigated the causal relationship between dysfunctional  and peer attachment, as well as the longitudinal mediating role of self-esteem, in early adolescence. Moreover, this  examined whether there were sex differences in these longitudinal relationships. This  used three-wave longitudinal data-measured at the fifth grade of elementary school, the sixth grade of elementary school, and the first grade of middle school-of 1,831 adolescents (935 boys and 896 girls; mean age = 10.98 +/- 0.17 years at the first wave) who participated in the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey. Autoregressive cross-lagged modeling analysis revealed the following: regardless of adolescents' sex, the negative effects of dysfunctional  on self-esteem and the positive effects of self-esteem on peer attachment were all significant over time, while the levels of dysfunctional , self-esteem, and peer attachment all remained stable over the three-year period. Furthermore, self-esteem partially mediated the longitudinal relationship between dysfunctional  and peer attachment for girls, whereas self-esteem completely mediated the relationship for boys. The  suggest the needs for lifelong al education-provided from elementary school to hood-and for s' and teachers' continued attention to peer relationships in early adolescence. Further, tailored interventions should consider the degree of vulnerability of dysfunctional  by adolescents' sex and promote their self-esteem."
Bringing Out the Best in Parenting: Translating Community-Engaged Research on Adversity and Parenting to Policy,2021,"Background: Although positive  protects  against adversity, experiences of adversity can disrupt protective  practices. The impact of adversity on the lived experiences of s living in poverty is lacking attention to specific aspects of the socioecological context. Objectives: This qualitative   provides an in-depth exploration of  goals, attitudes, and values as well as the mesosystem and chronosystem factors that influence  among s of young  exposed to adversity. The authors  sought to translate  findings into policy initiatives to benefit local families. Methods: Low-income, primarily Black/African American s of young  participated in in-depth, semistructured interviews regarding contextual influences on their . Bronfenbrenner's Social-Ecological Model guided coding and analysis. Our Community Action Board (CAB), which endeavors to prevent toxic stress and promote resilience among  and families impacted by adverse hood experiences (ACEs) aided with   design, implementation, and interpretation of the findings. Results: Healthy, supportive  goals and values are hampered by challenging interactions with various levels of the socioecological system. Findings highlight the relevance of the mesosystem and chronosystem to  in this sample. Conclusions: Practice implications include strength-based and trauma-informed  interventions. In addition, greater awareness of historical discrimination and intergenerational trauma are needed among systems serving urban  and families to build more effective partnerships with families. Policy initiatives informed by the  and our CAB are described."
Can Robots Help Working Parents with Childcare? Optimizing Childcare Functions for Different Parenting Characteristics,2022,"Is it true that s always prioritize educational effectiveness when selecting care services? The current  identified the potential requirements of dual-income s toward social robots' diverse care functions (e.g., socialization, education, entertainment, and consultation). The  revealed that al attitudes toward robots were made more positive by all the care functions of robots except for their educational features. Furthermore, s' expectations of care functions varied based on their  characteristics. Spectral clustering analysis identified distinctive   (e.g., family-oriented, work-oriented, noninterventional, and dominant), and multigroup structural equation modeling suggested that the impact of robots' socialization function was significant in all  groups, while other care functions exerted limited influence according to specific  . In addition, 's characteristics were found to alter s' preferences for each care function. These  offer practical implications for the early adoption of care robots through predetermining s' acceptability based on their specific  characteristics."
The effectiveness of a web-based Dutch parenting program to prevent overweight in  9-13 years of age: study protocol for a two-armed cluster randomized controlled trial,2015,"Background: Although al support is an important component in overweight prevention programs for , current programs pay remarkably little attention to the role of . To close this gap, we developed a web-based  program for s entitled Making a healthy deal with your . This e-learning program can be incorporated into existing prevention programs, thereby improving these interventions by reinforcing the role of  and providing s with practical tools for use in everyday situations in order to stimulate a healthy life. Here, we report the  design of a  to determine the effectiveness of our e-learning program. Methods/Design: The effectiveness of an e-learning program was studied in a two-armed cluster randomized controlled trial. s of  9-13 years of age who live in the Nijmegen region, the Netherlands, and who participated in the existing school-based overweight prevention program Scoring for Health were invited to participate in this . Our goal was to recruit 322 - dyads. At the school grade level, s were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (which received e-learning and a brochure) or the control group (which received only the brochure); the participants were stratified by ethnicity. Measurements were taken from both the s and the  at baseline, and then 5 and 12 months after baseline. Primary outcomes included the 's dietary and sedentary behavior, and level of physical activity. Secondary outcomes included general  , specific  practices (e.g., set of rules, modeling, and monitoring), and al self-efficacy. Discussion: We hypothesize that  of s who follow the e-learning program will have a healthier diet, will be less sedentary, and will have a higher level of physical activity compared to the  in the control group. If the e-learning program is found to be effective, it can be incorporated into existing overweight prevention programs for  (e.g., Scoring for Health), as well as activities regarding Youth Health Care."
"Factors Associated with the Referral of Anxious Children to Mental Health Care: the Influence of Family Functioning, Parenting, Parental Anxiety and Child Impairment",2015,"This  aims to identify factors that predict the mental health care referral of anxious . In total, 249  and families, aged 8-13 years, participated: 73  were referred with anxiety disorders to mental health care [mean (M) age =10.28, standard deviation (SD) =1.35], 176 non-referred anxious  recruited in primary schools (M age =9.94, SD =1.22). Child anxiety and other disorders were assessed with semi-structured interviews. Child anxiety symptoms, behavioural problems, al anxiety, the   overprotection, autonomy encouragement, rejection, and the family functioning dimensions control and relational functioning, were assessed with , father and mother report on questionnaires. The summed interference rating of 's anxiety disorders was a predictor of referral, consistent over  and  reports, but not comorbidity. Most family and  variables did not predict referral, nor differed between the referred and non-referred sample. Contrary to our hypothesis, maternal self-reported anxiety decreased the odds of referral and  reported al autonomy granting increased, while  reported overprotection decreased the odds of referral. The impairment for the  due to the number and severity of their anxiety disorder(s) is, based on , mother and father report associated with referral. This indicates that those who need it most, receive clinical treatment. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"Association between parenting practices and 's dietary intake, activity behavior and development of body mass index: the KOALA Birth Cohort Study",2011,"Background: Insights into the effects of energy balance-related  practices on 's diet and activity behavior at an early age is warranted to determine which practices should be recommended and to whom. The purpose of this  was to examine  and  background correlates of energy balance-related  practices at age 5, as well as the associations of these practices with 's diet, activity behavior, and body mass index (BMI) development. Methods: Questionnaire data originated from the KOALA Birth Cohort Study for ages 5 (N = 2026) and 7 (N = 1819). Linear regression analyses were used to examine the association of  and  background characteristics with  practices (i.e., diet- and activity-related restriction, monitoring and stimulation), and to examine the associations between these  practices and 's diet (in terms of energy intake, dietary fiber intake, and added sugar intake) and activity behavior (i.e., physical activity and sedentary time) at age 5, as well as BMI development from age 5 to age 7. Moderation analyses were used to examine whether the associations between the  practices and  behavior depended on  characteristics. Results: Several  and  background characteristics were associated with the  practices. Dietary monitoring, stimulation of healthy intake and stimulation of physical activity were associated with desirable energy balance-related behaviors (i.e., dietary intake and/or activity behavior) and desirable BMI development, whereas restriction of sedentary time showed associations with undesirable behaviors and BMI development. Child eating  and weight status, but not  gender or activity , moderated the associations between  practices and behavior. Dietary restriction and monitoring showed weaker, or even undesirable associations for  with a deviant eating , whereas these practices showed associations with desirable behavior for normal eaters. By contrast, stimulation to eat healthy worked particularly well for  with a deviant eating  or a high BMI. Conclusion: Although most energy balance-related  practices were associated with desirable behaviors, some practices showed associations with undesirable  behavior and weight outcomes. Only al stimulation showed desirable associations with regard to both diet and activity behavior. The interaction between  and  characteristics in the association with behavior calls for  that is tailored to the individual ."

A model of adolescent parenting: The role of cognitive readiness to parent,1999,"Although Belsky's (1984) model of  captures much of the variability in adult , it is likely incomplete as an adequate account of adolescent . To test an expanded model of adolescent , we gathered multiple measures of four prenatal maternal variables (cognitive readiness, personal adjustment, intelligence, and social supports) during the last trimester of pregnancy, and two variables when infants were 6 months of age (perceived  characteristics and ). Structural modeling procedures then were used to identify the direct and indirect paths that led to  skill and  in a sample of 135 adolescent mothers and their infants. Only 9.6% of the sample was married, and few held stable, meaningful employment. These variables, as well as the quality of emotional and instrumental support, did not enter into causal networks related to  practices. in contrast, maternal intelligence and personal adjustment influenced cognitive readiness to  that, in turn, was directly related to  as well as to  characteristics at 6 months of age."
"Socio-economic status, parenting practices and early learning at French kindergartens",2014,"The   tests the hypothesis that al values and educational practices are intermediary variables between the socio-economic status (SES) of families and early learning in . Our empirical  was based on 299 s with  in their final year at eight French kindergartens. We constructed an explanatory theoretical model of early learning that brings together variables relating to al values, al educational  and educational practices linked to schooling. Path analyses were used to determine whether our model was consistent with our field data. Findings suggest that SES influences al values in education. We  found that SES directly influences al educational . As previous  has shown, high SES families tend to be more responsive to their 's needs but are  more demanding of their  than other families. Results are discussed."
"Associations Between Parenting, Media Use, Cumulative Risk, and Children's Executive Functioning",2014,"Objective: This  was designed to examine how  , media exposure, and cumulative risk were associated with executive functioning (EF) during early hood. Methods: A nationally reative group of US s/caregivers (N = 1156) with 1  between 2 and 8 years participated in a telephone survey. s were asked to report on their 's exposure to television, music, and book reading through a 24-hour time diary. s  reported a host of demographic and  variables as well as questions on their 's EF. Results: Separate multiple regressions for preschool (2-5 years) and school-aged (6-8 years)  grouped by cumulative risk were conducted.   moderated the risks of exposure to background television on EF for high-risk preschool-age . Educational TV exposure served as a buffer for high-risk school-aged . Cumulative risk, age, and  quality interacted with a number of the exposure effects. Conclusions: The  showed a complex pattern of associations between cumulative risk, , and media exposure with EF during early hood. Consistent with the American Academy of Pediatrics, these findings support the recommendation that background television should be turned off when a  is in the room and suggest that exposure to high-quality content across multiple media platforms may be beneficial."
"Risk factors for antenatal depression, postnatal depression and parenting stress",2008,"Background: Given that the prevalence of antenatal and postnatal depression is high, with estimates around 13%, and the consequences serious, efforts have been made to identify risk factors to assist in prevention, identification and treatment. Most risk factors associated with postnatal depression have been well ed, whereas predictors of antenatal depression have been less ed. Risk factors associated with early  stress have not been widely ed, despite the strong link with depression. The aim of this  was to further elucidate which of some previously identified risk factors are most predictive of three outcome measures: antenatal depression, postnatal depression and  stress and to examine the relationship between them. Methods: Primipara and multiparae women were recruited antenatally from two major hoitals as part of the beyondblue National Postnatal Depression Program [1]. In this subsidiary , 367 women completed an additional large battery of validated questionnaires to identify risk factors in the antenatal period at 26-32 weeks gestation. A subsample of these women (N = 161)  completed questionnaires at 10-12 weeks postnatally. Depression level was measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Results: Regression analyses identified significant risk factors for the three outcome measures. (1). Significant predictors for antenatal depression: low self-esteem, antenatal anxiety, low social support, negative cognitive , major life events, low income and history of abuse. (2). Significant predictors for postnatal depression: antenatal depression and a history of depression while  controlling for concurrent  stress, which was a significant variable. Antenatal depression was identified as a mediator between seven of the risk factors and postnatal depression. (3). Postnatal depression was the only significant predictor for  stress and  acted as a mediator for other risk factors. Conclusion: Risk factor profiles for antenatal depression, postnatal depression and  stress differ but are interrelated. Antenatal depression was the strongest predictor of postnatal depression, and in turn postnatal depression was the strongest predictor for  stress. These  provide clinical direction suggesting that early identification and treatment of perinatal depression is important."
Impact of Parents' Knowledge about the Development of Self-Esteem in Adolescents and Their Parenting Practice on the Self-Esteem and Suicidal Behavior of Urban High School Students in Nepal,2020,"Background: Suicide is the third leading cause of death in adolescents worldwide, self-esteem is a strong protective factor, and s may be able to provide interventions. This cross-sectional  aimed to determine how s can help enhance their adolescent's self-esteem and prevent suicidal behavior among adolescents in Nepal. Methods: Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to adolescents aged 13-19 years and their s at eight high schools in three provinces in Nepal (n= 575 pairs). The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics (bivariate and multivariate regression analyses). Results: The mean self-esteem score of adolescents according to the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale was 16.59, and the prevalence of suicidal behavior was 11.3%. 's knowledge about the development of self-esteem in adolescents was significantly positively related to  practice (communication, support, positive reinforcement, etc.) (B = 1.0, 95% confidence interval, CI 0.89-1.11) and authoritative   (B = 0.2, 95% CI 0.15-0.25). al authoritativeness was positively associated with the self-esteem of their adolescents (B = 0.1, 95% CI 0.01-0.18), while adolescents with authoritarian s were prone to suicidal risk behavior (adjusted odds ratio, AOR = 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.19). Conclusion: Counseling to s based on our findings would be helpful to enhance the self-esteem and prevent suicidal risk behavior in their adolescent ."
Supernanny's Solutions for Families: An Ethnographic Content Analysis of Parenting Messages on Reality Television,2012," messages in 15 episodes of the television show Supernanny were investigated through an ethnographic content analysis. Using feminist, social learning, and cultivation theories, nine themes emerged: Children are Misbehaving, s Need Help, Maintain Control, Don't Be Harsh, Be a Couple, Engage with Kids, Techniques and Skills, Change Takes Work, and It Works. Results showed that mothers were frequently being told to seize control of their  and employ certain  techniques. Fathers were encouraged to help with housework, engage with their , and not be harsh. Issues related to the themes, as well as implications of the  for  educators and clinicians, are discussed."
The effect of parental style on bullying and cyber bullying behaviors and the mediating role of peer attachment relationships: A longitudinal study,2018,"The purpose of the   was the examination of the longitudinal effect of al  on short-term changes in conventional and cyber forms of bullying/victimization, and the investigation of the mediating role of peer attachment relationships on this effect. The participants were 861  and adolescents (52% girls, M-age = 11.72 years) attending Cyprus public institutions. Students provided information during three measurement points. There was a six and a 12 week interval among the three measurement points, respectively. The findings of the  indicated that  seems to be a significant predictor of all forms of bullying/victimization, conventional and cyber, in early adolescents, even when accounting for bullying/victimization levels eighteen weeks back. More importantly,  showed that the effect of al  on bullying forms was mediated by peer attachment relationships. Results are discussed in the light of theoretical and practical implications."
Parents or Peers? Predictors of Prosocial Behavior and Aggression: A Longitudinal Study,2019,"The aim of this longitudinal  was to determine the associations among peer attachment, warmth from the mother and father, strict control by the mother and father, prosocial behavior, and physical and verbal aggression in adolescence. Few longitudinal studies have examined how peer attachment and   of the mother and father relate to prosocial behavior and aggression. Participants were 192 boys and 255 girls (M = 14.70 years; SD = 0.68) in wave 1. In the  participated 11 schools. For three successive years, participants reported on their fathers' and mothers' warmth and strict control, peer attachment, prosocial behavior, and aggression. Structural equations modeling was employed to explore two longitudinal models. Results show the influence of the mother and father on prosocial and aggression during adolescence. In addition, strong peer attachment predicted prosocial behavior in subsequent years. Therefore, the findings indicate that despite the increasingly important role of friends during the transition from hood to adolescence,   play a key role in the personal and social development of their . Programs aimed at preventing aggression should be designed considering the importance of stimulating and strengthening prosocial behavior, peer attachment and a family environment of affect, support and communication."
Are Schemas Passed on? A Study on the Association Between Early Maladaptive Schemas in Parents and Their Offspring and the Putative Translating Mechanisms,2018,"Background: According to Young's schema theory, Early Maladaptive Schemas (EMSs) arise due to the violation of core emotional needs during hood. It seems likely that s have difficulties in satisfying their 's emotional needs if they have high levels of EMSs themselves. Aims: This  investigated whether the extent of EMSs in s is associated with the extent of EMSs in their offspring. Moreover, we tested for two putative mechanisms that account for this association: al coping  and  behaviour. Methods: Sixty dyads of s (mother or father) and their adult  (N = 120), recruited from the general population, completed the Young Schema Questionnaire. The s rated their schema coping  and the  retrospectively rated the  of the participating . Results: As expected, s' EMSs were significantly associated with EMSs in their offspring. This association was accounted for by the al coping  Overcompensation and the adverse  that the  remembered. The al coping  Avoidance did not account for the association. Conclusions: This  provides preliminary evidence for the notion that EMSs are passed on from one generation to the next via al coping and . Our findings thus support the assumption of schema theory that EMSs are connected to the family environment in terms of adverse . If further confirmed, this has relevant implications for family-based interventions."
PARENTING IN THE CONTEXT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE: UNIQUE STRESSES AND OUTCOMES,2009,"Research shows that 20% to 38% of women experience domestic violence during their lifetime (Tjaden & Thoennes, 2000), and women may be particularly vulnerable to partner abuse during the bearing years. As such, millions of young  are exposed to DV and are ed primarily by battered women. The notable prevalence of DV indicates that its effect on  outcomes requires close examination. As one might expect, existing  has found that DV generally has a devastating impact on  capacities (Holden et al., 1998; Levendosky & Graham-Bermann, 2000; 2001). A few studies that have examined the impact of DV on  during the perinatal period have found that  is already compromised during pregnancy and shortly after birth as a  of DV (Dayton, Levendosky, Davidson, & Bogat, 2007; Huth-Bocks, Levendosky, Theran, & Bogat, 2004). Similarly, other studies have found that DV negatively impacts mothers' displays of sensitivity, encouragement, and guidance during -infant interactions (Sokolowski et al., 2008). These  suggest that DV interferes with an adaptive transition to hood and the earliest forms of , which are known to affect long-term hood outcomes. A number of studies have  found that mothers of preschool and school-age  who are exposed to DV report significantly higher  stress compared to non-battered women (Holden et al., 1998; Levendosky & Graham-Bermann, 1998; 2000; Ritchie & Holden, 1998).  stress, in turn, is associated with more negative and less positive  behaviors (e.g., Holden et al., 1998, Huth-Bocks & Hughes, 2008) and poor  outcomes (Levendosky & Graham-Bermann, 1998). Not surprisingly, DV is  associated with other  deficits such as less supportive behaviors, less  effectiveness and -centeredness (Graham-Bermann & Levendosky, 1998a; Levendosky 8c Graham-Bermann, 2001), and greater - hostility and aggression (Holden et al., 1998) during the preschool and school-age years, although there appear to be a subset of women who are resilient and don't experience impairments in . In conclusion,  has demonstrated that DV is surprisingly common among mothers and has deleterious effects on a variety of  outcomes in most battered women. This chapter includes a thorough review of the empirical literature documenting the relationship between DV and  outcomes beginning in pregnancy and lasting throughout hood."
Parenting and internalizing and externalizing problems in Moroccan immigrant youth in the Netherlands,2007,"This  explores the relationship of  to internalizing and externalizing problems in Moroccan immigrant youth in the Netherlands. Interviews were conducted with 713 Moroccan immigrant s, using the Child Behavior Checklist and the Nijmegen Rearing Questionnaire. Child rearing varied with socioeconomic status and psychological acculturation level of the , and gender and age of the . In accordance with studies in Western populations, high levels of affection and monitoring were associated with low levels of problem behavior and high levels of discipline were associated with high levels of problem behavior. However, in contrast to studies in Western populations, a positive relationship was revealed between affection and discipline, and the univariate associations between discipline and problem behavior were modest. Discipline and internalizing problems were unrelated in low SES families, whereas a positive relationship was found in high SES families. The relationship between monitoring and externalizing problems was age-specific: We found a negative association for adolescents and no association for ."
Maternal ADHD Symptoms and Physical Child Abuse Risk: A Multi-Informant Study,2018,"s with ADHD may be at increased risk to engage in physical  abuse and, in turn, influence the developing  abuse risk of their . The   investigated the connection between maternal ADHD symptoms and their emerging adult 's physical abuse risk, considering potential paths via maternal  abuse risk, maternal  , and the 's ADHD symptoms. The sample included 794 emerging adults and 146 of their mothers. Emerging adults and their mothers both reported on the ADHD symptoms of the mother, the ADHD symptoms of the emerging adult , and the mothers'  . Each  independently reported on their own physical  abuse risk. Models indicate maternal ADHD predicted emerging adult 's abuse risk directly and indirectly through the 's ADHD symptoms but only weakly through   and not through mothers'  abuse risk. Child abuse risk appears related to ADHD symptoms in both generations, reing an area to address clinically to reduce the intergenerational patterns of  abuse risk."
"Single parenting, homeschooling: Prospero, Caliban, Miranda",2008,"This essay explores Prospero's unconventional  of Miranda and Caliban. First, the essay takes up the relationship between  and education and compares Prospero's treatment of Caliban and Miranda in The Tempest. It takes a view of Caliban not only as a colonial subject, but  as Prospero's adopted , servant, pupil, and household slave. While Prospero is successful in bringing up Miranda, he fails in educating Caliban. Prospero's reliance on verbal and physical punishment toward Caliban is disturbing, but Prospero was initially ed as Caliban's loving surrogate father and teacher until Caliban's attempted rape of Miranda, which postcolonial criticism has described as a pretext for seizing and annexing colonial power. The essay takes up the issue of women's education, evidenced in Prospero's unconventional upbringing of Miranda, beyond the postcolonial perspective which has dominated discussions of The Tempest in the past generation. Contrary to Renaissance humanists' advocacy of the same-sex mentor system, Miranda's education lies in the hands of her single father. Despite the period's bias against this  of education, Prospero's unorthodox education produces a very modern and well-balanced human being who turns out to possess not only feminine but  masculine attributes."
The importance of the parent- relationship in understanding physical violence among teenage girls-Results of a mixed-methods study,2014,"This article addresses the question: What is the explanatory power of the theoretical constructs ' ' and '- relationship' for understanding violence among teenage girls? Using a sequential mixed-methods design, we combined data from different sources (interviews and questionnaires) analysed by different methods (grounded theory and correspondence analysis). Within this mixed-methods design, we compared the  of the qualitative analysis of interviews with violence-orientated girls with the  of the correspondence analysis of the cross-sectional survey (n= 243, mean age= 15.2, SD = 1,91). There is a strong relationship between the form of violence applied by the girls and the characteristics of the family dynamics. The utilization of different theoretical constructs (i.e.,   and - relationship) reveals these dynamics and enables theoretical reflection on this subject."
Prem Baby Triple P: a randomised controlled trial of enhanced parenting capacity to improve developmental outcomes in preterm infants,2015,"Background: Very preterm birth (<32 weeks gestation) is associated with motor, cognitive, behavioural and educational problems in  and maternal depression and withdrawal. Early interventions that target  have the greatest potential to create sustained effects on  development and al psychopathology. Triple P (Positive  Program) has shown positive effects on  behaviour and adjustment,  practices and family functioning. Baby Triple P for Preterm infants, has been developed to target s of very preterm infants. This  tests the effectiveness of Baby Triple P for Preterm infants in improving  and /couple outcomes at 24 months corrected age (CA). Methods/Design: Families will be randomised to receive either Baby Triple P for Preterm infants or Care as Usual (CAU). Baby Triple P for Preterm infants involves 4 x 2 hr group sessions at the hospital plus 4 x 30 min telephone consultations soon after transfer (42 weeks C.A.). After discharge participants will be linked to community based Triple P and intervention maintenance up to 24 months C.A. Assessments will be: baseline, post-intervention (6 weeks C.A.), at 12 and 24 months C.A. The primary outcome measure is the Infant Toddler Social & Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) at 24 months C.A. Child behavioural and emotional problems will be coded using the mother-toddler version of the Family Observation Schedule at 24 months C.A. Secondary outcome will be the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID III) cognitive development, language and motor abilities. Proximal targets of  , al self-efficacy, al mental health, al adjustment, -infant attachment, couple relationship satisfaction and couple communication will  be assessed. Our sample size based on the ITSEA, has 80% power, predicted effect size of 0.33 and an 85% retention rate, requires 165 families are required in each group (total sample of 330 families). Discussion: This protocol s the  design, methods and intervention to be analysed in a randomised trial of Baby Triple P for Preterm infants compared to Care as Usual (CAU) for families of very preterm infants. Publications of all outcomes will be published in peer reviewed journals according to CONSORT guidelines."
Supporting Creativity Or Conformity? Influence of Home Environment and Parental Factors on the Value of Children's Creativity Characteristics,2020,"Although creativity is a desirable skill,  for creativity may be quite a challenge and may be less favored than  for conformity. The   aims to investigate -related factors that may support creativity versus conformity at home. To this end, this  examined how s' attitudes and values toward creativity, creative home environment, and mindful   are related to s' perceptions of creative versus socially acceptable characteristics. Analyses of the data collected from 1324 s (predominantly mothers) indicated that s were more supportive of creativity traits than socially acceptable characteristics. Most importantly, s' attitudes and values toward creativity and creative home environment were significantly and positively related to support for creativity characteristics, whereas mindful  was significantly and negatively related to support for socially acceptable characteristics in . Those findings show that s who value creativity and set up a creative environment are more likely to support 's creativity. Mindful   seems to indirectly support creativity because it is associated with lower respect for socially acceptable characteristics, some of which are at odds with creativity. Findings are discussed in terms of the implications for training programs that enhance awareness of creativity."
Social context factors influence basic psychological need satisfaction; a cross-sectional survey among Indonesian adolescents,,"The Basic Psychological Needs Theory posits that satisfaction of basic psychological needs (autonomy, relatedness, competence) is a prerequisite for many positive outcomes, especially the psychological well-being of adolescents. The   tested the three social context factors ( , friendship quality, and school climate) on the satisfaction of basic psychological needs of adolescents and examined which factors are more unique to Indonesian adolescents. In this cross-sectional survey, we included 1500 junior high school students (boys = 717, girls = 783). We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze the data. The current  revealed that  , friendship quality, and school climate all predict the basic psychological needs satisfaction.   and friendship quality are likely to become stronger contributors to better satisfaction of the three basic psychological needs than school climate. This finding was consistent for gender and type of school categories. The current  will contribute to in-depth analysis on designing an effective future intervention program in improving adolescents' psychological needs satisfaction that can improve adolescent's psychological well-being."

"The impact of early parenting bonding on young adults' Internet addiction, through the mediation effects of negative relating to others and sadness",2014,"The aim of the   is the investigation of the potential role of negative relating to others, perceived loneliness, sadness, and anxiety, as mediators of the association between early al bonding and adult Internet Addiction (IA). The factorial structure of the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) and the prevalence rates of it in a Greek sample will  be investigated. A total of 774 participants were recruited from a Technological Education Institute (mean age = 20.2, SD = 2.8) and from high school technical schools (mean age = 19.9, SD = 7.4). The IAT was used to measure the degree of problematic Internet use behaviors; the al Bonding Instrument was used to assess one's recalled  experiences during the first 16 years of life; the shortened Person's Relating to Others Questionnaire was used to assess one's negative (i.e. maladaptive) relating to others (NRO). Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses confirmed the three-factor structure of the IAT. Only 1.0% of the sample was severely addicted to the Internet. The mediated effects of only the NRO and sadness were confirmed. Negative relating to others was found to fully mediate the effect of both the father's optimal  and affectionless control on IA, whereas sadness was found to fully mediate the effect of the mother's optimal  on IA Overall, the  suggest that   has an indirect impact on IA, through the mediating role of negative relating to others or sadness in later life. Both family-based and individual-based prevention and intervention efforts may reduce the incidence of IA. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

A Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluating a Brief Parenting Program With Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders,2014,"Objective: This randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of Primary Care Stepping Stones Triple P, a brief individualized  program, in a sample of s of  with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Method: Sixty-four s of  aged 2-9 years (M = 5.67, SD = 2.14) with an ASD diagnosis participated in the . Eighty-six percent of  were male, and 89% of s identified their 's ethnicity as Australian/White. Families were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 conditions (intervention or care-as-usual) and were assessed at 3 time points (preintervention, postintervention, and 6-month follow-up). s completed a range of questionnaires to assess changes in  behavior (Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory) and  outcomes ( Scale, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21,  Problem Checklist, Relationship Quality Inventory, al Stress Scale) and 30-min home observations of - interactions. Results: Relative to the care-as-usual group, significant short-term improvements were found in the intervention group on -reported  behavior problems, dysfunctional  ,  confidence, and al stress, al conflict, and relationship happiness. No significant intervention effects were found on levels of al depression or anxiety, or on observed  disruptive and  aversive behavior. The effect sizes for significant variables ranged from medium to large. Short-term effects were predominantly maintained at 6-month follow-up, and s reported high levels of goal achievement and satisfaction with the program. Conclusions: The  indicate that a brief low intensity version of Stepping Stones Triple P is an efficacious intervention for s of  with ASD."
Effects of marital conflict on subsequent triadic family interactions and parenting,2000,"This  examined marital conflict's indirect effects on  through disruptions in family alliances and . Forty married couples were observed interacting with their 6-8-year-old sons after pleasant and conflictual discussions. After conflictual discussion, fathers showed lower support/engagement toward sons, and co  were less democratic. Couple negativity was correlated with family negativity, regardless of the topic of discussion, which suggests continuity in the affective quality of the two family subsystems. Mothers' marital satisfaction moderated families' responses to the experimental manipulation. The  provide stronger evidence than previously available of a causal link between conflict and disrupted . Further  is needed to identify which conflict-related disruptions in  influence the development of 's problems."
Family characteristics associated with -to-parent aggressions in adolescents,2014,"The Child-to- Aggression (CPA) is an area of growing interest. Previous studies suggest that a variety of family factors can act as explanatory elements of the CPA, such as exposure to violence, emotional neglect and permissive  . This  examined the association of these factors with the occurrence of severe physical and psychological CPA. A total of 1698 adolescents (870 boys and 828 girls), aged between 12 and 17 years, answered CPA measures, exposure to violence, affection and communication, al abandonment and permissive  . Results of logistic regression analysis showed that low levels of affection and communication were associated with all forms of severe CPA. Witnessing family violence was associated with the physical VFP against fathers whereas direct victimization in family was associated with physical CPA against mothers, and psychological CPA against both s. The permissive  was associated with the severe psychological CPA but not with the physical CPA."
"We Only Teach Them How to Be Together: Parenting, Child Development, and Engagement with Formal Education Among the Nayaka in South India",2022,"Children's school performance is often associated with  practices, implying a direct link between s' behavior,  development, and academic success. Through the case of an Indian forest-dwelling community, I offer an alternative view of  development, learning, and teaching, which prioritizes social skills above-and as a precondition of-academic/practical ones. I discuss the implications of such view to the evaluation of , and more broadly, of formal education for marginalized indigenous communities."
"Associations Among Negative Parenting, Attention Bias to Anger, and Social Anxiety Among Youth",2014,"Theories of affective learning suggest that early experiences contribute to emotional disorders by influencing the development of processing biases for negative emotional stimuli. Although studies have shown that physically abused  preferentially attend to angry faces, it is unclear whether youth exposed to more typical aspects of negative  exhibit the same type of bias. The current studies extend previous  by linking observed negative   (e.g., authoritarian) and behaviors (e.g., criticism and negative affect) to attention bias for angry faces in both a psychiatrically enriched (ages 11-17 years; N = 60) and a general community (ages 9-15 years; N = 75) sample of youth. In addition, the association between observed negative  (e.g., authoritarian  and negative affect) and youth social anxiety was mediated by attention bias for angry faces in the general community sample. Overall, findings provide preliminary support for theories of affective learning and risk for psychopathology among youth."
"Food Heritage: Promoting healthy eating habits from hood, a pedagogical parenting strategy for the prevention of obesity in ",2015,"The act of eating is not just a biological urge, is social too, it is more a matter of habit and learning, a set of behaviors that develop over the years. The family and school environments are a significant influence on the development of eating habits in . Worldwide the number of  (0-5 years) who are overweight or obese has increased from 31 million in 1990 to 44 million in 2012. If the current trend remains, the number of overweight  would increase to 70 million by 2025. The effects of improper construction of food habits on the development of obesity may be avoided by some teaching strategies. The observation and imitation of infant's habits make the people who live with them, vital for nutrition education. As  , consciousness, behavior and amount of knowledge about food and nutrition are essential for promoting healthy life. This paper proposes the development of a manual containing activities to be developed over a period of six months, aimed to , to encourage healthy habits at home with educational tools for people who are caregivers of the ; as a strategy to avoid the growing problem of obesity."
Adolescent mental health and subsequent parenting: a longitudinal birth cohort study,2014,"Background Adolescent mental health problems are associated with a range of adverse outcomes in adulthood but little is known about the effects on adult  practices. This  aimed to examine prospective associations between adolescent conduct and emotional problems and subsequent  behaviours in adulthood. Methods The  sample comprised 1110 members from the MRC National Survey of Health and Development. Prospective data were collected from teacher reports of conduct and emotional problems at age 13 and 15 years and adult outcome measures of  included intellectual environment, cognitive stimulation, coercive discipline, al interest and al aspiration. Results In regression models adjusted for the confounding effects of social background, cognition and education, adolescent conduct problems predicted coercive  behaviours in adulthood. The effects of adolescent emotional problems on the development of coercive discipline practices were explained by covariates. Likewise, the inability of s who displayed conduct problems in adolescence to provide an intellectually stimulating home environment was fully explained by the adjustment for education. Conclusions Adolescents who exhibit conduct problems are more likely to develop coercive  of ."
Exploring Children's Creative Self-Efficacy Affected by After-School Program and Parent-Child Relationships,2020,"This  aimed to verify the relationship among 's creative self-efficacy,  , - relationship, and after-school program. Judgmental sampling was used for subject selection from Taiwan. There are 550 valid participants composed of elementary school to junior high school students; their data were put into the statistical process. The multiple regression analysis was applied in this . The survey tool was developed based on literature review and related articles. Research  supported the idea that the after-school program was the most significant variable that affected the student's creative self-efficacy. The punitive discipline and autonomy support of   can affect positive - relationships as well as students' creative self-efficacy. Evidence supported the notion that negative - relationships will not motivate students' creative self-efficacy. Besides, the after-school program plays an important role in the students' creative self-efficacy independently."
Parenting and Child Self-Regulation in Chinese Families: A Multi-Informant Study,2018,"Theory suggests that  affects the development of important psychological and behavioral outcomes. Many studies relate dimensions of   such as demandingness and responsiveness to  outcomes including self-regulation. Few studies, however, relate  to self-regulation using Eastern Asian samples. The   uses the China Family Panel Study (CFPS), a nationally reative Chinese survey, to investigate cross-sectional relations between  factors (responsiveness, behavioral control, and perceived responsibility) and  self-regulation, which was reported by both s and ten-year-old  (N = 485). After controlling for demographics and self-esteem, perceived responsibility and responsiveness related to higher self-regulation in , as reported by s and . s' behavioral control of  was unrelated to self-regulation. Our findings that behavioral control showed nonsignificant relations to self-regulation in Chinese  indicate that  theory developed using western samples may generalize poorly to Chinese and other Eastern Asian populations."
Parental Attachment Insecurity and Parenting Stress: The Mediating Role of Parents' Perceived Impact of Children's Diabetes on the Family,2016,"Introduction: Caring for a  with diabetes is a demanding and potentially stressful task for s. Although secure attachment can be considered a resilience factor that helps an individual to cope with stressful life events, the idea that secure s are better able to cope with a 's chronic health condition, such as diabetes, has rarely been investigated. Therefore, the aim of this  was to investigate whether attachment-related anxiety and avoidance are associated with  stress in s of  and adolescents with diabetes and whether this association is mediated by s' perception of the impact of diabetes on the family and moderated by 's age and duration of diabetes. Method: A sample of 105 s (92.4% mothers) completed self-report measures of attachment,  stress, and perceived impact. Results: Higher levels of attachment avoidance (but not anxiety) were associated with higher levels of  stress through an increased negative perception of the impact of diabetes. Discussion: This  suggests that s with higher levels of avoidance are at higher risk of experiencing greater  stress and perceiving their 's condition as more burdensome."
"Authoritative parenting, parental scaffolding of long-division mathematics, and 's academic competence in fourth grade",2005,"The current  examined the relationships among authoritative , al scaffolding of long-division math problems, and 's academic competence. In a sample of 70 two- middle class families participating in a longitudinal  on the transition to school, authoritative  was assessed globally at the beginning of fourth grade, when the  were 9-10 years old, from a broad sample of laboratory-based - interactions. Microanalytic assessments of  scaffolding were conducted during a long-division task. Teacher reports and  self-reports of the 's competence were obtained at the end of fourth grade. Extending past studies,  showed that mothers' scaffolding behavior early in the fourth grade predicted teachers' reports and 's own reports of the 's academic competence at the end of the year, after controlling for the effects of authoritative  and prior math achievement on those outcome variables. Discussion focuses on the role of scaffolding as a tutoring strategy that may promote academic competence in school-aged . (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Family socialisation and 's school outcomes: An investigation of a parenting model,1996,"The  investigated relationships between the dimensions of a  model and 's school outcomes. Also, a bioecological model was examined which proposes that proximal  processes have the general effect of mediating relationships between distal social contexts and 's outcomes, while advantageous individual characteristics enhance associations between proximal family processes and 's characteristics. Data mere collected from 900 (460 boys, 440 girls) 11 year-old Australian  and their s. The findings suggest that: (a) a  model defined by s' aspirations,  practices, and   has modest to moderate concurrent validity in relation to 's academic achievement and school attitudes, (b) the proximal processes of the  model mediate substantially the relationships between family, social status and 's academic achievement but not the associations between intellectual ability and outcomes; and (c) there are sex-group differences in the nature of the relationships between the dimensions of the  model and 's school outcomes."
Attachment Style and the Association of Spanking and Child Externalizing Behavior,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the longitudinal associations between maternal spanking and  externalizing behavior are moderated by attachment . METHODS: This  used data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (n = 2211), a large cohort sample of low-income urban families. Multiple-group autoregressive cross-lagged models examined the associations between maternal spanking and  externalizing behavior when  were ages 1, 3, and 5. Moderation by attachment  was examined using structural invariance testing. RESULTS: For  with an insecure mother- attachment , spanking at age 1 was associated with externalizing behavior at age 3. However, for  with a secure mother- attachment , the association between maternal spanking at age 1 and  externalizing behavior at age 3 was absent. Attachment  did not moderate the association between maternal spanking at age 3 and externalizing behavior at age 5, suggesting that spanking at age 3 is associated with deleterious outcomes at age 5, regardless of attachment . CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that even in the context of a secure attachment , spanking is associated with adverse outcomes in early hood. Findings support the American Academy of Pediatrics 2018 policy statement, which encourages s to avoid spanking when disciplining . Results suggest that , regardless of attachment , may benefit from policies and services that promote non-violent forms of discipline."
"Sociomoral reasoning, perceptions of own parenting and self-reported delinquency",1996,"This  considers the relationship between moral reasoning, perceptions of  and self-reported delinquency in a sample of undergraduate students. Correlations showed that several aspects of perceived   were related to moral reasoning, and perceived al rejection was related to delinquency. Separate analysis for males and females showed the same pattern. Gender of respondent was the most significant predictor of self-report delinquency scores. For males and females considered apart. perceived al over-protection was related to male self-reported delinquency, and moral reasoning to female self-reported delinquency. The extension of this  to offender groups is seen as the next step in this line of investigation. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd."
Exploring qualities of ethnically diverse parents related to the healthy home environment of toddlers,2021,"s serve as role models and household policy makers for their 's home social environment. Also, s may influence the home physical environment through the provision of resources to support their 's dietary, activity, and sleep behaviors. Understanding the al characteristics related to 's home environment may allow for tailoring obesity interventions to families' needs. This  aimed to explore al qualities (general  ,  feeding practices, and al BMI) related to healthy home food, physical activity, media and sleep environment of toddlers. A total of 50 multi-ethnic s with toddler age  who were enrolled in a randomized pilot  of a wellness program completed the Structure and Control in  Feeding (SCPF) questionnaire and Comprehensive General  Questionnaire (CGPQ). al BMI was calculated using self-reported weight and height data. The Healthy Home Survey, the Home Food Inventory, the Sleep Environment Questionnaire, and items developed for this  were standardized and summed to create home food, physical activity, screen media, and sleep environment scores; high scores reflected healthier environments. To examine the relationships between al qualities and the home environment, Pearson's correlation test was performed. al BMI and overall healthy home environment were inversely associated (r = -0.306; p = 0.032). Structure in general  and al feeding practice were positively correlated with the overall healthy home environment (r = 0.336; p = 0.026) and healthy home food environment (r = 0.415; p = 0.003), respectively. The coercive control general  was inversely related to overall healthy home environment score (r = -0.333; p = 0.022). Based on the findings from this , s who provide clear communication, set consistent rules, avoid pressure to control their 's behavior, and have lower BMI tend to live in a home environment that support 's health behaviors."

Authoritative  was found to be a positive predictor, whilst permissive  was a negative predictor of attachment security. Results provided practical implications for professional counsellors who work with adoptive families and Chinese adoptees. Results  shed light on future  directions."
Parents Working Together: development and feasibility trial of a workplace-based program for parents that incorporates general parenting and health behaviour messages,2016,"Background:  programs integrating general  and health behaviour messaging may be an effective hood obesity prevention strategy. The current  explored workplaces as an alternate setting to deliver  programs. Methods: This  involved two phases. The objective of the first phase was to explore interest in and preferred delivery mode of a workplace program that addresses general  and health behaviours. The objective of the second phase was to adapt and test the feasibility and acceptability of a pre-existing program that has been successfully run in community settings for s in their workplace. To achieve the first objective, we conducted 9 individual or small group qualitative interviews with 11 workplace reatives involved in employee wellness/wellness programming from 8 different organizations across Southwestern Ontario. To achieve the second objective, we adapted a pre-existing program incorporating workplace reatives' suggestions to create s Working Together ( PWT). We then tested the program using a pre/post uncontrolled feasibility trial with 9 employees of a large manufacturing company located in Guelph, Ontario. Results: Results from the qualitative phase showed that a workplace  program that addresses general  and health behaviour messages is of interest to workplaces. Results from the feasibility trial suggest that PWT is feasible and well received by participants; attendance rates were high with 89 % of the participants attending 5 or more sessions and 44 % attending all 7 sessions offered. All participants stated they would recommend the program to co-workers. Just over half of our  participants were male ( 55.6 %), which is a unique finding as the majority of existing  programs engage primarily mothers. Impact evaluation  suggest that changes in 's and s' weight-related behaviours, as well as s' reports of family interfering with work were in the desired direction post-intervention; however, confidence intervals substantially overlapped zero. Contrary to expectations, s  reported an increase in restrictive feeding practices. Conclusion: Our  indicate that a workplace-based program that addresses general  skills and weight-related behaviours may be a feasible way to engage and educate s, including fathers. A full-scale trial is needed to examine the effectiveness of this approach."
Relationships between Parenting Behaviors and Adolescents' Creativity in China: The Mediating Role of Autonomous Motivation,2021,"This  used a two-wave, longitudinal design to examine the relationships between  behaviors (al autonomy support, al behavioral control, and al psychological control) and Chinese adolescents' creativity, and the mechanism underlying the relationships. A total of 258 Chinese adolescents (mean age = 13.35, 48% girls) participated in the  . The  measured the  behaviors received by the participants, their autonomous motivation, and creativity using the  Scale, the Self-Regulatory Style Questionnaire-Academic, and the verbal and figural Divergent Thinking Tests, respectively. Structural equation models revealed that al autonomy support and al behavioral control had positive effects on Chinese adolescents' creativity one year later, whereas the relationship between al psychological control and creativity one year later was not significant. In addition, al autonomy support and al behavioral control contributed to adolescents' creativity through the mediating effect of autonomous motivation. Findings from the   help clarify developmental pathways linking  behaviors to adolescents' creativity in Chinese culture."
"Girls' Rumination and Anxiety Sensitivity: Are They Related After Controlling for Girl, Maternal, and Parenting Factors?",2012,"Rumination and anxiety sensitivity are posited cognitive vulnerabilities in the development and/or maintenance of depression and anxiety and have only been examined separately in youth. We examined the relation between rumination and anxiety sensitivity in girls, after controlling for other girl, maternal, and  factors known to be related to youth depression, anxiety and their cognitive vulnerabilities. A community sample of 125 mother-daughter dyads (girls aged 9-12; 86.4 % Caucasian) independently completed randomly-ordered measures assessing anxiety sensitivity, rumination, depression, anxiety, and rejecting . Data were analyzed using hierarchical linear regression. We found significant and unique relations between girls' rumination and anxiety sensitivity, after controlling for girls' perceptions of maternal depression and rejecting , maternal report of their rejecting , depression, and rumination, and girls' depressive and anxiety symptoms. Girls' perceptions of mothers' depression and rejecting   interacted with (i.e., moderated) girls' rumination predicting anxiety sensitivity (but did not interact with anxiety sensitivity in predicting rumination). The relations between girls' anxiety sensitivity and rumination appear strong, even when controlling other factors that are known to be related to these vulnerabilities. Our  add to recent advances in integrative cognitive vulnerability models, which highlight the importance of examining the interrelations and distinctions among cognitive vulnerabilities. Our  may  have treatment implications. In cognitive-behavioral treatment for youth anxiety and/or depression, anxiety sensitivity and/or rumination may be a relevant outcome variable or treatment target, or if not even targeted each might be examined as a mechanism of change."
Parenting characteristics and adolescent psychological well-being: A longitudinal study in a Chinese context,1999,"In this longitudinal , the relationships between perceived  characteristics and adolescent psychological well-being were examined in a sample of Hong Kong Chinese adolescents (N = 378). The  indicated that global   and specific  behaviors are concurrently related to hopelessness, life satisfaction, self-esteem, purpose in life, and general psychiatric morbidity at Time 1 and Time 2. Longitudinal and prospective analyses (Time 1 predictors of Time 2 criterion variables) suggested that the relations between  characteristics and adolescent psychological well-being are bidirectional in nature. The  indicated that the strengths of association between perceived  characteristics and adolescent psychological well-being are stronger in female than in male adolescents. Relative to maternal  characteristics, paternal  was found to exert a stronger influence on adolescent psychological well-being."
Associations between Mothers' Work-Family Conflict and Children's Psychological Well-being: The Mediating Role of Mothers' Parenting Behavior,2020,"Objectives Work-family conflict (WFC) has severe negative effects on workers' health and well-being. This  examined whether s' WFC  affects the well-being of their . It was analyzed whether, and to what extent, maternal WFC is associated with  emotional and behavioral problems, and whether this association is mediated by mothers' use of harsh  practices. Methods Using data from two waves of the German Family Panel (pairfam) a total of 1781  and their employed mothers were analyzed using mediation modeling with pooled OLS regressions. Results The analyses show that  whose mothers experience higher levels of WFC report higher levels of emotional problems, conduct problems, and hyperactivity. The   indicate that this association is mediated by mothers'  behavior. Conclusions The findings suggest that mothers'  behavior underpins the association between maternal WFC and  behavioral problems: Mothers who experience higher levels of WFC use harsher  practices, which negatively affects their 's well-being."
Individual and contextual parameters associated with adolescents' domain specific self-perceptions,2011,"The   examined the role of adolescents' self-esteem and perceptions of family and classroom contexts on their domain specific self-perceptions. 345 Greek junior high school adolescents aged 14-16 completed measures of domain specific self-perceptions, self-esteem,   and classroom climate. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that both family and classroom contexts predicted students' self-perceptions, after students' demographics, academic achievement and self-esteem were controlled for. However, different patterns emerged in the relationship between family, classroom climate and self-esteem depending on domain specific self-perceptions. Academic self-perceptions (scholastic, mathematics and language competences) were predicted by classroom climate dimensions (order and organization, student involvement, rule clarity), whereas self-perceptions regarding relations with s, close friends and behaviour conduct, were predicted by  . Given the fact that adolescence is a period of fluctuation in self-understanding which renders self-perceptions particularly malleable, the  support the critical role of the social environments where adolescents operate.

First, potential items were generated that were developmentally appropriate and evidence for content validity was provided through the use of focus groups with s and adolescents. We subsequently provide evidence for several aspects of construct validity of measures derived from the Transformational  Questionnaire (TPQ). Data were collected from 857 adolescents (M-age = 14.70 years), who rated the behaviors of their mothers and fathers. The  provided support for a second-order measurement model of transformational . In addition, positive relationships between mothers' and fathers' transformational  behaviors, adolescents' self-regulatory efficacy for physical activity and healthy eating, and life satisfaction were found. The  of this  support the application of transformational leadership theory to  behaviors, as well as the construct validity of measures derived from the TPQ."
Beliefs about Child-Rearing and Development in Spain and Peru. A Comparative Analysis for Adapting Parenting Support Programs,2020,"Migrant families who settle in host cultures may find themselves in situations of vulnerability which hinder the exercise of their al responsibilities. While there are many support programs targeted at these families, they are n ot always sensitive to the acculturation process. This article compares beliefs about -rearing and development in Spain and Peru, with the aim of enabling interventions to be adapted to the cultural characteristics of Peruvian families living in Spain. To this end, 43 Spanish and 39 Peruvian professionals and s participated in a Delphi process, in which they ranked issues corresponding to four topics:  and adolescent needs, functions of the family context, functions of the school context, and the value of hood and adolescence for society. The  revealed many similarities and some differences between the cultural  knowledge of Spanish and Peruvian families. The implications of these  for adapting  support programs to migrant Peruvian families are discussed. Specifically, the article concludes that Peruvian families require special support in two areas: establishing rules and limits for  and al involvement in the school, both of which are key aspects for promoting  practices which are better adapted to the families' new cultural context."
Fathers' authoritative and authoritarian attitudes and paternal involvement in a climate of political violence,2021,"Despite the growing attention to fathers, in both  and practice, fatherhood in the context of political violence has been understudied. As a , knowledge regarding practical intervention is  lacking. The current  examined whether fathers'   were related to their levels of exposure to political violence and whether exposure to political violence moderated the association between the father's   and his al involvement. The  included 293 Israeli fathers who were divided into three groups according to their levels of exposure to political violence: chronic (n = 88); acute (n = 106); and non-exposed (n = 99). Participants filled out questionnaires about their authoritative and authoritarian   and their paternal involvement. The group exposed to chronic threats reported higher levels of the authoritative   than did the group exposed to acute threats. The authoritative   contributed positively to paternal involvement. Acute exposure moderated the association between an authoritative   and paternal involvement. These findings may indicate that the ability to be authoritative is somewhat jeopardized when the father is exposed to an acute security threat. The characteristics of acute exposure contributed to a weaker relationship between an authoritative   and paternal involvement. Implications for family ers and practitioners are discussed."

Computer-mediated parenting education: Digital family service provision,2016,"Computer-mediated family service provision holds the promise of equal efficacy, lower cost, and higher accessibility than traditional  education groups that require s to travel to a service venue, thereby alleviating often-cited pragmatic barriers to participation in  programs. Hence, examinations of which populations are attracted to particular service modalities are a necessary step in building a reliable evidence base. The scant computer-mediated  education literature indicates that online  programs are beneficial to indicated or secondary prevention programs seeking to bolster specific , , or dyadic outcomes; it is reasonable to ask, then, if this service provision mechanism would be equally effective for all s, outside of targeted intervention designs. The current paper describes the provision of computer-mediated  services to a large sample of s (N = 192, 89.6% female, average age 40 years; 27% racial/ethnic minority) with no shared prevention indicator through an employer-based program. Our  questions on service provision and utilization include: Who is served by primary prevention programs like this? Do participants report satisfaction with computer-mediated services commensurate with traditional face-to face services? In addition to significant differences in perceived social support by gender, marital status, and number of  younger than 18 living in the home,  from three measures of  attitudes and behaviors (e.g., discipline , sense of competence, and locus of control), indicate that this sample has some confidence in their general abilities as s, but struggle to feel an internal sense of control over their 's behavior, with the greatest number of s tending towards overreactive discipline. Associations between these indicate a consistent pattern such that dysfunctional  practices tend to co-occur, and s, who do employ dysfunctional strategies feel less competent as s. Participants report high satisfaction with these services, at equal or better rates than reported in the  education literature. This work provides evidence that computer-mediated  services can attract and exceed expectations of participants with clinical and subclinical but moderate  needs, indicating that this service delivery mode has the potential to reach a wide number of individuals ideally situated for prevention services.

Behavioral problems in perinatally HIV-infected young  with early antiretroviral therapy and HIV-exposed uninfected young : prevalence and associated factors,2020,"Although behavioral problems have been observed in  and adolescents with perinatally-acquired HIV infection (PHIV), behavioral information regarding younger PHIV  are scarce. This  aims to identify behavioral problems in PHIV and HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU)  and to evaluate factors associated with such problems. A prospective  of PHIV and HEU young  was conducted. Behavioral problems were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at baseline and 12 months later among  aged 18?60 months old. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the  Styles & Dimensions Questionnaire identified primary caregivers? symptoms of depression and  , respectively, at both visits. Chi-squared analyses were used to compare the prevalence of behavioral problems between groups. Factors associated with behavioral problems were analyzed by logistic regression.

"Parenting Behaviors, Perceptions, and Psychosocial Risk: Impacts on Young Children's Development",2010,"OBJECTIVE: The goal of this  was to assess which  behaviors, perceptions, and risk factors were associated with optimal versus delayed development. METHODS: A total of 382 families from the national Brigance Infant and Toddler Screens standardization and validation  participated. Data sources included  questionnaires,  testing, and examiner observations of - interactions.    was operationalized with the Brigance -Child Interactions Scale, a brief measure of  behaviors and perceptions. RESULTS: Six positive  behaviors and perceptions predicted average to above-average development on the Brigance screens. Conversely, <2 positive  behaviors and negative perceptions of  indicated  performance nearly 2 SDs below the mean on Brigance screens. Psychosocial risk factors associated with fewer positive  behaviors and with negative perceptions included >3  in the home, multiple moves, limited English, and al depression. CONCLUSIONS: A dearth of positive  behaviors plus negative perceptions of , with or without psychosocial risk factors, negatively affect  development, which is ap as early as 6 months of age. The older the  is, the greater the performance gaps are. Language development is particularly at risk when  is problematic.

"Maternal factors related to parenting practices, developmental expectations, and perceptions of  behavior problems",1995," practices of a reative sample of 1,056 urban mothers with very young  were studied via the  Behavior Checklist(Fox, 1994) and the Behavior Screening Questionnaire (Richman & Graham, 1971). Potential determinants of  practices were  addressed, including maternal age, marital status, education level, number of  living at home, and family socioeconomic status. Less positive  practices concerning nurturing and discipline were found among mothers who were younger, had more than one  living at home, were single, had a lower income level, and had lower educational attainment. These mothers  tended to perceive their  as demonstrating more difficult behavior problems. However, the negative influence of some determinants of  practices, such as low income, was found to be moderated by the presence of other determinants, such as more education. The   provide evidence that multiple determinants influence  practices among s of young ."
Associations between maternal and paternal feeding styles of infants in a racially diverse US birth cohort,2020,"Background Maternal feeding  has been associated with hood obesity and has been the target of numerous interventions, but few studies included fathers. Objectives We assessed correlations and associations between maternal and paternal feeding . Methods We examined 202 mothers, fathers, and infants in Nurture, a racially diverse US cohort (2013-2017). Mothers and fathers completed the Infant Feeding Style Questionnaire when infants were 6 and 12 months. We examined unadjusted correlations using Spearman's Rho and adjusted associations using linear regressions. Results All feeding  were significantly correlated. After adjustment, maternal feeding  was associated with paternal feeding  at 6 and 12 months for responsive (ss 0.31; CI 0.18, 0.45;P <= 0.0001 and ss 0.67; CI 0.50, 0.84;P <= 0.0001), restrictive (ss 0.24; CI 0.09, 0.38;P= 0.001 and ss 0.44; CI 0.29, 0.59;P <= 0.0001), pressuring (ss 0.46; CI 0.34, 0.58;P <= 0.0001 and ss 0.51; CI 0.38, 065;P <= 0.0001), indulgent (ss 0.36; CI 0.20, 0.52;P <= 0.0001 and ss 0.57; CI 0.40, 0.73;P <= 0.0001), and laissez-faire (ss 0.39; CI 0.24, 0.55;P <= 0.0001 and ss 0.55; CI 0.37, 0.72;P <= 0.0001). Conclusions Maternal and paternal feeding  were correlated. Associations held after adjustment, suggesting that mothers and fathers are in relative agreement in their reporting."
Maternal rearing styles and loneliness: The moderating role of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism,,"Loneliness is a common problem in adulthood, with deleterious effects on mental health. In the  , we examined whether the effects of maternal rearing  on loneliness are moderated by the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met polymorphism and whether loneliness can further affect mental health as a mediator in 1034 genotyped participants. The  showed that the COMT genotype significantly moderated the relationship between maternal rejection and loneliness; more specifically, Val carriers who perceived higher levels of rejection from their mothers demonstrated higher levels of loneliness. The moderated mediation model revealed that loneliness meditated the indirect effects of maternal rejection on life satisfaction. Specifically, for individuals with the Val/Val genotype, higher rejection from their mothers had a greater influence on their life satisfaction through loneliness. In addition, we found that the effect of COMT Val158Met maternal rejection on loneliness and the effect of maternal rejection on Val/Val adults' life satisfaction via loneliness existed across different age groups. These findings provide a new understanding of the gene- interaction effect on loneliness and its influence on mental health."
"The Food Parenting Inventory: Factor structure, reliability, and validity in a low-income, Latina sample",2019,"Currently, a number of questionnaires exist assessing a wide range of food  practices with young . In 2016, a concept map covering three food  domains-coercive control, al structure, and autonomy support-was published along with a critical review of the literature. Mapping existing food  questionnaires onto these concepts showed that the major focus had been on coercive control. Important aspects of the  process around feeding have been inadvertently omitted-al responsiveness to 's fullness cues, al strategies to encourage  to try new foods, and al practices related to 's portion sizes. To address this, we developed the Food  Inventory (FPI) targeting encouragement of new foods, mealtime structure, and external control. This new questionnaire draws from a variety of sources including the Child Feeding Questionnaire and the Family Rituals Questionnaire. The FPI addresses most of the food  practices outlined in the concept map with the exception of food availability/accessibility, food preparation, and praise. Psychometrics were assessed with a sample of 248 low-income, Latina mothers who completed questionnaires on food  practices, al feeding , and  eating behaviors. Findings suggest good initial evidence for the reliability and validity of the FPI among Latina families with preschoolers. This questionnaire advances the field of food  by targeting neglected constructs that play an important role in the development of  eating behaviors."
Maternal Attachment Style and Responses to Adolescents' Negative Emotions: The Mediating Role of Maternal Emotion Regulation,2014,"SYNOPSIS Objective. Previous  has examined the developmental consequences, particularly in early hood, of s' supportive and unsupportive responses to 's negative emotions. Much less is known about factors that explain why s respond in ways that may support or undermine their 's emotions, and even less is known about how these  processes unfold with adolescents. In the  , ers examined the associations between mothers' attachment  and their distress, harsh, and supportive responses to their adolescents' negative emotions two years later and whether these links were mediated by maternal emotion regulation difficulties. Design. Mothers in a longitudinal  (n = 230) reported on their attachment , difficulties regulating their emotions, and their hypothetical responses to their adolescents' negative emotions, respectively, at consecutive laboratory visits one year apart. Results. Mothers who reported greater attachment-related avoidance and anxiety reported having greater difficulties with emotion regulation one year later. Emotion dysregulation, in turn, predicted more distressed, harsher, and less supportive maternal responses to adolescents' negative emotions the following year. In addition, greater avoidance directly predicted harsher maternal responses two years later. Conclusions. These findings extend previous  by identifying maternal attachment  as a predictor of responses to adolescent distress and by documenting the underlying role of emotion dysregulation in the link between adult attachment  and ."
"The Mediating Effect of Self-Efficacy in the Connections between Strength-Based Parenting, Happiness and Psychological Distress in Teens.",2017,"Preliminary studies of strength-based  (SBP), a  of  that seeks to build strengths knowledge and strengths use in one's , have reported benefits such as higher life satisfaction, subjective wellbeing, and positive emotions together with lower stress in  and teens. Two proximal mediators conveying these effects have been identified: teen's own use of strengths and strength-based coping, along with a small moderating effect of growth mindsets relating to strengths. The current  tests the potential mediating effect of self-efficacy, a sense of agency in life, in the relationship between SBP and mental health (wellbeing and illbeing) in teens. Self efficacy has been linked to wellbeing and strengths processes in past studies and is classed as a basic human need and form of eudaimonic happiness. This  reconfirmed the adaptive benefits of SBP in a large sample of Australian adolescents (N = 11,368; 59% male; M-age = 14.04, SDage = 1.99) sourced from 28 schools. Using structural equation modeling, SBP significantly and directly predicted higher happiness and lower depression, with direct effects falling into the 85th and 95th percentile of meta-analytically derived individual differences effect sizes. In addition, self-efficacy was a significant partial mediator, accounting for 40.0% of the total effect on happiness and 52.7% of the total effect on distress. Self-efficacy was  a full mediator in the case of anxiety, with a strong indirect effect. Results suggest that building strengths in teens can  build self-efficacy, and given the large effect sizes, that SBP is a promising leverage point for increasing teen wellbeing."
PERCEIVED PARENTAL REARING STYLES IN EATING DISORDERS,2019,"The aim of this  was to test a structural model designed to determine how perceived   may, in women with eating disorders (ED), affect their personal development and the emotional disturbances they experience, and  to explore how these  may influence the emergence of behaviors directly related to ED. EMBU, BSQ, EAT-40, EDI-2, BDI, STAI, and BITE were administered to 168 women with some type of ED. The estimated model showed a satisfactory fit. The  show that perceived emotional warmth in the father plays an important role in mitigating perceived rejection by the mother. The analysis  highlights the relevance of personal and emotional variables, particularly low self-esteem, in the development of ED, above and beyond the direct influence of al rearing  that are perceived as dysfunctional."
Parenting style and perceptions of 's weight among US Hispanics: a qualitative analysis,2018,"al perceptions of their 's weight status may limit their willingness to participate in or acknowledge the importance of early interventions to prevent hood obesity. This  aimed to examine potential differences in Hispanic mothers' and fathers' perceptions of hood obesity, life behaviors and communication preferences to inform the development of culturally appropriate hood obesity interventions. A qualitative  using focus groups was conducted. Groups (one for mothers and one for fathers) were composed of Hispanic s (n = 12) with at least one girl and one boy (<= 10 years old) who were patients at a pediatric clinic in Tennessee, USA. Thirteen major themes clustered into four categories were observed: (i) perceptions of hood obesity/'s weight; (ii)  strategies related to 's dietary behaviors/physical activity; (iii) perceptions of what s can do to prevent hood obesity and (iv) al suggestions for partnering with  care providers to address hood obesity. Mothers appeared to be more concerned than fathers about their 's weight. Fathers expressed more concern about the girls' weight than boys'. Mothers were more likely than fathers to congratulate their  more often for healthy eating and physical activity. s collectively expressed a desire for  care providers (e.g. caregivers, teachers, medical professionals and food assistance programs coordinators) to have a caring attitude about their , which might in turn serve as a motivating factor in talking about their 's weight. al perceptions of their 's weight and healthy life choices are of potential public health importance since they could affect al participation in preventive interventions."

Association between sleep duration and overweight: the importance of parenting,2012,"OBJECTIVE: Sleep duration has been related to overweight in , but determinants of sleep duration are unclear. The aims were to investigate the association between sleep duration and hood overweight adjusted for family characteristics and unhealthy behaviours, to explore determinants of sleep duration and to determine with sleep competing activities. METHOD: A cross-sectional  was carried out in 2006 among 4072  aged 4-13 years in the city of Zwolle, The Netherlands. In these , data were available on measured height, weight and waist circumference, and from a al questionnaire, on socio-demographic characteristics, 's sleep duration, nutrition, physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Associations were studied in 2011 using logistic and linear regression analyses, adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: Short sleep duration was associated with overweight for 4-8-year-old boys (odds ratio (OR): 3.10; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15-8.40), 9-13-year-old boys (OR: 4.96; 95% CI: 1.35-18.16) and 9-13-year-old girls (OR: 4.86; 95% CI: 1.59-14.88). Among 4-8-year-old girls no statistically significant association was found. Determinants for short sleep duration were viewing television during a meal, permission to have candy without asking, not being active with their caregiver and a late bedtime. For all , short sleep duration was strongly associated with more television viewing and computer use. CONCLUSIONS: Association between sleep duration and overweight is not explained by socio-demographic variables, drinking sugared drinks and eating snacks. s have a key role in stimulating optimal sleep duration. Improving  skills and knowledge to offer  more structure, and possibly with that, increase sleeping hours, may be promising in prevention of overweight."

Results: There was negative correlations between secure attachment  and prosocial behavior, emotional symptoms, hyperactivity/inattention, peer relationship problems, conduct problems, total difficulties scores, whereas there was a positive correlation between fearful attachment  and emotional symptoms, total difficulties scores. Significant positive correlations have been found between dismissed attachment  and emotional symptoms, hyperactivity/inattention, prosocial behavior, total difficulties scores. Also there was a significant positive correlation between fearful attachment  and oppression and discipline subscales of The al Attitude Research Instrument scale and a negative correlation between dismissed attachment  and overeager mother, egalitarianism and democratic attitude subscales. Discussion: The implementation of therapeutic, structured mental support program to adolescences with attachment problems and their families could be beneficial im improving mental status of these individuals."
Staff interactive style during multisensory storytelling with persons with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities,2012,"Background Multisensory storytelling (MSST) is an individualised activity for people with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD) in which a story is being told with an emphasis on sensory experiences and social interaction. MSST is a promising approach, but needs more empirical  evidence. In general, there is a lack of  about staff interaction during specific activities with people with PIMD. In the  , we explored the possibility to describe staff interactive  during MSST making use of a global coding instrument. and a professional caregiver participated in an observation . The caregivers received training in MSST and told a multisensory story to their client once a week, for a period of 10 weeks. The first, fifth and last session were recorded on video. Staff interactive  was coded using an adapted version of the Maternal Behavior Rating Scale, with a consensus rating procedure. Results Professional caregivers scored moderately on the Maternal Behavior Rating Scale. Repeated measures analyses showed no change in time. We did not find a relationship between staff interactive  and client or staff characteristics. Conclusions The Maternal Behavior Rating Scale contributes to our understanding of staff interactive  during activities with people with PIMD. Specifically for MSST, the moderate scores on the interactive  dimensions were unexpected, because the individualised MSST activity created an optimal situation for high-quality interaction with people with PIMD. Because the interactive  did not improve through the repetition of the activity either, these  might point to a need for staff training in achieving high- quality interaction during activities like MSST."
Comparison of Family Power Structure and Identity Style Between Delinquent and Non-Delinquent Juveniles,2015,"Background: Adolescence denotes a time in which youth begins to experience dangerous behaviors like substance use and delinquency Objectives: In this  we investigated the family power structure and identity  in delinquent and non-delinquent juveniles residing in Tehran, Iran. Materials and Methods:To accomplish the goal of the  80 adolescent delinquents of the correction and rehabilitation centers aged between 15 and 18 years were selected with convenience sampling method and 80 students of secondary school age between is and 18 years in Tehran, Iran in 2012. They answered the instrument of family power structure (Saidian, 2004)and identity  (151-6G: White etal.1998). The obtained data were analyzed using the independent t-test, chi-square test, and Levene's test. Results: The findings indicated a significant difference between delinquent and non-delinquent juveniles with regard to family power structure, its subscales (P< 0.001), and identity  (P< 0.001). Moreover, the informational identity  was associated with lower levels of delinquency. In addition, a diffuse-evident identity  was related to the delinquency. Conclusions: These  emphasize that the inappropriate decision-making process pattern in a family has a significant effect on deviant behavior and identity  in adolescents. So, family power structure can be considered in therapeutic interventions (prevention and treatment) for adolescent delinquency"
Correlates of Gender Dysphoria in Taiwanese University Students,2010,"There have been no published reports regarding the epidemiological and psychiatric features of gender dysphoria in non-clinical young adults. The current  aimed to investigate the demographics, co-occurring psychiatric symptoms, and perceived   and family support in Taiwanese young adults with gender dysphoria. The sample consisted of 5010 university freshmen (male, 51.6%) with a mean age of 19.6 years (SD = 2.7) from a national university in Taiwan. The questionnaires used for this university-based survey included the Adult Self Report Inventory-4 for psychopathology (including gender dysphoria), the al Bonding Instrument for  , and the Family APGAR for perceived family support. Results showed that gender dysphoria was more prevalent in females (7.3%) than males (1.9%). Young adults with gender dysphoria were more likely to meet a wide but specific range of co-occurring psychiatric symptoms. The most significantly associated symptoms for males were agoraphobia, hypochondriasis, manic episode, and pathological gambling, and for females dissociative disorder, hypochondriasis, and body dysmorphic disorder. Both males and females with gender dysphoria perceived significantly less support from their families and less affection/care from both s. Findings suggest that gender dysphoria, associated with a specific range of psychopathology and family/ dissatisfaction (with both similar and dissimilar patterns between sexes), is not uncommon in Taiwanese university students, particularly in females. This implies the importance of attention and specific measures to offset psychiatric conditions and to promote mental well-being of this population."
A longitudinal study of self-control at the transition to secondary school: Considering the role of pubertal status and parenting,2016,"Higher self-control in  and adolescents is associated with a range of positive outcomes in adulthood. However, little is known about the naturalistic development of self-control during early adolescence and the factors that affect this. We examined the role of puberty and   as theoretically important influences on stability and change in self-control. A longitudinal (3 waves), multiple-informant dataset of  entering early adolescence (M = 11 years) was used to explore longitudinal change in self-control using latent growth curve modelling. Children's self-control declined during the one-year  period and declines were associated with 's behavioural and social functioning. Associations with self-control were found for pubertal status and al warmth and hostility, but not for al discipline. The findings suggest that during early adolescence, when  make the transition to secondary school, self-control declines. This is particularly the case for those experiencing puberty earlier than their peers.  warmth influences the trajectory of self-control during this period.

Children's Dysregulated Representations Mediate Ineffective Parenting Practices and Effortful Control in a Lower Income Families,2020,"Objective Rooted in attachment theory, we tested the degree to which 's dysregulated reations mediate linkages between ineffective  and 's effortful control in a sample of lower income families. Background Children in lower income households are at greater risk for difficulties with effortful control. Although ineffective  practices may influence 's development of effortful control, there is limited knowledge related to the mechanisms underlying this association. According to attachment theory, it is possible that  who experience ineffective  practices have more dysregulated reations, which may then be linked with poorly regulated behavior. Method This cross-sectional  included 40 preschool-age  enrolled in Head Start and their mothers. Ineffective  practices were operationalized using mothers' self-reported   and observed  behaviors; 's dysregulated reations and effortful control were measured during a series of observed laboratory tasks. Structural equation modeling was used to test pathways between measured variables. Results The relation between ineffective  practices and 's effortful control was not directly related; however, structural equation modeling indicated a significant indirect effect through 's dysregulated reations. Children whose mothers were more ineffective in their  had more dysregulated reations. In turn, more dysregulated reations were related to poorer effortful control. Conclusion Children who experience ineffective  practices may be less likely to internalize reliable expectations regarding their environment's structure and order. Poorly stabilized perceptions may inhibit adaptive social and behavioral functioning. Implications These findings inform intervention efforts aimed toward enhancing  practices to improve 's reations and effortful control behaviors."
Integrating a family-focused approach into  obesity prevention: Rationale and design for the My Parenting SOS study randomized control trial,2011,"Background: More than 20% of US  ages 2-5 yrs are classified as overweight or obese. s greatly influence the behaviors their  adopt, including those which impact weight (e. g., diet and physical activity). Unfortunately, s often fail to recognize the risk for excess weight gain in young , and may not be motivated to modify behavior. Research is needed to explore intervention strategies that engage families with young  and motivate s to adopt behaviors that will foster healthy weight development. Methods: This  tests the efficacy of the 35-week My  SOS intervention. The intervention consists of 12 sessions: initial sessions focus on general  skills (stress management, effective  ,  behavior management, co, and time management) and later sessions apply these skills to promote healthier eating and physical activity habits. The primary outcome is change in  percent body fat. Secondary measures assess  and  dietary intake (three 24-hr recalls) and physical activity (accelerometry), general   and practices, nutrition-and activity-related  practices, and  motivation to adopt healthier practices. Discussion: Testing of these new approaches contributes to our understanding of how general and weight-specific  practices influence  weight, and whether or not they can be changed to promote healthy weight trajectories."
Development and preliminary validation of the Adolescent Food Parenting Questionnaire: Parent and adolescent version,2021,"Suitable instruments for measuring Food  Practices (FPP) among adolescents and their s that  measure the perception of adolescents about their 's FPP are rare. The current  describes the development and preliminary testing of a short 16-item Adolescent Food  Questionnaire (AFPQ) for s (AFPQ-p) and adolescents (AFPQ-a) that may enable future large-scale  on potentially eminent - FPP discrepancy. Participants included 381 s (73.8 % mothers; M-age 45.9, 26.2% fathers; M-age 49.1) and their adolescent  (aged 12-16) who participated in the Dutch G(F)OOD together . Most s finished higher professional education (mothers: 44.3 %; fathers: 34.4 %) and performed a paid job of 32 h per week or more (mothers: 22.1 %; fathers: 60.0 %). The theoretical framework of Vaughn (2016) was leading in the development of the AFPQ. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed on a random split sample of -adolescent dyads and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed on the other half. The EFA in both  and adolescent samples ed in a clear 5 factor solution explaining 61.6 % (AFPQ-p) and 64.2 % (AFPQ-a) of the variance respectively, reing the factors Autonomy Support (alpha = 0.79/.82), Coercive Control (alpha = 0.85/.83), Snack Structure (alpha = 0.79/75), Healthy Structure (alpha = 0.78/74) and Modelling (alpha = 0.69/85). CFA confirmed good model fit for the AFPQ-p and the AFPQ-a. Associations with adolescent self-reported food intake were in the expected direction, confirming the preliminary convergent validity of the instrument among a moderate to highly educated group of -adolescent dyads. Although the AFPQ provides a promising short instrument, future  in more diverse samples is needed to build evidence on the instrument's psychometric characteristics in other groups."
Prediction of Children's Attachment Regarding Maternal Rearing Style and Family Type,2013,"This  aims to identify predictive factors of 's secure attachment. The  was conducted in a community-based sample of 288 mothers of school-aged  distributed in three groups accordingly to their family type (nuclear, single- and reconstituted family). The mothers assessed their own rearing  (EMBU-P) as well as their 's attachment behaviors (PCV-M). The  showed a positive correlation between mothers' perception of emotional support and the quality of their 's attachment behaviors, and a negative correlation between the latter variable and maternal rejection. The predictive model of attachment security identified maternal rejection and emotional support as predictors, whilst family type showed no predictive power."
"Adolescent Health, Stress and Life Satisfaction: The Paradox of Indulgent Parenting",2012,"A survey of adolescents aged 15 to 16?years was used to examine the relationship between their perceptions of indulgent  and adolescent weight status to overall satisfaction with life, as associated with adolescent perceptions of body image, health and stress. In addition, perceptions of al indulgence were examined in terms of their association with adolescent eating behaviours and health. The  revealed a paradox related to indulgent , with both positive and negative outcomes for adolescents. Structural equation analyses showed that al indulgence was not only related to lower stress and higher life satisfaction, but  to unhealthy eating behaviours. Path analysis indicated that both positive and negative eating outcomes for adolescents were related to al indulgence. This  has many implications for both  and adolescent health education, focusing on  , stress and healthy life. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
Dissecting maternal care: Patterns of maternal parenting in a prospective cohort study,2019,"al care has a strong impact on neurodevelopment and mental health in the offspring. Although numerous animal studies have revealed that the al brain is a highly complex system involving many brain structures and neuroendocrine systems, human maternal  as a multidimensional construct with cognitive, emotional, and behavioural components has not been characterised comprehensively. This unique multi-method analysis aimed to examine patterns of self-reported and observed  from 6 to 60 months postpartum in a cohort of 496 mothers (mean maternal age = 32 years). Self-report questionnaires assessed motivational components of mothering,  stress, -related mood, maternal investment, maternal  , mother- relationship satisfaction, and mother- bonding at multiple time points. Observed  variables included the Ainsworth Sensitivity Scales at 6 and 18 months, the Behavioral Evaluation Strategies Taxonomies at 6 months, an Etch-A-Sketch cooperation task at 48 months, and the -Child Early Relationship Assessment at 60 months. To examine whether different latent constructs underlie these measures of maternal , we conducted an exploratory factor analysis. Self-report measures of  correlated only weakly with behavioural observations. Factor analysis on a subsample (n = 197) revealed four latent factors that each explained from 7% to 11% of the variance in the data (32% total variance explained). Based on the loadings of the instruments, the factors were interpreted as: Supportive , Self-Enjoyment , Overwhelmed , and Affectionate . These factor scores showed specific associations with maternal education and depressive symptoms, as well as with  outcomes, including maternally reported internalising and externalising behavioural problems, school readiness, and -reported symptoms of mental health. These findings parallel the complexity of the al brain, suggesting that maternal  consists of multiple components, each of which is associated with different maternal characteristics and  outcomes."
Observed and self-reported assessments of caregivers' feeding styles: Variable- and person-centered approaches for examining relationships with 's eating behaviors,2018,"Background: Demandingness and responsiveness are dimensions used in general  as well as the feeding literature to measure  attitudes and behaviors. These dimensions can be treated as continuous variables (variable-centered) or used to form groups of s based on scores on each dimension (person-centered). Research focusing on these dimensions in the feeding domain has relied exclusively on maternal self-reports; observational studies of feeding  have yet to be conducted. Objectives: The purpose of this  was to investigate the effectiveness of variable-centered versus person centered analyses in examining relationships between maternal feeding ,  eating behaviors, and  weight status using both self-reported and observational methods for assessing al feeding . Methods: Participants included 137 low-income Head Start mothers and their preschoolers. Mothers completed the Caregiver's Feeding Styles Questionnaire and the Children's Eating Behavior Questionnaire. / interactions were observed during dinner meals at home and were coded using a previously developed coding system. Results: Maternal demandingness during feeding was negatively associated with  BMI z-scores and positively associated with slowness in eating and satiety responsiveness. Maternal responsiveness was associated positively with enjoyment of food and associated negatively with food fussiness. Significant demandingness by responsiveness interactions showed that  of authoritarian mothers showed the highest levels of food fussiness and the lowest enjoyment of food. Overall, the findings were stronger for the self-report than for the observational measures and the variable-centered approach was clearly superior to the person-centered approach. Conclusions: The current  indicate that for  purposes the variable-centered approach may be the most powerful for examining relationships between maternal feeding and  eating. However, for clinical purposes, the person-centered approach might be most informative."
PARENTAL REARING STYLE - EXAMINING FOR LINKS WITH PERSONALITY VULNERABILITY FACTORS FOR DEPRESSION,1993,"Recent  provides evidence of links between anomalous  experiences in hood and subsequent depression. A  was designed to pursue the possibility that anomalous  effects a diathesis to depression by inducing a vulnerable cognitive  rather than by disposing directly to depression. Possible mediating personality  variables were explored in a  of 123 depressed subjects who scored their s on the al Bonding Instrument (PBI), as well as completing a state depression and several relevant personality measures. Low self-esteem and a related dysfunctional cognitive  were the personality variables most clearly linked with PBI scores, with links persisting after partialling out state levels of depression. Failure to find links between PBI scores and depression levels limited explication of the diathesis stress model."
Perceptions of parental styles and Eysenckian psychoticism in youth: A prospective analysis,2006,"Using data from the Wollongong Youth Study, we assessed the extent to which perceptions of al  predict levels of Eysenckian psychoticism in adolescence. Participants were 660 high school students (males = 322; females = 332; 6 did not indicate gender) who were tracked for 12 months. The modal age of the respondents was 12 years at Time 1. In addition to the psychoticism scale (Corulla, 1990), participants  rated both s on permissiveness, authoritativeness, and authoritarianism. Structural equation modeling revealed that only one  , authoritativeness, significantly predicted psychoticism at Time 2, while controlling for Time 1 psychoticism. Gender differences were  observed.

Perceived Stress and Coping Styles among Malay Caregivers of Children with Learning Disabilities in Kelantan,2017,"Background: Caregivers of  with learning disabilities have been shown to experience increased stress and greater negative caregiving consequences than those with typically developing . There remains a lack of studies focusing on stress and coping mechanisms among caregivers of a wider age group and diagnosis of individuals with disabilities in Asian countries. The current  examines levels of perceived stress and associated  and caregiver factors among caregivers of  with learning disabilities in the Malaysian context. An additional aim was to determine whether caregiver coping  may be predictors of perceived stress. Methods: The Malay version of the Perceived Stress Scale with 10 items and the Brief COPE Scale were administered to a sample of 190 Malay caregivers of  with learning disabilities registered with community-based rehabilitation centres in Kelantan, a state in Peninsular Malaysia. Multiple linear regression analysis was applied to determine the predictors of perceived stress. Results: The mean total perceived stress score of caregivers was 16.96 (SD = 4.66). The most frequently used coping  found among caregivers included religion, acceptance and positive reframing, while substance use and behavioural disengagement were least frequently used. Higher perceived stress was significantly predicted among caregivers with fewer , frequent use of instrumental support and behavioural disengagement coping, and lack of emotional support and religious coping. Conclusion: Findings indicate that the perceived stress levels among caregivers were significantly predicted by different coping . It is vital to help the caregivers improve their good coping  in order to reduce their stress levels."
Parental Phubbing and Children's Social Withdrawal and Aggression: A Moderated Mediation Model of Parenting Behaviors and Parents' Gender,,"The   sought to examine whether al phubbing was significantly related to 's social withdrawal and aggression, and determine whether positive and negative  behaviors mediated this association. We further examined whether s' gender moderated the direct and indirect relationships between al phubbing and 's social withdrawal and aggression. The participants included 465 Chinese fathers and mothers from different families, and each father or mother had one  from preschool and early school aged 4-10 years. They completed the measures regarding their experience with al phubbing, positive and negative  behaviors, and 's social withdrawal and aggression. Results showed that al phubbing was positively related to 's social withdrawal and aggression. Positive and negative  behaviors significantly mediated the associations between al phubbing and 's social withdrawal and aggression. Furthermore, s' gender moderated the relationships between al phubbing and 's social withdrawal and aggression. Specifically, in the mediating model of positive  behavior, the pathways from al phubbing to 's social withdrawal and al phubbing to 's aggression were significantly different. In the mediating model of negative behavior, the pathway from negative  behavior to 's social withdrawal was significantly different."
PARENTING STYLES AND SUBSTANCE USE DURING CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE,1988,
THE RELATION OF PARENTING STYLE TO ADOLESCENT SCHOOL PERFORMANCE,1987,
Perceived parenting styles and disordered personality traits in adolescent and adult students and in personality disorder patients,2007,"To examine the relationship between perceptions of  and personality, the al Bonding Instrument (PBI; Parker, Tupling, & Brown, 1979) and the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology - Basic Questionnaire (DAPP; Livesley & Jackson, in press) were administered to 167 adolescent and 422 adult students, as well as to 198 patients with personality disorders. Principal component analysis of the PBI yielded 3 factors in all three samples: Care, Freedom Control, and Autonomy Denial. Chinese personality disorder patients perceived less al Care than did adolescent and adult students, more paternal Freedom Control than did adults, and more paternal Autonomy Denial than did adolescents. Most regression coefficients between PBI and DAPP scales were moderate, but consistent with previous literature. These findings are similar to those found in the non-Chinese samples, suggesting that al bonding is important in the development of personality disorders across different nations."
The roles of temperamental dispositions and perceived parenting behaviours in the use of two emotion regulation strategies in late hood,2010,"In recent years, emotion regulation has re-emerged in the literature as a fundamental component of psychological functioning. The   investigated the independent and interactive roles of temperamental dispositions and perceptions of  behaviors in the use of emotion regulation (ER) strategies in late hood. A sample of 293  (grades 4-6) completed measures of ER, temperament, and  behaviors. As hypothesized, higher scores on temperament-based Approach and perceived al Care were associated with greater use of the ER strategy of Reappraisal, whereas lower levels of temperament-based Flexibility, Positive Mood Quality and perceived al Care were associated with greater use of the ER strategy of Suppression. Results suggest that despite differing temperamental dispositions, the presence of a nurturing and supportive caregiving environment is important for the development of adaptive patterns of ER.

Predicting parenting behaviors from Antisocial Practices content scale scores of the MMPI-2 administered during pregnancy,2000,"This article examines the relation between scores on the Antisocial practices (ASP) content scale of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2; Butcher. Dahlstrom, Graham, Tellegen, & Kaemmer, 1989) and  behaviors in a sample of low-income women. during pregnancy, 141 women were administered the MMPI-2 and then placed into 1 of 3 groups: an antisocial, nonclinical, or clinical control group. When their  were 13 and 24 months old, antisocial mothers were observed to be less understanding and more hostile and harsh in their   than mothers in the other groups. The nonclinical and clinical control groups did not differ on any measures. Other MMPI-2 measures of antisocial behavior were not predictive of harsh  . These findings support the predictive and construct validity of the ASP content scale of the MMPI-2."
Adult attachment style and caregiver attitudes after raising a virtual ,2016,"Avoidance in adults is related to many negative aspects of caregiving and . This was examined in a simulated  experience of 145 students who raised a virtual  from birth to age 19 using the website MyVirtualChild((c)). Avoidance and anxiety within adult relationships were assessed using the Experiences in Close Relationships-Relationship Structures questionnaire before and after this experience, and caregiver attitudes of positive feelings, perceptions of the 's security, and willingness to serve as an attachment figure were assessed after the experience. As predicted, avoidance and anxiety were negatively related to caregiver attitudes, with avoidance accounting for these relations. These  support the negative impact of avoidance on caregiver attitudes, even when the  is raised in Cyberspace."
ADULT ATTACHMENT STYLE AND STRESS AS RISK FACTORS FOR EARLY MATERNAL SENSITIVITY AND NEGATIVITY,2011,"The current  examined the individual and joint effects of self-reported adult attachment , psychological distress, and  stress on maternal caregiving behaviors at 6 and 12 months of  age. We proposed a diathesis-stress model to examine the potential deleterious effects of stress for mothers with insecure adult attachment . Data from 137 mothers were gathered by the longitudinal Durham Child Health and Development Study. Mothers provided self-reports using C. Hazan and P. Shaver's (1987) Adult Attachment Style measure, the Brief Symptom Inventory (L.R. Derogatis & P.M. Spencer, 1982), and the  Stress Inventory (R.R. Abidin, 1995); observations of  data were made from 10-min free-play interactions. Consistently avoidant mothers were less sensitive with their infants than were consistently secure mothers; however, this effect was limited to avoidant mothers who experienced elevated levels of psychological distress. Results suggest that the association between insecure adult attachment  and insensitive  behavior is moderated by concurrent psychosocial stress. Clinical implications for these findings are discussed."
The joint influence of mother and father parenting on  cognitive outcomes at age 5,2007,"Few studies of  have considered the possibility that the association between one 's supportive  and a 's early cognition is moderated by the other 's supportiveness. We test this proposition using a low-income sample of coresident couples. In addition, we cross-classify s within couples according to their  behaviors to test for homogamy. Mothers and fathers were videotaped during separate free-play dyadic interactions with their 2-year-old , and each 's behavior was coded according to six scales. K-means cluster analysis was used to describe each 's pattern of  behaviors. s were then cross-classified within couples by pattern. There was mixed evidence of homogamous   within couples. After s were consolidated into four primary pairings,  in each of these pairings were compared on age 5 math and language scores. Children with two supportive s scored highest, while those with two unsupportive s scored lowest. Among  with one supportive , the sex of that  was inconsequential. There were no significant interactions between maternal and paternal supportiveness on either math or language. Thus, it appears that in this low-income sample the combined effects of maternal and paternal supportiveness are additive. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Does Apolipoprotein e4 Status Moderate the Association of Family Environment with Long-Term Child Functioning following Early Moderate to Severe Traumatic Brain Injury? A Preliminary Study,2016,"Objectives: To examine whether apolipoprotein e4 (APOE) status moderates the association of family environment with  functioning following early traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods: Sixty-five  with moderate to severe TBI and 70  with orthopedic injury (OI) completed assessments 6, 12, 18 months, and 3.5 and 6.8 years post injury. DNA was extracted from saliva samples and genotyped for APOE e4 status. Linear mixed models examined moderating effects of APOE e4 status on associations between two family environment factors ( , home environment) and three  outcomes (executive functioning, behavioral adjustment, adaptive functioning). Results: Children with TBI who were carriers of the e4 allele showed poorer adaptive functioning relative to non-carriers with TBI and  with OI in the context of low authoritarianism. At high levels of authoritarianism, non-carriers with TBI showed the poorest adaptive functioning among groups. There were no main effects or interactions involving APOE and executive functioning or behavioral adjustment. Conclusions:The APOE e4 allele was detrimental for long-term adaptive functioning in the context of positive , whereas in less optimal  contexts, being a non-carrier was detrimental. We provide preliminary evidence for an interaction of APOE e4 status and   in predicting long-term outcomes following early TBI."
Gang Membership and Pathways to Maladaptive Parenting,2014,"A limited amount of  examines the short-term consequences of gang membership. Rarer, though, is the examination of more distal consequences of gang membership. This is unfortunate because it understates the true detrimental effect of gang membership across the life course, as well as the effects it may have on  of former gang members. Using data from the Rochester Youth Development Study, this work investigates the impact of gang membership in adolescence (ages 12-18) on a particularly problematic  of ,  maltreatment. Using discrete time survival analysis, this  finds that gang membership increases the likelihood of  maltreatment and this relationship is mediated by the more proximal outcomes of gang membership during adolescence, precocious transitions to adulthood."

"Parenting values, attitudes, behaviors, and goals of African American mothers from a low-income population in relation to social and societal contexts",1996,"There is broad consensus among family and  development ers that variations in   and practices contribute to individual differences along a range of  outcomes. Although the literature implies a continuum of  ,  on ethnic minority and low-income families has often implied that these groups are homogeneous with respect to  practices and has compared them to standard samples (usually ethnic majority and middle class). In rejecting these assumptions, we examined the diversity of   in a sample of a low-income, African American families served by Head Start. Analyses revealed a range of -rearing beliefs yielding discrete patterns of  that were distinguished in terms of beliefs about desirable  attributes and community-level attributes, and were associated with 's social competence.

Developmental Origins of Rumination in Middle Childhood: The Roles of Early Temperament and Positive Parenting,2018,"Rumination, a thinking  characterized by a repetitive inward focus on negative cognitions, has been linked to internalizing disorders, particularly depression. Moreover,  suggests that rumination may be a cognitive vulnerability that predisposes individuals to psychopathology. Surprisingly little is known, however, about the etiology and development of rumination. The   examined the role of specific components of  temperamental negative emotionality (sadness, fear, anger) and effortful control (inhibition), as well as  behaviors during early hood on the development of rumination in middle hood. Early hood (age 3) temperament and  behaviors were assessed observationally and rumination was self-reported in middle hood (age 9) in a large community sample (N=425; 47.1% female). Two significant interactions emerged. First, temperamental anger interacted with inhibitory control (IC) such that high anger and low IC predicted higher levels of rumination, whereas low anger and low IC predicted lower levels of rumination. Second, IC interacted with  such that  with low IC and positive  had lower levels of rumination. In contrast,  with high IC reported similar levels of rumination regardless of  quality. Overall, these findings highlight the interplay of early IC with temperamental anger and positive  in the development of ruminative tendencies in middle hood."
INFLUENCE OF FAMILY FACTOR ON PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN'S SELF-REGULATED LEARNING,2013,"Purpose - The purpose of this  was to determine the influence of family factors on primary school 's self-regulated learning. Specifically,  , family learning orientation and al involvement in developing self-regulated learning skill were examined. Methodology - Quantitative survey was utilized to achieve the objectives of the . The survey involved 639 Year 4 and 5 pupils from 10 primary schools located in the state of Penang. Cluster sampling technique was used to select the samples for this . The pupils' self-regulated learning skills were measured with the Learning Strategy Scale taken from the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ), while family factor was measured using three instruments namely the al Authority Questionnaire, Family Environment Scale and Perception of s Scales (POPS). Findings - Findings shows that self-regulated learning was positively correlated with al involvement and family learning orientation. The strength of associations was considered moderate. The  implies that primary school pupils' self-regulated learning improves as al participation and orientation towards achievement in the family increases. Self-regulated learning was  found to be significantly correlated with authoritative and authoritarian  . Nevertheless, the associations between the variables were rather weak. Stepwise regression analysis further showed that family factor was a signifi cant predictor of self-regulated learning. As a whole, it explains 30.6% (R2=. 306) of the variance in self-regulated learning Significance - The educational implications of the findings are discussed in this paper. Family involvement,   and family learning environment influence self-regulated learning. Family factor will create the student who can control their learning strategy from young. Research shows that s are aware of the importance of self-regulation of learning since primary school."
What lies beneath: Parenting style and implicit self-esteem,2006,"The current studies extend previous  on self-esteem by examining one of the likely origins of implicit self-esteem. Three studies showed that Young adult  who reported that their s were more nurturing reported higher implicit self-esteem compared with those whose s were less nurturing. Studies 2 and 3 added a measure of overprotectiveness and revealed that  who reported that their s were overprotective  reported lower implicit self-esteem. Moreover, Study 3 revealed that mothers' independent reports of their early interactions with their  were  related to 's level of implicit self-esteem. In all three studies, these findings remained reliable when we controlled statistically for participants' explicit self-esteem. These findings contribute to a growing body of literature validating the construct of implicit self-esteem. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"CHILD MALTREATMENT, SELF REGULATION, AND PARENTING",2010,"Family is a group constituted by individuals linked with ties of kinship and affection, wherein  grow and develop. Caring and educating  are s' duties. However, quite often, family is not the optimum environment for the development of , especially when it creates and maintains attitudes and conflicts that act against the emotional and physical stability of minors. Child abuse occurs frequently within families and it causes short and long term consequences. However, in several victims of  abuse the negative effects never appear; thus, it is assumed that a number of factors protect them against these negative consequences. A protective factor is something that, in relation or in interaction with risk, reduces the likelihood of psychosocial problems. Social support is one of these variables. The aim of this  was to identify the protective function of social support and the effects of dispositional resilience and self-regulatory skills on the intergenerational transmission of  abuse. An inventory with various scales was constructed, assessing demographic variables such as mothers' age and marital status, monthly family income, separate income for each partner, partner's current occupations, mothers' and fathers' education, history of abuse, resilience,  , self-regulation and social support. The data were analysed using structural equation modelling. The ing model confirms a negative relation between lack of self-regulation and resilience, so that the higher the lack of behavioural self-regulation the lower the resilience. In this   abuse history was positively related to negative . Findings are discussed in relation to the developmental system theory."
"Peer conformity as a factor of risk behaviour of the young: structure, sources and implications",2006,"The   deals with peer conformity of adolescents in relation to their family environment and risk behavior. Data from sample of 845 pupils (aged 14 years) from urban areas collected as a part of International SAHA project were analyzed. The Hard to say no scale measuring the level of general peer conformity was split into two factors using factor analysis. The factors reflect the substance abuse and the sexual components of peer conformity. On the basis of factor scores three types of adolescents were identified: the first type with higher conformity in both components; the second type with higher sexual conformity; and the third type with lower conformity in both components. Identified types showed notable differences in  : the first type showed lower levels of warmness, involvement and consistency of . In case of this type, higher percentage of adolescents more frequently smoking, drinking alcohol and using illegal substances was found."
"Perceived Parenting in Adolescence and its Relation with Positive, Normal and Pathological Personality Traits in Adulthood",2020,"Objective: This paper aimed at analyzing the relation between perceived  experienced in adolescence and personality traits - positive, normal and pathological- in adulthood. Materials and methods: A sample consisted of 512 adults from general population with an average age of 40.83 years (SD = 15.05, 49.6% male, 50.4% female) was analyzed. Results: Statistically significant correlations were found mostly with the responsiveness dimension of . It was positively associated with serenity, sprightliness, extraversion and agreeableness, and negatively associated with neuroticism and detachment. Besides, when analyzing  from a categorical approach of  , it was found that those who reported having authoritative or permissive s had higher levels of serenity, sprightliness, extraversion and agreeableness, and lower levels of neuroticism. On the other hand, those who reported having authoritarian or negligent s had higher levels of detachment. Finally, the  has shown that all positive personality traits and normal traits -except neuroticism-were positively associated with the presence of psychological well-being, and all pathological traits and the neuroticism trait were negatively related to the presence of psychological well-being. Conclusions: Perceived  can be placed within environmental factors associated with personality variability, whose role is significant but small."
The Role of Perceived Parental Dimensions and Identification in Late Adolescents' Identity Processing Styles,2011,"The purpose of this  was to examine the extent to which three dimensions of perceived   (responsiveness, regulation, and autonomy), al identification, and interactions between  and identification accounted for variation in the identity processing  identified by Berzonsky (1989, 1990). A sample of 406 undergraduate university students provided retrospective reports about how their s behaved when the students were 15-year-old adolescents living at home. al regulation uniquely predicted informational- scores. al identification was positively associated with normative- scores, but the relationship was conditional. Identification was positively associated with a normative  when s were high responsive or when s provided minimal support for age-appropriate autonomy and volitional freedom. al identification was  positively associated with diffuse-avoidant- scores, but only when s were low on autonomy support.

"Dysfunctional core beliefs, perceived parenting behavior and psychopathology in gender identity disorder: A comparison of male-to-female, female-to-male transsexual and nontranssexual control subjects",2011,"Background: Research into the association between Gender Identity Disorder (GID) and psychological disturbances as well as on its relation with  experiences yielded mixed , with different patterns for Male-to-Female (MF) and Female-to-Male (FM) transsexual subjects. We investigated vulnerability markers of maladjustment and their possible origins in MF and FM transsexuals by examining maladaptive core beliefs and  behaviors thought to be specifically related to them. Methods: Dysfunctional core beliefs,  experiences and psychiatric symptoms were assessed by the Young Schema Questionnaire indexing 19 Early Maladaptive Schemas (EMS), the Young  Inventory and the Symptom Checklist-90-R, respectively, in 30 MF, 17 FM transsexual and 114 control subjects (43 males, 114 females). Results: Subjects with GID demonstrated a level of psychiatric distress comparable to that of controls. They did display elevated scores, however, on multiple EMSs compared to nontranssexual subjects, indicating feelings of isolation, emotional deprivation and an urge to meet others' needs, with MF transsexuals conceptualizing themselves  as more vulnerable and deficient than controls.  experiences of transsexual subjects were characterised by increased maternal dominance, emotional abuse and neglect compared to controls, with males being exposed to a disengaged maternal  and more paternal emotional neglect and criticism. Both MF and FM transsexuals were made felt that in areas of achievement they will inevitably fail. Conclusions: There is no evidence of elevated levels of psychiatric symptoms in GID, but potential predisposing factors, particularly in MF transsexuals, are ; these may originate from the more intense rejection they experience.

Parent & Family Influences on Adopting Healthy Weight-Related Behaviors: Views and Perceptions of Obese African-American Female Adolescents,2015,Our purpose was to evaluate the views of obese African-American (AA) female adolescents concerning  and family factors relating to obesity and a healthy life. Obese AA female adolescents enrolled in a residential healthy life program completed inventories measuring family functioning and perceptions of  . and participated in focus groups to identify themes regarding  and family involvement in healthy lite change. The majority of participants' mothers were scored as inductive/authoritative and fathers were indulgent. Mothers reportedly were seen as more likely to encourage dieting to control weight than fathers. Common themes of the focus groups included a desire for family involvement. identification of family behaviors that were supportive as well as those w hich were perceived as unhelpful. Though generalizability of these  is limited by a homogenous small sample size. our  suggest that obese adolescents seeking weight loss treatment desire significant family involvement in their efforts.
Identifying and predicting food parenting practice profiles among Canadian parents,2021,"Background Food  practices (FPP) can affect 's eating behaviours, yet little is known about how various FPP co-occur. The primary aim was to identify profiles of FPPs use among Canadian s. Secondary aims included examining sociodemographic correlates of FPP profiles and evaluating whether 's eating behaviours differed across FPP profiles. Methods s (n = 799) of 5-12-year-old  completed a validated FPP Item Bank and the Children's Eating Behaviour Questionnaire. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was used to identify distinct FPP profiles. Regression analyses were used to explore associations between FPP profiles, sociodemographic variables (race, sex and education) and 's eating behaviours (emotional overeating, food responsiveness, food fussiness and satiety responsiveness). Results LCA revealed 6 FPP profiles: healthy eating environment, high engagement, reactive, high structure, controlling and low engagement. Relative to their non-White counterparts, White s were more likely to belong in the healthy eating environment, high structure and low engagement profiles. Relative to fathers, mothers were more likely to fall in the healthy eating environment compared to low engagement profile. s with some post-secondary education were more likely to belong in the healthy eating environment, high structure and reactive profiles compared to the controlling profile. Emotional overeating and food responsiveness scores were lowest for healthy eating environment, high structure, low engagement profiles. s in the healthy eating environment profile  reported lower food fussiness scores compared to s in the high engagement, high structure, reactive and controlling profiles. Conclusions Findings suggest that a continuum of 6 FPP profiles may be  among Canadian s, reing s who use either all (high engagement), some (healthy eating environment, reactive, high structure, controlling) or little (low engagement) of the FPP examined. Future longitudinal  should evaluate how various FPP profiles influence the development of 's eating behaviors, dietary intakes and weight status."
Are fathers' and mothers' food parenting practices differentially associated with 's eating behaviors?,2021,"Little is known about how fathers' food  practices (FPP) are linked with 's eating behaviors and whether these associations differ from mothers. This  examined associations between paternal and maternal FPP and eating behaviors among  aged 5-12 years. A sample of 565 s (53% fathers) completed: 1) the FPP item bank, which measured 11 FPP constructs from three domains of  (control, autonomy promotion, and structure) and 2) the Children's Eating Behavior Questionnaire (CEBQ), to assess four constructs (emotional overeating, food responsiveness, satiety responsiveness and food fussiness). Multivariable linear regressions evaluated associations between FPP and CEBQ constructs, and models were run separately for fathers and mothers. Similarities emerged between fathers and mothers: 1) use of restriction for weight practices were positively associated with emotional overeating and food responsiveness; 2) use of practices to accommodate the  around food and use of practices to involve the  were positively and negatively associated, respectively, with food fussiness; and 3) use of practices to accommodate the , or coercive controlling practices, was positively associated with emotional overeating. Differences emerged between fathers and mothers in terms of FPP associated with 's food and satiety responsiveness, with a greater number of fathers' FPP predictive of these behaviors. Although similarities exist between mothers and fathers, these findings suggest that fathers likely exert a unique influence on their 's eating behaviors and stress the need for interventions to account for the role each  plays promoting healthy eating habits."

Method: One hundred and sixteen s with 2-9-year-old  displaying early-onset disruptive behavior difficulties were randomly assigned to either the intervention condition (N = 60) or an internet-use-as-usual control group (N = 56). Results: At post-intervention assessment, s receiving the internet intervention TPOL had significantly better outcomes on measures of problem  behavior, dysfunctional  , s' confidence in their  role, and al anger. At 6-month follow-up assessment intervention gains were generally maintained, and in some cases enhanced. Consumer satisfaction ratings for the program were high.

Paternal versus maternal coping styles with  diagnosis of developmental delay,2013,"s of  with disabilities vary in their reaction to their 's diagnosis. The current  focused on fathers in addition to mothers and examined their resolution and coping  when having  diagnosed with developmental delay (DD). Sixty-five fathers and 71 mothers were interviewed using the reaction to the diagnosis interview (RDI; Pianta & Marvin, 1992a). Results indicated that the majority of s were unresolved with their 's diagnosis, with no differences found between fathers' and mothers' rates of resolution. Furthermore, both s of  that were diagnosed at a later age and s that were less educated tended to be unresolved, as did fathers of a lower socioeconomic status. Older age of both  and mothers was related to maternal lack of resolution. Finally, an in-depth examination revealed significant differences in the manner in which fathers and mothers cope with their 's diagnosis: whereas mothers were more prone to using an emotional coping , fathers tended to use a cognitive coping . The clinical implications of paternal versus maternal coping  are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Unresolved loss in the Adult Attachment Interview: Implications for marital and parenting relationships,2008,"This  examined links between the unresolved loss of a significant person and current functioning in marital and  relationships. Participants were 80 women who had experienced loss, their husbands, and their preschool . Unresolved loss was assessed using the Adult Attachment Interview, and individual, marital, and  adaptation was assessed through videotaped observations and women's self-reports. As predicted, women with unresolved loss displayed less positive emotion and more anxiety and anger with both their husbands and , compared to women who were not unresolved. They  displayed less authoritative and more authoritarian   with their . Yet unresolved women did not report more individual or relationship difficulties, suggesting that direct observations are needed to assess the implications of unresolved loss for family functioning."
"Metabolic Control, Self-care Behaviors, and Parenting in Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes A Correlational Study",2010,"Purpose The purpose of this pilot  was to explore relationships among metabolic control, self-care behaviors, and  in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Methods Twenty-nine adolescents (mean age, 14.1 years) and their s participated. Metabolic control was determined by an average of 4 A1C values taken prior to  enrollment; self-care behaviors were measured with a 12-item self-report questionnaire;   was evaluated using the  Practices Report. Results The mean for A1C values was 8.5%; the mean for overall self-care behaviors was 4.93 (5 = usually). Participants rated themselves highest on the self-care behaviors of giving insulin shots when indicated and adjusting insulin when eating a lot. They ranked themselves lowest on eating a low-fat diet and testing urine for ketones. s tended to be more authoritative in their approaches to  than either authoritarian or permissive. A significant relationship was found between authoritative mothering and adolescent self-care behaviors and metabolic control. Regression analyses controlling for age and length of time with diabetes confirmed the significance of these relationships. Authoritative fathering positively correlated with the self-care behaviors of monitoring blood glucose, taking insulin, and not skipping meals. A relationship was  noted between permissive  by mothers/fathers and poorer metabolic outcomes. However, the permissive  correlations did not remain significant when controlling for age and length of time with diabetes. Conclusions Clinicians may help prevent declining participation in self-care behaviors and metabolic control in adolescents with type I diabetes by working with s, particularly mothers, and encouraging authoritative ."
Influence of mother's educational level on food parenting practices and food habits of young ,2004,"The main purpose of the   is to examine whether differences in mothers' food  practices by educational level could explain differences in food consumption in Flemish preschool . Three hundred and sixteen mothers of  aged 2.5-7 years, completed a self-administered questionnaire. Differences by educational level were found in 's and mothers' consumption frequencies of fruit, vegetables and soft drinks, and in the use of restrictions, verbal praise, negotiation, discouragement of sweets and restraining from negative modelling behaviour. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that mothers' consumption was an independent predictor for all four outcome variables; verbal praise was a significant predictor for 's vegetable consumption, permissiveness for regular consumption of soft drinks and sweets, and, using food as a reward for regular sweet consumption. Differences in 's food consumption by mothers' educational level were completely explained by mother's consumption and other food  practices for fruit and vegetables but not for soft drinks.

DADS TUNING IN TO KIDS: PILOTING A NEW PARENTING PROGRAM TARGETING FATHERS' EMOTION COACHING SKILLS,2014,"This pilot  reports the preliminary evaluation of an emotion socialization  program for fathers of preschool . The program, Dads Tuning in to Kids (DadsTIK), is a specifically modified version of a universal evidence-based prevention program, Tuning in to Kids (Havighurst & Harley, 2007). DadsTIK teaches fathers emotion coaching  skills that have previously been linked to 's social-emotional competence and fewer behavior problems. The 7-session (14 hours total) group program was delivered to 43 fathers who completed pre- and post-program questionnaires assessing their  (emotional , reactions to 's negative emotions, reactive/angry , and  competence) and  outcomes (behavioral functioning). Program retention was excellent; and, post-program, fathers reported increased emotion coaching, decreased emotion dismissing, decreased angry reactivity and improved  efficacy and satisfaction. They  reported reductions in difficult  behaviors. These positive outcomes suggest DadsTIK warrants further investigation."
Which dimension of parenting predicts the change of callous unemotional traits in  with disruptive behavior disorder?,2016,"Objective: Several studies suggested that in addition to -driven factors (i.e., temperamental ),  behavior can, at least in part, influence the maintenance of Callous Unemotional (CU) traits in ; however, more information is needed to distinguish which  (negative  or lack of positive ) predict increased levels of CU traits. The aim of the  treatment  was to examine which components of  are longitudinally associated with levels of CU traits in  with a disruptive behavior disorder diagnosis. Method: The current  examined cross-lagged reciprocal effects models between positive and negative  practices, and the levels of  CU traits over three time points, including both positive and negative dimensions of  in the same model. Participants were 126 Italian  with diagnosis of disruptive behavior disorder (oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder), 113 boys and 13 girls, 110 Caucasian, 48 with conduct disorder, and 78 with oppositional defiant disorder, treated with a multi-component intervention, based on cognitive behavioral principles and practices. Participants were all 9-10 years of age at the beginning of the , and were followed-up until the age of 11-12 years (24 months in total, the first 12 under treatment) using  report (Alabama  Questionnaire and Child Behavior Check List) and  report (Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits) measures. Results: No significant cross-lagged path was found between negative  and CU traits; these two variables were  unrelated when positive  was considered in the same model. In contrast, reciprocal effects between positive  and CU were found: higher levels of positive  predicted lower levels of CU traits. Conclusions: The current findings suggest that the positive dimension of  may need to be targeted in the treatment of DBD  with higher CU traits. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Tobacco use patterns in traditional and shared parenting families: a gender perspective,2010,"Background: Although ers have focused on women's smoking during pregnancy and the postpartum period and the influence of household interactions on their tobacco reduction efforts, little attention has been given to s' efforts to regulate smoking during the -rearing years. The objective of this  was to examine how  young  and gender relations reflected in couple dynamics influence household tobacco use patterns and, specifically, women's tobacco reduction efforts. Methods: As part of a longitudinal, grounded-theory  with 28 couples to examine the place of tobacco in the lives of new s, each  participated in one or two individual, semi-structured interviews during the first three years postpartum. Grounded theory methods and a gender relations framework were used to analyze transcribed data. Results: Two different   that couples adhered to were identified. These   reflected performances of femininities and masculinities, and were associated with particular smoking patterns. Traditional  reinforced by women's alignment with emphasized femininities and men's alignment with hegemonic masculinities placed women with smoking partners at risk for relapse. Women's actions to be supportive partners facilitated couples' continued smoking. In shared  dyads, egalitarian practices tended to support successful transitions to smoke-free homes. Women's ability to exert more influence around family decision making, and the acceptance of new masculine identities associated with fatherhood were influential. In non-smoking dyads where the mother, father, or both reduced or stopped smoking, we observed a subtext of potential conflict in the event either the mother or father relapsed. Conclusions: Decisions about tobacco use are made within relationships and social contexts that vary based on each individual's relationship to tobacco, divisions of domestic labour and care, and other activities that impact tobacco use. Sensitive approaches to tobacco reduction for women and men must be developed building on greater understanding of gender relations and how tobacco use is integrated in spousal and al roles."
"Relationships with parents, spousal reciprocity, and psychological distress in middle-age adults",2006,"Data from 301 middle-age couples were employed to investigate links between their recalled s'   and perceptions of reciprocity with their s, as well as their current perceptions of spousal reciprocity, on their psychological distress. The  extends Baumrind's theory of hood   and Youniss' theory of late adolescents' perceived reciprocity to a developmental model for middle-age psychological distress. Differential effects were found according to the gender of both the offspring and the . There were significant positive findings only if the opposite-sex  was perceived as authoritative, and significant negative findings if the same-sex  was perceived as authoritarian. Regression models indicated mediated, integrated relationships (through maternal and spousal reciprocity) for females, but no mediations were found for males. Significantly more variance in emotional distress was explained by spousal reciprocity than by the  related variables, and for the men than for the women."
"Parents' experiences of being in the Solihull Approach parenting group, 'Understanding Your Child's Behaviour': an interpretative phenomenological analysis",2015,"Background Empirical evidence suggests that the Solihull Approach  group, 'Understanding Your Child's Behaviour' (UYCB), can improve  behaviour and al well-being. However, little is known about s' in-depth experience of participating in the UYCB programme. This  provides an in-depth qualitative evaluation of UYCB, focussing on possible moderating factors and mechanisms of change that may inform programme development. Method Ten s (eight mothers and two fathers), recruited from seven UYCB groups across two locations, were interviewed within 7 weeks of completing the group and again 10?months later. Data were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Results Four themes were identified: 'Two Tiers of Satisfaction', 'Development as a ', 'Improved Self-belief' and 'The Matthew Effect'. In summary, the majority of s were immensely satisfied at both completion and follow-up: they valued an experience of containment and social support and perceived improvement in specific  difficulties, their experience of , their confidence and their coping. Most s appeared to have developed more reflective and empathic  , with self-reported improved behaviour management. Theoretical material was well received, although some struggled with technical language. Positive outcomes appeared to be maintained, even reinforced, at follow-up, and were associated with having few initial  difficulties, perceiving improvement at completion and persevering with the recommendations. Two participants, whose  had the most severe difficulties, perceived deterioration and felt that the group was insufficient for their level of difficulties. Conclusion Through in-depth analysis of al experiences, UYCB appears to achieve its aims and communicate well its theoretical principles, although change may  occur through processes common to other group programmes (e.g. social support). Recommendations, stemming from the experiences of these s, include simplified language, separate groups for s with complex needs, greater emphasis on the importance of perseverance, and additional support for s who appear to be struggling to make changes.

Early adversity and positive parenting: Association with cognitive outcomes in  with autism spectrum disorder,2021,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social communication and repetitive behaviors. Children with ASD are statistically more likely to experience early adversity; however, little is known about the types of early adversity that place these  at risk, the role of  as a protective factor, and how this early life stress impacts cognitive outcomes. We assessed early adversity in 302  (ASD = 98) aged 6-16 years old, using -based report. To identify protective factors, we assessed   using  surveys. Executive functions were assessed in the  using the WISC-V. Children with ASD had an increased incidence of familial stressors compared to the typically developing (TD) group. Positive  was associated with a significant decrease in the incidence of familial adverse events for both  with ASD and TD . Examining the relationship between adversity and cognitive outcomes, in young  (6-11 years) with ASD, environmental stressors were associated with cognitive impairments. Findings suggest  with ASD may be at higher risk for familial adversity than their TD peers. However, all  benefit from positive  , which may mitigate the adverse effects of family-based early life stress."

"Suicidal Ideation, Friendships with Delinquents, Social and Parental Connectedness, and Differential Associations by Sex Findings Among High-Risk Pre/Early Adolescent Population",2011,"Background: The association between suicidal ideation, friendships with delinquents, and social/al connectedness among pre/early adolescents who reside in high-risk communities is poorly understood. Aims: This  examined among high-risk youths: (1) the association between suicidal ideation and having delinquent friends, school connectedness, social support, and different   (i.e., caring only, supervision only, caring with supervision); and, (2) the differential associations by sex. Methods: The associations were assessed among 2,598 pre/early adolescents using logistic regression. The analyses were adjusted for demographic, mental distress, illicit substance use, and peer/date violence victimization factors. The interaction terms determined differences by sex. Results: After adjusting for demographic factors and mental distress, suicidal ideation was positively associated with having delinquent friends; however, after factoring in illicit substance use and violence victimization, this association was negative for males. After adjusting for all factors, suicidal ideation was negatively associated with school connectedness and all  ; however, the association between suicidal ideation and having al caring with supervision was stronger for females. Conclusions: The  suggest the potential benefits of increasing school connectedness and improving - interactions, particularly among females, and the potential benefits of violence and substance-abuse prevention strategies for youths, particularly males, connected with delinquent peers."
ADVERSE PARENTING AND OTHER CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE AS RISK-FACTORS FOR DEPRESSION IN WOMEN AGED 18-44 YEARS,1995,"65 women who had experienced a recent major depressive disorder, and 81 women who had never been depressed, were recruited from a community probability sample. The two groups of women were compared with regard to a number of hood experiences, including  , which was assessed with the al Bonding Instrument (PBI). When all the hood factors were considered simultaneously in a logistic regression analysis, only low maternal care was significantly associated with recent depressive episodes. Low maternal care increased the risk of recent major depression approximate to 4-fold and the estimate of the population attributable risk was 35%. These findings give further weight to the contention that adverse  in hood, particularly a maternal   typified by low care, is a significant risk factor for adult depression."
A Study of Fifth Graders' Mathematics Self-Efficacy and Mathematical Achievement,2012,"This  aimed to assess the effects of fifth-graders' mathematics self-efficacy (MSE) on their mathematical achievement (MA) in school, as well as examine the effects of gender, family socio-economic status (SES), and   on MSE. A student's background sheet and a mathematics self-efficacy instrument were administered to 1,244 fifth-graders for gathering data, along with their mathematical achievement scores in school. Corresponding statistical analyses were applied to the obtained data. The findings showed that fifth-graders' family SES and   were ascertained as critical elements in the development of their mathematics self-efficacy, while gender was not significantly influential but developmentally noticeable. It  revealed that their MSE ratings could effectively predict their MA. Consequently, suggestions derived from findings and discussions were proposed for further improvement of these fifth-graders' MSE and the future ."
Preservation and Modification of Culture in Family Socialization: Development of Parenting Measures for Korean Immigrant Families,2013,"This  aims to describe the family socialization beliefs and practices of Korean immigrant s through testing psychometric properties of several newly developed items and scales to assess the major components of the Korean traditional concept of family socialization, ga-jung-kyo-yuk. These new measures were examined for validity and reliability. The findings show that Korean immigrant s largely preserve their traditional and core  values, while  showing meaningful, yet not very dramatic, signs of adopting new cultural traits. The   suggest that the acculturative process may not be simply bilinear but may generate a new, unique, and blended value and behavior set from the two (or more) cultures involved. Culturally appropriate practice requires not only further validation of existing knowledge with minority groups, but the development of a theoretical framework of family socialization that recognizes the cultural uniqueness of immigrant families."
"Effects of Share the Keys (STK), a comprehensive, behavioral-based training program for parents and new teen drivers in New Jersey",2018,"The New Jersey Graduated Driver License (GDL) restrictions were updated in 2010 with changes that included a more active role of s monitoring practice driving with their teens. In addition to extending the driving phases, there were new curfew and passenger limit restrictions. Teen drivers were  required to use red decals on license plates to identify themselves as inexperienced drivers. The Division of Highway Traffic Safety had partnered with the Motor Vehicle Commission in the past to produce practice driving guides for s of teen drivers, but recognized the need to support this type of informational campaign with an educational program for helping s to understand changes in the GDL and recognize the importance of their role in the GDL monitoring process. In 2010, the New Jersey /Teen Driver Orientation program was developed to educate s of teen drivers on the new GDL restrictions and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) findings concerning the importance of  roles in teen driver safety. Additional resources were incorporated into the orientation that included the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) community based information and the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) -teen driver contracts. This community-based training, known as the New Jersey /Teen Driver Orientation was later renamed Share the Keys, and had been developed for the state as a component of the New Jersey Highway Safety grant received by Kean University. The comprehensive program was designed to engage s, teens, educators, and law enforcement in the teen driving process and help s to understand how personal   and engagement may impact teen crash risk and compliance with the GDL restrictions. Local reatives from traffic safety and law enforcement teamed with school officials and driver education teachers to  programs in their communities. The evaluation process was built into the program as a pre-survey administered at the beginning of the session, a post-survey completed directly afterward, and a voluntary follow-up survey completed on line or mailed, beginning six months later. Evidence from the first year showed that s maintained a significant level of engagement throughout the GDL process with their teen drivers. However, findings did establish the need to further examine why Authoritative   had declined, especially since this  approach was considered in the literature as most effective in reducing teen crash risks. Therefore, the scope of this  was broadened to a three year effort that reached over 2800 s and investigated behavioral outcomes impacted by Share the Keys. While comparisons made between driving phases and   had yielded no significant , changes within   scores were shown to be effective over time. The reported levels of Permissive and Uninvolved s remained consistent throughout all three driving phases, while Authoritarian  peaked during the Probationary phase, and Authoritative  was noted as highest once teens earned their license.

The quality of parenting of individuals who had failed to thrive as ,2002," behaviour is determined by a range of factors including personality, psychopathology, values, social support,  characteristics and socio-cultural influences. It has  been suggested that an individual's  of -rearing is influenced by the  of  that they experienced as . The relationships between  who fail-to-thrive and their s are often characterized by interactional difficulties. Previous  using retrospective accounts suggested that mothers of  who fail-to-thrive for non-organic reasons themselves showed high levels of abuse, neglect, and deprivation during their hoods. However, to date no one has investigated prospectively what kinds of s failure-to-thrive individuals become. This paper examines the  experiences of individuals who had received psychosocial intervention for their non-organic failure-to-thrive as  over 20 years ago, Results suggest that where initial intervention failed to bring about long-term changes in family interactional patterns, there was a greater incidence of failure-to-thrive in the next generation. These families were characterized by dissatisfaction with the , high levels of stress associated with the  role, and low levels of social support, However, where the family environment in the original  had changed substantially, the former clients' outcomes were more positive with their own . These s tended to find interaction with their  more rewarding, had good support networks and low levels of stress. The characteristics of particular cases are discussed in detail to illustrate differences between these two groups of individuals."
Coping styles of pregnant adolescents,2001,"This descriptive  examined the coping  and specific strategies used by a group of pregnant adolescents attending an adolescent family support service. Seventy-one adolescents, with a mean age of 17 years, and a mean gestation of 25 weeks, completed the Revised Jalowiec Coping Scale (JCS-R). The findings demonstrated that the optimistic coping  (emotion-focused) was the most frequently used and most effective coping  for these young women. A confrontive coping  (problem-focused) was  used and found to be effective. A combination of problem-focused and emotion-focused  is recommended, with an increased emphasis on problem-focused approaches. The focus by the adolescents on optimistic approaches is suggestive of a lack of understanding of the challenges that motherhood will place upon them, but is consistent with their age and developmental stage. A longitudinal  of coping  and changes in  throughout pregnancy and early motherhood is recommended. Initial assessment and monitoring of coping  of pregnant adolescents is proposed. This assessment would be the beginning point for a teaching program that highlights increased use of adaptive coping  (problem-focused) with decreased use of maladaptive approaches, and includes emotion-focused . By expanding the repertoire of coping  and strategies available to the adolescent, the public health nurse (PHN) prepares these vulnerable mothers for the challenges ahead."
Is Drinking with Parents Associated with High-Risk Drinking among Adolescents?,2015,"Background/Aims: What are the implications of drinking with s (DWP) on adolescents' drinking behavior? We expanded the meagre body of  on this controversial issue by assessing the association between the frequency of DWP and adolescent high-risk drinking, taking a number of al factors into account. Method: Data stemmed from a subsample of 14-17-year-old current drinkers (n = 7,616) who participated in a cross-sectional Norwegian school survey (response rate: 84%). Results: One in four reported DWP during the past year. The higher the frequency of DWP, the higher was the prevalence of high-risk drinking. al drunkenness, permissive alcohol-related , and indicators of suboptimal  more generally  correlated with DWP. After controlling for these confounders, only frequent DWP remained significantly associated with high-risk drinking. Conclusions: DWP was related to adolescent high-risk drinking, yet the association was in part attributable to s' drinking and  . The risk of involvement in high-risk drinking was about the same for adolescents reporting no DWP and infrequent DWP, while it was significantly elevated among those reporting frequent DWP. This  thus demonstrated that the frequency of DWP matters and that s who drink with their adolescent  differ from other s in important ways. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel"
Maternal Parenting Behaviors during Childhood Relate to Weight Status and Fruit and Vegetable Intake of College Students,2012,"Objective: Examine how maternal  behaviors in hood, both general and feeding specific, relate to weight status and fruit and vegetable consumption in college students. Design: Retrospective surveys on maternal behaviors and assessments on the college-aged 's current anthropometric measures and dietary intakes. Participants: College students ( n = 424; 66% women). Main Outcome Measures: Students' weight, height, waist circumference, fruit and vegetable intakes, students' reports on mothers' general and feeding-specific  behaviors during hood. Analysis: Correlation and regression analyses tested how maternal behaviors in hood related to students' body mass index, waist circumference, and fruit and vegetable intake. Results: Mothers' psychological control during hood was associated with higher body mass index and waist circumference in students, and behavioral control was associated with lower waist circumference. -centered feeding behaviors related to lower fruit and vegetable intakes of students, whereas -centered feeding behaviors related to higher fruit and vegetable intakes. Conclusions and Implications: Findings suggest that al use of behavioral control and -centered feeding practices and minimal use of psychological control and -centered feeding practices during hood may promote a 's healthful weight status and fruit and vegetable consumption in young adulthood, specifically during college."
Challenges experienced by parents living with a  with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,2017,"Objective: The aim of this South African  was to explore s' experiences of living with a  with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Investigating Correlates of Self-Regulation in Early Childhood with a Representative Sample of English-Speaking American Families,2013,"Children who possess less self-regulatory skill are at a disadvantage when compared to  who demonstrate greater skill at regulating their emotions, cognitions and behavior. Children with these regulatory deficits have difficulty connecting with peers, generating relationships with teachers, negotiating their social world, and succeeding academically. By understanding the correlates of self-regulatory abilities, interventions can be developed to ensure that  at-risk for poor self-regulation receive the support necessary to enhance their regulatory skills. Using data from a nationally reative survey of English-speaking American s with  between the ages of two and eight (n = 1,141), we evaluated a host of demographic and  variables to isolate the correlates of self-regulation. Older  were found to have fewer regulatory problems than younger  while  from low-income homes and male  were found to have greater problems with self-regulation. Minority status, household composition (single vs multi-), and al education were not significant correlates of self-regulation. Findings  illustrate the powerful relationship between   and self-regulation. s who rely on nurturing  practices that reinforce the 's sense of autonomy while still maintaining a consistent  presence (i.e., authoritative ) have  who demonstrate stronger self-regulatory skills. s who exert an excess of al control (i.e., authoritarian s) have  with weaker self-regulatory skills. And lastly, s who have notable absence of control (i.e., permissive s) are more likely to have  with considerable regulatory deficits. Results offer implications for both practitioners and scholars."
Discipline behaviors of Chinese American and European American mothers,2006,"In any society,  beliefs are a reflection of that society's cultural values and traditions (J. U. Ogbu, 1981).

"Maternal Control, Cognitive Style, and Childhood Anxiety: A Test of a Theoretical Model in a Multi-Ethnic Sample",2010,"This  tested a theoretical model of the interrelations among controlling , negative cognitive , 's anxiety, and race/ethnicity. The model suggests that, in general, cognitive  mediates the relation between maternal control and  anxiety but that the set of associations may differ as a function of ethnicity. African American (n = 235), Latin American (n = 56), and European American (n = 136)  completed measures of their anxiety, cognitive schemas reflecting impaired autonomy/performance and disconnection/rejection domains, and maternal control. Results indicated that a disconnection/rejection negative cognitive  mediated the effect of perceived maternal control on hood anxiety only for the European American group. Maternal control was associated with the impaired autonomy/performance cognitive  for each of the three ethnic groups and with a disconnection/rejection cognitive  only for the European American and Latin American groups. Maternal control had an indirect effect on anxiety through the disconnection/rejection cognitive  for the Latin American group. The  are discussed in terms of how the model ed extends current theories of anxiety problems to African American and Latin American  by noting that significant cultural variations may exist in how  practices and cognitive  relate to 's anxiety levels."
Lifestyles and Styles of Parental Care Related to Childhood Obesity. Compare Spain with Northern European Countries: ENERGY-Project,2015,"Background: The prevalence of hood obesity is higher in Spain than in Northern European countries for reasons that are still unknown. The objective was to determine whether variables related to life habits and  of al care related to obesity in  differ between the countries of Northern Europe and Spain. Methods: Data were obtained from the ENERGY international project using questionnaires. We analyzed data from Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium and Norway including 1937 boys and 2061 girls aged 10-12 years old. We have studied the behavior of s related to dietary variables, variables related to physical activity and ways of care. We calculated the mean and the proportions of all the variables and then calculated the association between different variables with the country of origin using the beta coefficient and the odds ratio (OR) as a measure of association. Results: Compared with s in Northern Europe, Spanish s consume significantly less days a week sugary drinks (Mean: 1.37 vs 2.16) but they consume more fruit juices (Mean: 2,61 vs 2,35). Spanish s are more active going to their work, they are less sedentary but perform physical activity in their leisure time fewer days per week (Mean days per week they do physical activity in their leisure time: 1.88 vs 2.21). In addition, they are less negotiators with their  (Mean (0-4): 1.26 vs 1.68) and prevent less negative role models (Mean (0-4): 0.90 vs 1.29). However, they pay more attention (Mean (0-4): 3.42 vs 3.04) and encourage more healthy habits (Mean (0-4): 2.38 vs 2.06). Conclusions: The variables related to life habits and  of care related to hood obesity differ between Spanish s and those of the countries of Northern Europe but these differences are not statistically significant. Therefore, differences in life and  practices might not explain the significant differences in hood obesity between the Northern countries and Spain."
SIGNIFICANCE OF TOUCH FOR PERCEPTIONS OF PARENTING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ADJUSTMENT AMONG ADOLESCENTS,1995,"Objective: This pilot  set out to investigate whether a relationship exists between differential quality and quantity of physical contact experience and perceptions of , psychological adjustment, and suicidal behavior among adolescents. Method: A self-report questionnarire assessed individuals' perceptions of how frequently they experienced pleasant (positive) and unpleasant (negative) touch from family and friends. Together with the Achenbach Youth Self-Report and the al Bonding Instrument, this questionnaire were administered to 142 male and 129 female students aged between 13 and 15 years (mean = 13.54, SD = 0.56) attending a randomly chosen metropolitan state high school and a coeducational private school. Results: The major findings indicated that differential quality and quantity of physical contact experience was related to perceptions of , psychological adjustment, and suicidal behavior, although a gender difference was observed. Conclusions: The findings suggest that physical contact experiences may reflect different   and may be a vulnerability factor for a range of difficulties among adolescents."
"Improving Early Relationships: A Randomized, Controlled Trial of an Age-Paced Parenting Newsletter",2009,"OBJECTIVES.  is recognized as a key mediator in both health and educational outcomes. Much is known on the value of support and group work in benefiting , but little is known on the effect of written information. A randomized, controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of a  newsletter, sent monthly to the s' home from birth to 1 year, on maternal well-being and  . We tested the hypothesis that mothers receiving the newsletter would show less stress and better  characteristics than controls. METHODS. s of first infants born in a North East England District General Hospital between February and October 2003 who consented to take part in the  were randomly allocated to either the intervention or control arm. Those in the intervention arm were sent 12 monthly issues of an age-paced  newsletter containing information on emotional development, - interaction, and play. Both the intervention and control group received normal  support. Mothers in both groups completed the Well-being Index,  Daily Hassles Scale, and the Adult-Adolescent  Inventory at birth and at 1 year. RESULTS. One hundred eighty-five mothers were recruited, with 94 randomly assigned to the intervention group, and 91 controls. Allowing for differences at recruitment, there were significant differences between the groups at 1 year: the intervention mothers had lower frequency and intensity of perceived hassles and fewer inappropriate expectations of the infant on the Adult-Adolescent  Inventory than the control mothers. CONCLUSIONS. A monthly  newsletter sent directly to the home in the first year of life seems to help s to understand their infant better and feel less hassled. This intervention is low cost and can be applied to all s, so it is nonstigmatizing. Pediatrics 2009;123:241-247"
Infant temperament moderates relations between maternal parenting in early hood and 's adjustment in first grade,2008,"A differential susceptibility hypothesis proposes that  may differ in the degree to which  qualities affect aspects of  development. Infants with difficult temperaments may be more susceptible to the effects of  than infants with less difficult temperaments. Using latent change curve analyses to analyze data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care, the current  found that temperament moderated associations between maternal   during early hood and 's first-grade academic competence, social skills, and relationships with teachers and peers. Relations between  and first-grade outcomes were stronger for difficult than for less difficult infants. Infants with difficult temperaments had better adjustment than less difficult infants when  quality was high and poorer adjustment when  quality was lower."
Choosing adolescent smokers as friends: The role of parenting and parental smoking,2013,"The   examined whether  and al smoking can prevent  from selecting smoking friends during adolescence. 254 Adolescents of one Belgian secondary school participated. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed among 2nd-4th graders (mean ages = 14.2-16.2 years) during spring 2006. Follow-up was conducted 12 months later. Data was analyzed conducting longitudinal social network analyses. Results showed adolescents perceiving high al psychological control had a significant higher tendency to select smoking friends. Perceived behavioral control and perceived al support did not affect the selection of smoking friends. Furthermore, maternal smoking behavior affected the selection of smoking friends, although no effect of paternal smoking behavior on the selection of smoking friends was found. Adolescent smoking prevention efforts should focus on the influence of s through their smoking behavior and their psychological control to decrease adolescents' tendency to select smoking friends ing in fewer opportunities for negative peer influences to occur.

Parents' Perspectives on Radicalization: A Qualitative Study,2018,"Radicalization of young people might be influenced by the way s react towards the development of political or religious ideals. However, these reactions have hardly been explored. This  aimed to discover how s reacted to the development of extreme ideals, and why they responded in the way that they did. To gain knowledge about the influence of s on adolescents who developed extreme ideals, 82 in-depth interviews were held with adolescents and young adults who held extreme ideals. Interviews were  held with the s or siblings of each adolescent and young adult. In line with   theory, it was found that s react in four possible ways: (1) by rejecting, (2) applauding, (3) ignoring, or (4) discussing the (extreme) ideals of their . Few s discuss ideals and values with their , and this paper tries to show why (e.g., powerlessness, disassociation, occupation with other problems, believing it to be a phase that will pass, or that their reaction would not help). Most s struggle to cope with radicalization and do not know how to react. Support and control are potentially important tools for s to use to combat the development of extreme ideology."
Tuned In Parenting (TIP): A Collaborative Approach to Improving Parent- Relationships,2008,"This paper describes a collaborative partnership between a community early  agency and a university psychology department to develop and deliver an innovative programme for relationship issues in young families. The programme was to be in keeping with the  and practice parameters of the agency. The processes involved in the development, trial and evaluation of the programme are outlined. Known as the Tuned in  (TIP) Programme it aims to promote reflective awareness in mothers and to build sensitive and responsive . Agency staff members conduct a DVD-based intervention in a reflective and collaborative manner with a small group of mothers who engage in discussion around DVDs of their own interactions with their . Qualitative analysis of participant interviews established that mothers perceive the programme as valuable in increasing sensitivity to infant cues and engaged in reflection on their own  of . Parallel processes between organisations, between nurses and their clients, and between mothers and their babies facilitated genuine change on many levels. Theory and practice from this project now underpins service delivery for the agency and review, evaluation, and adjustments are continually made as the agency moves towards best practice."
The role of parental style in the conduct disorders: A comparison between adolescent boys with and without conduct disorder,2014,"Objective: An important contributing factor, but one that has not been investigated thoroughly in South Africa, is the role of al  which has been consistently found to be a precursor of conduct disorder. Method: To establish whether specific al factors that contribute to this disorder in a South African sample, the al Bonding Instrument and the Family Environment Scale were administered to 2 groups of adolescent boys: a group diagnosed with conduct disorder (n = 40) and a group without a diagnosis of conduct disorder (n = 40). To test for significant differences between the two groups, t-tests were performed. Results: A typical   characterised by low care by the mother and overprotection by the father, which forms an affectionless, controlling  , was found in the  in the conduct disorder group. This type of    in high control, low expressiveness of emotions, minimal involvement with , and inadequate supervision and monitoring of .

Association between the Mother's Social Cognition and the Child's Social Functioning in Kindergarten: The Mediating Role of the Child's Social Cognition,2020,"Children's ability to adjust to the social rules and expectations in the educational environment is of major concern to ers and practitioners alike. Accordingly, the main purpose of the   was to examine predictors of 's social functioning in kindergarten with a specific focus on (a) maternal factors and (b) 's social cognition. Using a multi-method (self-reports and direct assessments), multi-informant (, mother, teacher) design, we collected data from 301 kindergarten  and their mothers tapping the mother's social cognition (general and -related) and  , and 's social cognition (social information processing) and functioning in kindergarten. We found direct associations between the mother and 's social cognition, between the mother's authoritarian   and her 's less competent social cognition and behavior, and between the 's social cognition and social functioning. Finally, as hypothesized, we found a number of interesting mediated effects. Most notably, we found that the association between the mother's social cognition (her tendency to attribute hostile intent to unknown others) and the 's social cognition (his/her tendency to generate less competent responses) is fully mediated by the mother's higher levels of authoritarian  . The important theoretical and clinical implications of our findings are discussed."
Psychosocial associations of emotion-regulation strategies in young adults residing in the United Arab Emirates,2019,"The management and expression of emotions can have a positive impact on psychological health and overall functioning. Thus, it is crucial to focus on the  of emotion regulation and the strategies young adults employ to achieve it, namely cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, as well as their associations with the long neglected psychosocial factors. The current  aimed at exploring the associations between psychosocial factors and the two emotion-regulation strategies, after controlling for potential sociodemographic confounders. This  used a sample of 136 participants from the Indian subcontinent living in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, aged 18-25 years, who completed instruments measuring social anxiety, social support, and   (authoritative, authoritarian, permissive) as well as the use of the emotion-regulation strategies of suppression and reappraisal. The  indicated that having experienced authoritarian  and perceiving low social support were associated with the use of suppression, while having experienced authoritative  and low levels of social anxiety were associated with the use of emotional reappraisal. Our  provides evidence on the importance of psychosocial factors for the use of emotion-regulation strategies and suggests their modification for the promotion of adaptive ways of managing emotions."
"Bidirectional associations between activity-related parenting practices, and  physical activity, sedentary screen-based behavior and body mass index: a longitudinal analysis",2017,"Background: It has been generally assumed that activity-related  practices influence 's activity behavior and weight status. However, vice versa s may  change their  behaviors in response to their perceptions of their 's activity behavior and weight status. This  examined the bidirectional relationships between activity-related  practices, and physical activity, sedentary screen-based behavior, and body mass index (BMI) between 's age of 5 and 7 years. Methods: Three scales of the Activity-related  Questionnaire (i.e. 'restriction of sedentary behavior', 'stimulation of physical activity', and 'monitoring of physical activity') were completed by 1694 s of the Dutch KOALA Birth Cohort Study at the 's age of around 5 and again around age 7. Physical activity, sedentary screen-based behavior and BMI were measured at both ages as well. Linear regression models were used to estimate the bidirectional associations between each  practice and the 's physical activity levels, sedentary screen-based behavior and BMI z-scores. Results: Several  practices at age 5 predicted  physical activity, sedentary screen-based behavior, and BMI z-scores at age 7. Restriction of sedentary behavior positively predicted  BMI and sedentary screen-based behavior, whereas this practice negatively predicted  physical activity. In addition, stimulation of physical activity at age 5 was significantly associated with higher levels of  physical activity at age 7. The following  factors at age 5 predicted  practices at age 7: Child physical activity positively predicted al stimulation of physical activity and monitoring activities. Sedentary screen-based behavior was associated with lower al stimulation to be active. Conclusions: Findings generally revealed that s and  mutually influence each other's behavior. A reinforcing feedback loop was  between al stimulation of physical activity and  physical activity. Bidirectional - interaction should be considered in future  in order to properly inform -related intervention programs aimed at preventing or treating hood overweight or obesity. System dynamic methods to explore the existence of reinforcing or balancing loops are needed in this regard."
Developmental Processes Across the First Two Years of Parenthood: Stability and Change in Adult Attachment Style,2018,"The first months after becoming a new  are a unique and important period in human development. Despite substantial  on the many social and biological changes that occur during the first months of hood, little is known about changes in mothers' attachment. The   examines developmental stability and change in first-time mothers' attachment  across the first 2 years of motherhood. At Time 1, 162 economically stressed primiparous mothers (M-age = 23.98 years, SD = 5.18) completed measures of attachment anxiety and avoidance at five time points: when their  were 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of age. Converging  of stability functions and latent growth curve models suggest that attachment  were generally stable during the first 2 years of motherhood, even in this economically stressed sample. Furthermore, model comparisons revealed that a prototype model better characterized the developmental dynamics of mothers' attachment  than did a revisionist model, consistent with previous studies of adults and adolescents. This suggests that a relatively enduring prototype underlies mothers' attachment  and anchors the extent to which mothers experience attachment-related changes following the birth of their first . Within this overall picture of continuity, however, some mothers did show change over time, and specific factors emerged as moderators of attachment stability, including maternal depressive symptoms and overall psychological distress, as well as sensitive care from their own mothers. Findings shed light on patterns of continuity and change in new s' development."
Stress and Coping Styles in Mothers of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder,2020,"Background: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) require well-balanced care and a comprehensive therapeutic approach. Mental health problems often go unnoticed in mothers of  with ASD due to the focus on training for the . The presence of stress and depressive symptoms in mothers can interfere with the quality of care and therapy given to the . The   aimed to assess the quality of life, coping , and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in mothers of  with ASD. Methods: This  recruited thirty mothers of  with ASD, to whom Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS 21), WHO Quality of Life Scale (WHOQOL-BREF), and COPE Inventory were administered. Results: Results indicated the presence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and impaired quality of life among the mothers. Despite this, they exhibited positive coping . Conclusion: As part of a comprehensive intervention for  with ASD, there is  a need to address the psychological distress and coping  of mothers."
The Direct and Indirect Influences of Parenting: The Facets of Time-Perspective and Impaired Control Along the Alcohol-related Problems Pathway,2019,"Background: Social Learning Theory suggests how one conceptualizes time will be passed from  to  (Bandura & Walters, 1963). Through the lens of Behavioral Economics Theory (Vuchinich & Simpson, 1998), impaired control may be characterized as consuming alcohol as a form of immediate gratification as a choice over more distal rewards. Because impaired control reflects a self-regulation failure specific to the drinking situation, it may be directly related to time-perspectives. Objectives: This investigation explored whether or not the indirect influences of perceived   on alcohol use and related problems is mediated by both facets of time-perspective (e.g. hedonism, -fatalism, future, past-positive, past-negative) and impaired control over drinking. Methods: We examined a structural equation model with 391 (207 women; 184 men) college student drinkers. We used an asymmetric bias-corrected bootstrap technique to conduct mediational analyses (MacKinnon, 2008). Results: Higher levels of past-positive time-perspective were indirectly linked to both less alcohol use and fewer alcohol-related problems through less impaired control. In contrast, higher levels of -fatalism were indirectly linked to more alcohol use through more impaired control. Higher levels of father permissiveness and mother authoritarianism were indirectly linked to both more impaired control and alcohol use through more -fatalism. In addition, higher levels of father authoritarianism were indirectly linked to more alcohol use through more hedonism. Conclusions/Implications: Our  support the notion that drinking beyond one's self-prescribed limits is associated with time-perspectives related to negative aspects of the -offspring socialization process, such as fatalism."
From authoritative parenting practices to an authoritarian context: Exploring the person-environment fit,2003,"This  examined whether authoritarian or authoritative  practices best prepare youth for coping with an authoritarian context (i.e., the mandatory military service of 18-year-old men in Israel) with specific reference to the issue of person-environment fit. A year before their conscription, 85 male adolescents (M age = 17.5) and their s filled out questionnaires regarding their relationships; during basic training, they did so again regarding the new recruit's coping and adaptation. Two peers from each adolescent's basic training unit  rated their coping and adaptation. Findings demonstrated that authoritative  practices were advantageous with respect to coping and adaptation in an authoritarian context and that these associations were to some extent mediated through the adolescents' self-esteem. These  are discussed in light of claims of limitations to the general benefit of the authoritative  ."
Parenting in a New Environment: Implications for Raising Sub-Saharan African Children Within the Australian Child Protection Context,2020,"International migration shapes   for migrant groups, but in Australia very little is known about the interplay between sub-Saharan African migrant  practices and beliefs concerning  protection expectations in the host society. This  explores how sub-Saharan African migrant s and caregivers navigate  between the cultures that have shaped their lives and  expectations within the new environment. Data were gathered from focus group discussions and one-on-one interviews. Major themes to emerge from the analysis included the importance of culture and a sense of the collectivity; of   in moulding good ; of family functioning and relationships; and of perceptions of  in the Australian context. Findings show how the participants introduce new dimensions and/or try to maintain a balance in rearing practices framed by traditional collectivist cultures when they adopt, incorporate, resist, or reject individualist dimensions as they deem necessary. The  demonstrates how participants navigate stressors when the dictates of social and school environments are different from those of their traditional family norms. It provides evidence for the implementation of culturally appropriate strategies for sub-Saharan African migrant families who come to the attention of the  protection system while settling in Australia."
EXAMINING THE RELATION OF PARENTING TO CHILDRENS COPING WITH EVERYDAY STRESS,1993,"The relation between  and the coping  of  in response to everyday stress was investigated. 60 , 9-10 years old, and their mothers participated. Children and mothers described how they responded to stressful episodes the  had experienced within the past 2 months. Mothers completed questionnaires that assessed a variety of  dimensions (e.g., nurturance, directiveness, organization). Results indicated that (a) the aspects of  coping studied (e.g., perceived effectiveness, variety of coping strategies) were relatively independent, (b)  from families with high levels of maternal support and relatively low levels of family structure used the greatest variety of coping strategies, (c)  of supportive mothers used the greatest number of avoidant strategies (but only in uncontrollable situations), and (d)  from families with high levels of al structure used fewer aggressive coping strategies."
Make room for daddy - The pragmatic potentials of a tag-team structure for sharing parenting,2001,"Research literature on fatherhood has featured a critical perspective on men's attitudes toward family life, their  of , and the amount they participate in myriad aspects of daily . This qualitative  explores the resourcefulness of men and women in families dedicated to organizing their family life to involve fathers. A tag-team pattern of sharing  emerged as a key to their success. While agreeing on the fundamentals of  care, these mothers and fathers valued differences in what each  contributes to the tag team. Both men and women in the  couples highlighted the pragmatic benefit of approaching  as a tag team requiring the full and unique contribution of each partner (mother and father). Pragmatic aspects of a tag team allow each partner to maintain certain specializations while remaining essentially interchangeable in function if not in form."
Temperament as a moderator of the effects of parenting on 's behavior,2015,"This  examined the role of  temperament as moderator of the effect of   on 's externalizing and internalizing behaviors. A series of structural equation models were fit to a reative sample of 2,631 Canadian  from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth. In addition to testing for the presence of Temperament x  interactions, these models  examined the direct and indirect effects of a number of additional contextual factors such as neighborhood problems, neighborhood cohesion, social support, and maternal depression. The  indicate that exposure to more positive  reduces behavior problems in  with difficult/unadaptable temperaments. No moderating effects of temperament on hostile  were found. Such  serve to highlight the pivotal role of positive features of the rearing environment as catalysts for the successful adaptation of  with difficult/unadaptable temperaments. The  of this modeling work  serve to emphasize the importance of considering the ways in which more distal factors can affect 's behavioral adaptation by contributing to changes in proximal family processes."
Practice-Based Evidence of Effectiveness in an Integrated Nutrition and Parenting Education Intervention for Low-Income Parents,2014,"Research identifying associations between al behaviors and 's food and activity choices and weight suggests that the integration of  and nutrition education holds promise for promoting healthful eating and activity in families. However, translational  leading to sustainable interventions lags behind. Development and testing of interventions within actual program contexts is needed to facilitate translation to full-scale implementation. Therefore, the goal of this pilot  was to develop and test an integrated nutrition and  education intervention for low-income families within the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program in New York State. During a 21-month period, low-income s of 3- to 11-year-olds were recruited through usual programmatic channels by nutrition program staff to participate in a series of eight workshops delivered to small groups. A validated self-administered questionnaire was used to assess behavior change outcomes among 210 s who completed the program. Mean scores improved significantly for most behaviors, including adult fruit and vegetable intake; adult and  low-fat dairy and soda intake; and  fast-food intake, activity, and screen time (P<0.001). Many s reported eating together with  at program entry, leaving little room to improve, but about 20% reported at least a 1-point improvement (on a 5-point scale). The most frequent change was reducing how often  ate fast food and was reported by >50% of s. Design and testing through practice-based  can facilitate development of interventions that are both feasible and likely to improve eating and activity behaviors among low-income families."
Can Parenting Practices Explain the Differences in Beverage Intake According to Socio-Economic Status: The Toybox-Study,2016,"Previous  indicated that preschoolers of lower socioeconomic status (SES) consume less healthy beverages than high SES preschoolers. The purpose of this  is to investigate the mediating role of  practices in the relationship between SES and plain water, soft drink and prepacked fruit juice (FJ) consumption in European preschoolers. s/caregivers of 3.5 to 5.5 years old (n = 6776) recruited through kindergartens in six European countries within the ToyBox- completed questionnaires on socio-demographics,  practices and a food frequency questionnaire. Availability of sugared beverages and plain water, permissiveness towards sugared beverages and lack of self-efficacy showed a mediating effect on SES-differences in all three beverages. Rewarding with sugared beverages significantly mediated SES-differences for both plain water and prepacked FJ. Encouragement to drink plain water and awareness significantly mediated SES-differences for, respectively, plain water and prepacked FJ consumption. Avoiding negative modelling did not mediate any associations. Overall, lower SES preschoolers were more likely to be confronted with lower levels of favourable and higher levels of unfavourable  practices, which may lead to higher sugared beverage and lower plain water consumption. The current  highlights the importance of  practices in explaining the relation between SES and both healthy and unhealthy beverage consumption."
"Self-esteem, response style and victimization - Possible ways of preventing victimization through parenting and school based training programmes",1996,"This paper describes the findings of a questionnaire survey of 377 eleven- and twelve-year-old students in two English secondary schools. The survey investigated the relationship between self-esteem, response  and the stressfulness of being bullied. Both students with high and low self-esteem had experienced bullying behaviour from their peers. However, those with low self-esteem and passive response  had been bullied more extensively and experienced greater stress as a  of this. The  suggest that those students who respond actively to bullying behaviour (either assertively or aggressively) experience less stress when they are bullied. The implications of these  for schools and s are discussed. Given that aggressive behaviour cannot be condoned in a school setting, the usefulness of assertiveness training as a targeted intervention for persistently bullied students is explored. This kind of intervention needs to be set within the context of a whole school anti-bullying policy and in conjunction with strategies for working with the students who are bullying others."
More than Mental Health: Parent Physical Health and Early Childhood Behavior Problems,2020,"Objective: Caring for young  is a physically demanding task, and some evidence suggests al physical limitations may impact the - relationship and  behavioral development, but  examining this dynamic is nascent. Methods: This  aims to explicate the role of general  physical health problems in  disruptive behavior outcomes. A model that included physical and mental health,   and self-efficacy, and  behavior symptom ratings was derived. The tenability of the model was assessed using Pearson's correlations, followed by structural equation modeling using data from 375 s with a  between 18 months and 5 years. Results: After several modifications to the initial model, findings revealed that higher levels of  self-reported physical and mental health concerns indirectly influence  behavior symptoms through different pathways. Impaired  physical health was associated with poorer al self-efficacy and more disruptive  behavior, whereas increased  mental health concerns were associated with a more negative   and lower self-efficacy, which was related to more  behavior symptoms. Conclusion: Findings elucidate the need for increased awareness and screening of  physical health limitations in pediatric primary care. Furthermore, appropriate interventions among s with physical health problems may target different aspects of  than routinely discussed."
Social anxiety in adolescence: psycho-evolutionary and family factors,2016,"Research on protective or risk factors of social anxiety in adolescence has advanced significantly in last decades. However, there is scarce evidence about the role of family and social context in the development of this problem. The aim of this  was to analyze the predictive value of  , al discipline, social competence and self-esteem, in the development of social anxiety during adolescence, taking into account the gender and age of adolescents. The sample consisted of 2060 Andalusian teenagers who were ing Obligatory Secondary Education (52.1% boys). Multiple regression analyses were performed. These analyses explained between 27.7% and 33.8% of the variance of social anxiety and highlighted its positive relationship with negative self-esteem, normative adjustment and al control, and its negative relationship with social adjustment. These  are discussed emphasizing the importance of focusing on supporting the development of self-esteem and social competence of youths and working with their s to promote positive  practices, adapted to the developmental level of the , to prevent social anxiety in adolescence."
Determinants of Persistence and Change in Early Childhood Behavioural Problems: The Roles of Parenting and Maternal Mental Health,2019,"ObjectivesThe current  aimed to investigate factors associated with the persistence and change in behavioural difficulties during early hood.MethodsThe  used data from the Growing Up in New Zealand birth cohort. Maternal-rated behavioural difficulties were assessed when  were aged 2 and 4.5 years (N=5885). The ninetieth percentile of the Strengths and Difficulties total difficulties score was used to identify  who showed serious behavioural difficulties at each time point, with  then categorised as showing no difficulties, improved behaviour, later difficulties, and persistent difficulties. Predictors of interest related to maternal-reported mental health and  behaviour, family social support and exposure to physical and verbal inter-al conflict.ResultsPoor maternal mental health at multiple time points and authoritarian and physical punishment   were associated with an increased likelihood of developing behavioural difficulties at 4.5 years and showing persistent difficulties from 2 to 4.5 years. Physical punishment and authoritarian    mediated the association between a history of verbal inter-al conflict and both developing later difficulties and persistent difficulties, whereas only physical punishment   mediated this association for a history of physical inter-al conflict. The only factor that distinguished  who improved from  who persisted was maternal  self-evaluation at 9 months; mothers who had a better self-evaluation were more likely to have  who persisted than improved.ConclusionsThese  demonstrate the importance of addressing mothers' self-reported management of their 's behavioural difficulties, inter-al conflict and maternal emotional wellbeing."
Tough Love or Laissez-Faire? Exploring the Feeding Styles of Urban Preschool Teachers and Associations with Nutrition-Focused Professional Development,2021,"The majority of  aged three to five in the U.S. attend care or preschool, where they may consume up to two-thirds of their daily calories and nutrition. Teachers at preschools serving low-income families are responsible for guiding  in their food choices. Feeding , or caregivers' overall emotional tone and approach at mealtimes, is believed to influence 's food choices and acceptance. While there is some  on  feeding , there is little on preschool teachers' feeding . This causal-comparative , using the Caregiver Feeding Style Questionnaire, examined the feeding  of 660 teachers at New York City preschools serving low-income families, comparing feeding  of teachers at preschools who received Eat Well Play Hard in Child Care Settings (EWPH) professional development (school response rate 90.4%) and those at preschools that did not (57.1%). Descriptive statistics, ANOVAs and Chi-Square tests were performed. Feeding  were calculated using a typological method. Teachers evenly spanned the four feeding  categories: authoritarian, authoritative, permissive, and uninvolved. There was no significant relationship between race/ethnicity and feeding . However, there were significant associations between years of teaching and whether teachers were s and feeding . EWPH training was not associated with feeding . Professional development interventions may more effectively target specific nutrition-related beliefs and practices than the broader concept of feeding , which, as prior  suggests, may remain mostly static over time."
"COUPLE RELATIONSHIPS, PARENTING STYLES, AND THE CHILDS DEVELOPMENT AT 3",1989,
The role of intrusive parenting in the relationship between peer management strategies and peer affiliation,2007,"The role of intrusive (i.e., psychologically controlling)  in the relationship between three peer management strategies (prohibiting, guiding, supporting) and adolescents' peer deviant behavior and peer group belongingness was examined. Three important findings emerged. First, consistent with previous , prohibiting was positively related to adolescents' affiliations with deviant friends, whereas support was positively related to a sense of group belongingness. Guiding was negatively related to group belongingness. Second, the direct effect of prohibiting on adolescents' affiliations with deviant friends was substantially accounted for by perceived al psychological control. Third, the effect of guiding was moderated by perceived psychological control, so that it negatively predicted a sense of group belongingness only under conditions of high psychological control. The findings indicate that al peer management strategies are associated with lower deviant and more positive peer affiliations, if they are not perceived as intruding upon adolescents' private world.

"Suppression in the study of parenting and adolescent symptoms: Statistical nuisance and nonsense, or scientific explanation?",1998,"Over 500 adolescents rated their s' discipline-relevant behaviors and their own problems with psychological and somatic symptoms. Most of the respondents lived in a medium-sized city or town setting and were surveyed in their high schools; a small sample of 26 detention center youngsters of similar age  participated. Consistent with a substantive interpretation of a suppressor variable effect, al permissiveness, although not related to symptom reports in simple bivariate correlations, significantly predicted higher symptoms.  warmth was shown to reduce symptoms directly, but increase symptoms indirectly through its tendency to increase permissiveness. The conceptually related   of indulgence showed a similar pattern, except that indulgence of girls did not directly affect symptoms. The direct beneficial influence of al warmth was larger and more consistent than its negative indirect influence through indulgence or permissiveness. Interpretations and limitations were discussed. Recommendations were made that social workers (I) attend more to  behaviors that are neither abusive nor neglectful, but importantly affect outcomes for , and (2) view  data in a complex and theoretical manner, so as not to overlook important effects hidden in near-zero bivariate relationships."
"The impostor phenomenon in British university students: Relationships between self-esteem, mental health, parental rearing style and socioeconomic status",2001,"The role of perceived al rearing , al background, self-esteem, mental health and demographic variables upon impostor phenomenon JP; Psychotherapy: Theory Research and Practice, 15, (1978) 241-247] intensity was investigated using a cross-sectional survey design, with 107 subjects (78 females, 29 males). A regression analysis revealed that both greater degree of perceived al control and lower levels of self-esteem emerged as significant predictors of impostor fears, together accounting for 50% of the variation in impostor scores. al care score, al educational and occupational level and subject's mental health and demographic information did not show a significant relationship to impostor scores. A post-hoc regression analysis indicated, however, that in addition to al protection, lower care and poorer mental health was significantly related to increasing levels of impostor scores and with subjects having attended private school reporting lower levels of impostor feelings. In addition, subjects classified as impostors were found to report significantly higher GHQ scores (poorer mental health) than non-impostors. These findings, which are interpreted in terms of  , indicate that the role of al overprotection may be especially implicated in impostor fears. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."
An investigation into the influence of gender and parenting styles on excessive exercise and disordered eating,2001,"Previous  has shown a gender difference in the incidence of eating disorders, with a far higher number of female sufferers. This  aimed to re-examine this gender difference, and  any difference in primary excessive exercise, based on Lerner et al.'s (1976) theoretical distinction between 'body effectiveness' and 'body attractiveness'. It  considered the significance of al  to abnormal eating and exercising behaviour. As predicted, young adult females demonstrated significantly higher levels of disordered eating than young adult males while the reverse was the case for excessive exercise. The degree of these behavioural abnormalities was related to low body satisfaction and subjects' weight perceptions. For both sexes, mother and father overprotection was associated with low body satisfaction, and, for female subjects, disordered eating patterns. These  are discussed in relation to Lerner et al.'s (1976) theory and the models proposed by Eisler and Le Grange (1990). Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

The Perceived Maternal Parenting Self-Efficay (PMP S-E) Tool: the adaptation study in the context of attachment styles and mood in the first-time mothers,2021,"Objective: Maternal self-efficacy is defined as beliefs about one's ability to be successful in the maternal role. Studies have shown that perceived maternal self-efficacy was related to maternal depression, the perception of infant temperament, and the quality of mother-infant interactions. The purpose of this  was to conduct an adaptation  of the Turkish version of Perceived Maternal  Self-Efficacy Tool (PMP S-E Tool). Method: For this purpose, three different  samples which were composed of the first-time mothers of full-term healthy infants were reached out. The mothers in the first sample (n=290) filled out the Turkish PMP S-E online for construct validity and internal consistency analyses. The mothers in the second  sample (n=50) filled out the Turkish PMP S-E, the CES-Depression Scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Early Close Relationships-II, and the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-VSF online for criterion and predictive validity analyses. The mothers in the third  sample (n=57) filled out the Turkish PMP S-E twice, post-partum pre-test at their home and 4-month post-test at the laboratory. Results: The  of Confirmatory Factor Analysis supported the four-factor structure of the original PMP S-E. The sub-scales were Care Taking Procedures, Evoking Behaviors, Reading Behaviors, and Situational Beliefs. Internal consistency values of the Turkish PMP S-E total and sub-scales were high. The  of criterion validity and test-re-test reliability provided evidence for the Turkish PMP S-E total and sub-scale scores. Predictive validity findings demonstrated that total scores of the Turkish PMP S-E were predictive of maternal life satisfaction. Conclusion: Findings provided support for the reliability and validity of the Turkish PMP S-E for the first time-mothers with infants between 0-12 months. The Turkish PMP S-E was considered to have both  and clinical utility."
Confirmatory factor analysis of the Infant Feeding Styles Questionnaire in Latino families,2016,"Background:  feeding practices affect risk of obesity in . Latino  are at higher risk of obesity than the general population, yet valid measure of feeding practices, one of which is the Infant Feeding Styles Questionnaire (IFSQ), have not been formally validated in Spanish. Objective: To validate the IFSQ among Latino families, we conducted confirmatory factor analysis of pressuring, restrictive, and responsive feeding constructs from the IFSQ Design/Methods: The IFSQ was administered at the 12-month visit in the Greenlight , a multi-center cluster randomized trial to prevent obesity. s were included if they were of Latino origin (n = 303) and completed an English or Spanish language modified IFSQ (without the indulgence construct). Scores from nine sub-constructs of the IFSQ were compared between English and Spanish language versions. We tested reliability with Cronbach's alpha coefficients and performed confirmatory factor analysis to examine factor loadings and goodness of fit characteristics, modifying constructs to achieve best fit. Results: Of 303 s completing the IFSQ 84% were born outside the US, and 74% completed the IFSQ in Spanish. Reliability coefficients ranged from 0.28 to 0.61 for the laissez-faire sub-constructs and from 0.58 to 0.83 for the pressuring, restrictive, and responsive sub-constructs. Results for all coefficients were similar between participants responding to an English and Spanish version of the 1FSQ, Goodness of fit indices ranged from CFI 0.82-1 and RMSEA 0.00-0.31, and the model performed best in pressuring soothing (CFI 1.0, RMSEA 0.00) and restrictive-amount (CFI 0.98, RMSEA 0.1) sub-constructs. Conclusions: In a sample of Latino families, pressuring, restrictive, and responsive constructs performed well. The modified IFSQ in both English and Spanish-speaking Latino families may be used to assess  behaviors related to early obesity risk in this at-risk population. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Mothers of  with externalizing behavior problems: Cognitive risk factors for abuse potential and discipline style and practices,2008,"Objective: utilizing the conceptual framework of the Social Information Processing (SIP) model (Milner, 1993, 2000), associations between cognitive risk factors and  physical abuse risk and maladaptive discipline  and practices were examined in an at-risk population. Methods: Seventy-three mothers of 5-12-year-old , who were identified by their therapist as having an externalizing behavior problem, responded to self-report measures pertaining to cognitive risk factors (empathic perspective taking, frustration tolerance, developmental expectations,  locus of control), abuse risk, and discipline  and practices. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) provided a confirmation of the 's externalizing behaviors independent of the therapist's assessment. Results: The  of this  suggest several cognitive risk factors significantly predict Fisk of al aggression toward . A 's ability to empathize and take the perspective of their , al locus of control, and al level of frustration tolerance were significant predictors of abuse potential (accounting for 63% of the variance) and inappropriate discipline practices (accounting for 55% of the variance). Conclusions: Findings of the   Provide support for processes theorized in the SIP model. Specifically,  underscore the potential role of s' frustration tolerance, developmental expectations, locus of control, and empathy as predictive of abuse potential and disciplinary  in an at-Fisk sample.

Impact of Perceived Social Support and Depression on the Parental Attitudes of Mothers of Children Who are Deaf,2013,"Literature shows that mothers of  with disabilities report high levels of depression. Social support facilitates the well-being of mothers and it helps to cope with a range of disability related stressors. This  was designed to assess the impact of having a  who is deaf on maternal depression and to test how social support may facilitate coping with the depression caused by deafness as well as the  behaviors of those mothers. 103 mothers of  who are deaf, ranging from the 36 months to 72 months of age participated in the . al attitude  instrument, beck depression inventory and multidimensional scale of perceived social support were used for data collection. Results showed that 24.4 % of the mothers showed depression and perceived social support from family and friends were found to be predicting depression. Further analysis showed that depression was found to be affecting authoritarian and hostile  . Perceived social support from friends and significant other did not have significant effect on al attitudes. The findings showed that having a  who is deaf causes high levels of depression in mothers which leads to insufficient and/or inappropriate  attitudes. On the other hand, social support is a protective source lowering depression levels of mothers as well as indirectly facilitating the maintenance of positive ."

Children and the public realm: antecedents and consequences of independent mobility in a group of 11-13-year-old Italian ,2013,"Access to several play environments, as well as exploration of public spaces and socialization with peers, is crucial for 's development. Western  are often deprived of these opportunities and independent mobility is constantly decreasing. In the  , we aimed to test an integrative model of the antecedents and consequences of independent mobility and to preliminarily explore the relationship between   and independent mobility in a group of 589 Italian . We expected and found that being female and being younger predicted less independent mobility. In turn, we found that lower independent mobility predicted greater feelings of loneliness through the mediation of a weaker sense of community, a lower sense of safety and less frequent social activities with friends. Moreover, we found that independent mobility changed according to different configurations of  ."
School adjustment among Spanish adolescents: influence of parental socialization,2015,"The values and attitudes toward education that s transmit to their  considerably affect their school adjustment. The aim of this  was to analyse the relationships between academic adjustment in Spanish adolescents and al socialization . Participants in the  were 487 adolescents (53.9% females) between 12 and 14 years old (M = 13.13, SD = 0.79). Based on their responses on a al socialization scale, families were classified according to the classic four   typology (authoritative, indulgent, authoritarian or neglectful). Academic performance, number of school years repeated, academic self-concept and disruptive school behaviour were evaluated as adjustment criteria. Unlike the findings from studies conducted in other cultural contexts,  of the   indicated that the best academic adjustment corresponded to adolescents from indulgent families, highlighting the importance of al involvement, support, affection and dialogue for the optimal academic adjustment of  in the Spanish cultural context."
Associations between autonomic nervous system activity and risk-taking and internalizing behavior in young adolescents,2021,"Dysregulated autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity has been associated with adolescent risk-taking and internalizing behavior, but previous  in community samples have been mixed. We investigated whether ANS activity was associated with higher risk-taking and internalizing behavior in young adolescents (age 11/12; n = 875), and whether adolescents' gender, s'   or a combination of both moderated these associations. Adolescents and their s were recruited as part of the population-based, longitudinal Amsterdam Born Children and their Development (ABCD) . Risk-taking behavior was assessed with the Balloon Analogue Risk Task and the personality characteristics sensation seeking and impulsivity, measured with the Substance Use Risk Profile Scale (SURPS). Internalizing behavior was assessed via the SURPS subscales anxiety sensitivity and hopelessness. Authoritative (AUTH-SW) and authoritarian (AUTH-S)   were measured with the  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire. Resting ANS activity was assessed via heart rate and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Hierarchical, multivariable regression analyses showed higher RSA, but not heart rate, being associated with higher risk-taking behavior and sensation seeking. The associations between ANS activity and risk-taking variables were not significantly moderated by gender, , or interactions between gender and . Our findings suggest that RSA activity may be a relevant factor in mild to moderate risk-taking behavior in adolescents from the general population, regardless of their gender or the type of  they experience."
Mother-Child Relationship in Youths with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and their Siblings,2017,"Despite impaired mother- interactions noted in youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), there is no such information for their siblings. This  aimed to test whether the affected and unaffected siblings, like youth with ADHD,  encountered impaired mothering and mother- relationships as compared to typically developing youth (TD). The sample consisted of 122 probands (107 males, 87.7 %), aged 10-16, with DSM-IV ADHD, 44 affected (26 males, 59.1 %) and 78 unaffected (28 males, 35.9 %) siblings, and 122 TD youth. Both participants and their mothers received psychiatric interviews (K-SADS-E) about the participants and reported maternal  , mother- interactions and  behavioral problems at home. Based on both reports, probands with ADHD and affected siblings (only youth report) had more impaired relationships, more behavioral problems at home, and less perceived family support than unaffected siblings and TD youth. Probands with ADHD had higher maternal authoritarian control than unaffected siblings. The findings suggest that impaired mothering, mother- interactions, and family support are related to the presence of ADHD diagnosis in both probands and their affected siblings."
The influence of environmental pressure on Internet Use Disorder in adolescents: The potential mediating role of cognitive function,2020,"Purpose: The current  attempts to clarify the mediating role of cognitive function on the relationship between environmental pressure (pressure caused by negative   and dysfunctional school environments) and Internet Use Disorder (IUD); this  explores the effects of sex and left-behind  (LBC). Methods: A cross-sectional sample of adolescents aged 12-15 years was recruited in 2018. A total of 3048 junior high school adolescents in rural areas of the Sichuan province in western China completed a series of psychological inventories, including the Adolescent Pathological Internet Use Scale (APIUS), the Junior High School Students' Perceived School Climate Inventory (PSCI-M), the Egna Minnen av. Barndoms Uppfostran (EMBU), and the Mental Health Screening Inventory for Children and Adolescents (MHS-C), for an analysis of IUD, school climate,   and cognition, respectively. Results: Among the participants, 18.5% (N = 565) exhibited significant symptoms of IUD. The correlation analysis showed that IUD was positively correlated with s' punishment, rejection and over-interference and academic pressure, whereas IUD was negatively associated with good teacher-student relationships, good schoolmate relationships and cognitive function scores. Structural equation modelling (SEM) showed that cognitive function partially contributed to the association between family and school pressures and IUD. Discussion: Cognitive function is one of the mediating pathways through which environmental pressures may predict IUD among junior high school students. Interventions may target the mediating pathway of cognitive function to alleviate the negative impact of environmental pressure on IUD."
"Advertising Unhealthy Food to Children: on the Importance of Regulations, Parenting Styles, and Media Literacy",2021,"Purpose of Review Childhood obesity is a global health concern. And a number of studies have indicated that food promotions affect 's food attitudes, preferences, and food choices for foods high in fat and sugar, which potentially impacts 's body weight development. This review showcases how  are affected by food promotions, why companies even target  with their promotional efforts, and what makes  so susceptible to promotion of unhealthy food. In addition, this review discusses how regulations, al , and individual media literacy skills can help to contain the potential detrimental effects of food promotions on 's health. Recent Findings The recent findings indicate that  are affected by food promotions in their preference for unhealthy food and beverages in selection tasks shortly conducted after exposure. Furthermore,  indicate significant effects of food marketing, including enhanced attitudes, preferences, and increased consumption of marketed (predominantly unhealthy) foods connected with a wide range of marketing strategies. Children are particularly vulnerable to promotional efforts and react to it strongly due to their still developing cognitive and social skills as well as their lack in inhibitory control. This review proposes an applied focus that discusses pathways for regulators, s, and educators. In the light of the discussed , a large number of studies on food promotion indicate that there is need to react. In all these measures, however, it is of relevance to consider 's developmental stages to effectively counteract and respond to the potential detrimental effects of food promotions on 's long-term weight development."
"Association of fathers' feeding practices and feeding style on preschool age 's diet quality, eating behavior and body mass index",2015,"The associations of al feeding practices and feeding  with hood obesity have gained more attention in the literature recently; however, fathers are rarely included within these studies. The aim of this  was to determine the relationship of paternal feeding practices on  diet quality, weight status, and eating behavior, and the moderating effect of paternal feeding  on these relationships in preschool age . This  included a one-time, one-on-one interview with biological fathers of preschoolers (n = 150) to assess feeding practices (Child Feeding Questionnaire), feeding  (Caregiver Feeding Style Questionnaire),  eating behaviors (Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire), and diet quality (24 hour recall, Healthy Eating Index). Height and weight for each father and  were  measured and Body Mass Index (BMI) or BMI z-score calculated. Linear regression was used to test the relationship between paternal feeding practices,  and  diet quality and/or body weight. Overall, the findings revealed that a father's feeding practices and feeding  are not associated with 's diet quality or weight status. However,  eating behaviors are associated with  BMI z-score and these relationships are moderated by paternal feeding practices. For example,  satiety responsiveness is inversely (beta = -.421, p = 0.031) associated with  BMI z-score only if paternal restriction scores are high. This relationship is not significant when paternal restriction scores are low (beta=-.200, p = 0.448). These  suggest that some  appetitive traits may be related to  weight status when exposed to certain paternal feeding practices. Future studies should consider the inclusion of fathers as their feeding practices and feeding  may be related to a 's eating behavior. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Paternal and Maternal Variables Related to Depression in Childhood,2020,"Several studies have highlighted the relationship between   and depression in . The aim of this  is to ascertain whether there are differences in the  practices received by two groups of  who obtain low-risk and high-risk scores respectively in relation to depression and determine which  variables are linked with the presence or absence of this kind of internalizing problem. From a sample of 550 subjects, obtained by probabilistic cluster sampling, we selected 140  between 3 and 12 years of age who met a set of specific criteria as having high risk scores (70 ) for depression according to the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC) or having low scores in this variable (70 ). Then, the -Child Relationship Inventory (PCRI) was applied to both s. We carried out a binomial logistic regression analysis which ed in a prediction model for 89.3% of the sample, based on the following  variables: limit setting and involvement from the mothers, and al support, autonomy, satisfaction with , and communication from the fathers. Finally, the usefulness of our  to plan intervention strategies within families of  with depression is discussed."
Personality and Family Context in Explaining Grit of Taiwanese High School Students,2017,"Grit, one of the newly developed non-cognitive traits, encompasses the characteristics of perseverance and consistency of interest. Grit is associated with good academic performance, resilience, and well-being. To understand the nature of Grit in detail, this  probed the relationship between Grit and the widely-applied and well-established Big-Five personality. Family context plays a significant role in nurturing all aspects of personality traits. Accordingly, we examined two family-context variables, namely family influence and democratic  , which may be predictive of Grit, particularly in an Asian context. A total of 1504 students from one private comprehensive high school participated. Multiple linear regression was conducted to determine how the various independent variables affect Grit characteristics. The  indicate that grittier high school learners tend to display higher self-report academic performance and academic satisfaction. Multiple regression demonstrated that the four Big-Five personality traits: Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, Intellect/Imagination, are significantly predictive of Grit, with the exception of Extraversion. While family influence is predictive of Grit, democratic   does not predict Grit. Based on the , several possible explanations and suggestions are proposed."

This familial high risk design indicated differences in family environment,  , and in  of bipolar s' perception of their family environment as it relates to their current mood."
Mothers' experiences of parenting a  with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,2009,"Mothers' experiences of  a  with attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder. This paper is a report of a  to explore the perceptions and experiences of mothers  a  with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Previous quantitative studies have focussed on   and treatments, and highlight that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder has a negative impact on family functioning. However, fewer ers have explored maternal experiences of  a  with this disorder. A narrative-based feminist approach can provide greater insights into complex issues related to mothering a  with this disorder. Data were collected in 2007 with a volunteer sample of 11 mothers of  with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder via in-depth interviews. Analysis was completed by listening for self-evaluative statements, paying attention to meta-statements and by identifying both consistencies and incongruities within participant's narratives. Dominant issues identified were: It's been 10 years of being on edge: The caring responsibility as overwhelming; If I had my time over again, I wouldn't tell the truth: Stigmatized, scrutinized and criticized; What have I done? What did I do? How come I've got this : Guilt and self-blame and He doesn't stand a chance: Mother as advocate. Mothering a  with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is stressful and demanding, and mothers felt marginalized. Media portrayal of this disorder contributes to confusion related to causes, diagnosis and treatment choices. More education for healthcare professionals is needed to enable them to give appropriate guidance and support to enhance outcomes for  and their s."
Chinese Parents' Expectations and Child Preacademic Skills: The Indirect Role of Parenting and Social Competence,2017,"Research Findings: This  examined how   and  social-emotional functioning may help explain the indirect relations between Chinese s' expectations for their preschool-age 's social-emotional development and their 's preacademic skills. A total of 154 s with preschool-age  were recruited from 7 preschools located in northeastern China. The  showed that when s expected their  to master social-emotional skills at a younger age or when they placed more value on social-emotional skills, they were more likely to adopt authoritative , their  had better social competence, and finally their  showed better preacademic skills. The findings not only provided support for the interconnections between Chinese young 's social-emotional functioning and preacademic skills but  revealed   and  social competence as potential pathways through which s' social-emotional expectations relate to 's preacademic skills. Practice or Policy: The findings can be used to facilitate  education efforts to help contemporary Chinese s reflect on and even adjust their developmental expectations for young . al expectations can  be an important element to consider in prevention and intervention programs that are designed to improve young 's social-emotional and preacademic skills."
ORIGINS OF SOCIAL IMMOBILITY AND INEQUALITY: PARENTING AND EARLY CHILD DEVELOPMENT,2008,"There is growing evidence that differences in 's intellectual, emotional and behavioural development by s' socio-economic status emerge at early ages and that these differences cast a long shadow over subsequent achievements. This article demonstrates with the Millennium Cohort Study that differences by s' income group in cognitive and behavioural development emerge by the 's third birthday. It shows that an important part of these differences can be accounted for by 'what s do' in terms of educational activities and  ."
Examining the effects of parental rearing styles on first-year university students' audience-facing apprehension and exploring self-esteem as the mediator,,"The term 'audience-facing apprehension' (AFA) was coined by Chinese psychologists to describe an issue faced by Chinese university students wherein they experience worry, tension, anxiety, or fear when facing more than two listeners or spectators. This  attempted to explore the specific correlation between positive and negative   and first-year university students' AFA specifically by identifying the mediating factor (i.e. self-esteem) influencing this relationship. A sample of 1060 first-year university students (M-age = 19.43, SD = 1.06) was recruited from universities in southwest China who completed questionnaires measuring AFA,  , and self-esteem. Structural equation model  confirmed that (1) al care(such as emotional warmth), an aspect of positive , is significantly and negatively correlated to the students' AFA; (2) al control (such as rejection and overp rotection), an aspect of negative , is significantly and positively correlated to the students' AFA; and (3) self-esteem is a significant mediator in the relationship between al  and AFA. Thus, this  confirmed that   and self-esteem level were important factors of university students' AFA and further revealed that   is not only directly related to the students' AFA, but is  indirectly related to AFA through self-esteem. This implies that aspects of positive , such as emotional warmth, will help to improve freshmen's self-esteem, which will in turn reduce their AFA. Conversely, aspects of negative , such as rejection and overprotection, will reduce freshmen's self-esteem, which will in turn significantly increase their AFA."
Selective mutism: More than social anxiety,2006,"This  investigated the relationship between selective mutism (SM), social phobia (SP), oppositionality, and  . Twenty-one  with SP, 21  with SM and SP, and 21 normal  ages 7-15, and the mother Of each , participated in an assessment of psychopathological factors potentially related to SM. Children with SM did not endorse higher levels of social anxiety than did  with SP, although clinicians gave higher severity ratings to those who bad both disorders. In addition, although a dimensional measure of oppositionality (Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory) did not reveal group differences, there were significantly more diagnoses of oppositional defiant disorder among  with SM (29%) in comparison to  with SP alone (5%). With respect to  , there were no significant differences among s of  with SM and the other groups, except that  with SP reported significantly less warmth/acceptance from s than normal . These data replicate previous findings that  with SM do not report greater social anxiety than other  with a SP diagnosis. Furthermore, they suggest that oppositional behaviors may be part of the clinical ation of a subset of  with SM."
CHILD-ABUSE POTENTIAL INVENTORY AND PARENTING BEHAVIOR - RELATIONSHIPS WITH HIGH-RISK CORRELATES,1995,"The primary purpose of this  was to examine the construct validity of the Child Abuse Potential Inventory by comparing maltreating and high-risk s' CAP Inventory abuse scores to their behavior during interactions with their . A second purpose was to determine the degree to which CAP Inventory scores and  behavior were related to several known correlates of abuse, as measured by  and teacher reports. Participants (n = 41) included abusive and high-risk s and their  referred to a treatment group. Correlational analyses revealed that CAP Inventory scores and observed   yielded highly related findings, supporting construct validity of the CAP Inventory. However, the CAP Inventory and observed behavior index showed a different pattern of relationships to the risk correlates. Implications for assessment of risk status are discussed and recommendations are provided for continued ."
How do parents and  promote each other? The impact of intergenerational learning on willingness to save energy,2022,"The  to cope with energy shortages and mitigate climate change has mainly focused on industry, technology, and adults, and has neglected a very important stakeholder group: . They are beneficiaries of current energy saving initiatives and the implementers of future energy policies. New  shows that  can  provide breakthroughs in improving the entrenched thinking of adult s. In order to clarify the interplay between s' and 's willingness to save energy, a large-scale survey was conducted in Jiangsu Province, China (N = 3012) from a two-way intergenerational learning perspective. The  show that: (1) s -> Children: The family   significantly predicts 's willingness to save energy, with moral identity and moral disengagement playing a mediating role. (2) Children -> s: Girls in families with permissive and open   have a significant effect on their s' willingness to save energy. Additionally,  over the age of 18 years appear to be effective in influencing s' willingness to invest in energy efficient products. Our  confirmed the effectiveness of family relationships in promoting two-way s- energy saving. Finally, we propose suggestions for promoting an increased willingness to save energy by everyone from the government, school, and family levels."
Poverty exposure and cognitive abilities of  in rural China: Causation and the roles of family investments,2021,"Family poverty may affect family investments, which affect 's cognitive development. Based on a unique and nationally reative sample from the National Children's Study of China (NCSC), this  aimed to explore the relationship between poverty and 's cognitive abilities and the roles of different investments to the cognitive gaps. We had the following three findings. First, the cognitive abilities of  in poor families were significantly and negatively affected by their families' poverty status. Second, poverty was significantly correlated with lower family education expenditures, lower expectations of s for their 's education, and more permissive  . Finally, the  of the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method showed that family educational expenditures, educational expectations, and permissive   accounted for substantial portions of the gaps in cognitive abilities."
"Gay Fathers by Surrogacy: Prejudice, Parenting, and Well-Being of Female and Male Children",2019,"This  focused on behavioral functioning of  conceived via gestational surrogacy and raised by gay fathers. Gay fathers from 68 families with  aged 3-10 years completed the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist. Their scores were compared to those from a normative sample of s matched for 's occupation and 's gender, age, and race/ethnicity. Children of gay fathers received significantly lower scores on internalizing (anxiety, depression) and externalizing (aggression, rule-breaking) than  in the comparison sample. Most notably, daughters of gay fathers had significantly lower internalizing scores than did daughters in the national database. Gay fathers  completed measures of  , social support, and perceived prejudice. Fathers who reported less authoritarian or permissive , more positive co, and more social support from friends had  with fewer behavior problems. Gay fathers' reports of family members receiving higher levels of antigay microaggressions were associated with s' greater stigma consciousness, more anger/aggression from spouse/partner, and less positive  and co. Results are discussed in terms of gay and heterosexual s' gender-related socialization of daughters' internalizing problems and the impact of minority stress on same-sex couples' ."
Effectiveness of laws and policies governing permissive parenting in pursuit of the reduction of severe  abuse in Germany,2020,"Laws and policies governing permissive  in Germany including provisional withdrawal of al custody coupled with  taken preventively into custody (Inobhutnahme) by the German Youth Welfare Offices (Jugendamt) seem to uncover cases of severe  abuse in Germany from the dark into the light field but may not actually have a significant effect on controlling and decreasing such cases. In the year 2000, the German government enforced a series of prohibitive laws in Germany's civil and social codes to preventively protect  from violence. The costs for processes including continuous monitoring of al compliance to these laws reached 12.6 billion EUR in the year 2018 with an increase of 146% since 2001. The number of withdrawals of al custody rose by 65% to approximately 11,000 cases in the same period. The number of  taken preventively into custody due to suspected  maltreatment, abuse or neglect increased by 29% to 40,379 cases in the year 2018. However, the actual number of cases of severe  abuse in Germany did not decline as anticipated, but rose by 39%, close to 3,500 reported cases in the year 2018. The European Parliament issued a resolution highlighting the large number of petitions received regarding the role of the German Youth Welfare Office involved in alleged discrimination. s in Germany may be unduly criminalized by preventive intervention in basic  rights. From an ethical and legal point of view, the German government may wish to revise the current legislation in the various codes so s regain freedom to individually chose the most suitable   similar to the Canadian model with proven outcomes regarding maintenance of  wellbeing, prohibition of severe  abuse and effectiveness of reducing family violence."
Longitudinal Associations Between Adolescent Perceived Degree and Style of Parental Prohibition and Internalization and Defiance,2014,"This  examined associations between perceived degree and  of al prohibition and adolescents' internalization of and oppositional defiance against al rules in the friendship and moral domain. Relations were investigated in 2 longitudinal adolescent samples ( total N = 532). Results indicated that perceived  but not degree of prohibition related to overtime changes in internalization and oppositional defiance. Specifically, in line with self-determination theory, autonomy-supportive and controlling  of prohibiting were found to relate differentially to quality of internalization and oppositional defiance. Cross-lagged analyses indicated that several of these associations were reciprocal. The discussion focuses on the critical role of perceived al  for communicating prohibitions."
"Perceived parental attitude, alexithymia and defense style in psychiatric outpatients",1998,"Background: Although it is the clinical impression that alexithymia may be due to disturbances in the early - relationship and that it is associated with primitive defense mechanisms, a possible association with neurotic defense mechanisms, such as repression and reaction formation, has  been mentioned. However, empirical studies on these and related issues are scarce. The aim of this  was to determine the association between perceived al attitude, defense mechanisms and alexithymia. Methods: In a cross-sectional  we obtained data from 78 psychiatric outpatients. Alexithymia, defense mechanisms and perceived al attitude were measured with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale, the Defense Style Questionnaire and the al Bonding Instrument. Results: We found only weak associations between perceived al attitude and alexithymic features. Primitive and adaptive defenses were associated with alexithymic features in a clinically sensible way. The strongest association was found between primitive defense mechanisms and alexithymic features. There was hardly any association between neurotic defense mechanisms and alexithymic features. Conclusions: The  of our  support the hypothesis that alexithymia is associated with a primitive defense , whereas a relation to disturbances in early - relationship could not be confirmed. It is argued that possibly more severe traumatic experiences, such as physical and sexual abuse, than merely a negatively perceived al attitude, are necessary to develop alexithymic features."
Parenting dimensions in mothers and fathers of  with Autism Spectrum Disorders,2014,"Rearing a  with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a unique challenge for both s. Previous studies addressed how mothers are affected by the challenges of raising a  with ASD, mostly in terms of stress pattern. In this , we focused on comparisons between mothers and fathers of  with ASD in al stress, attitude and mental health. We examined 99 s of  with ASD using the  Stress Index-Short Form, the al Style Questionnaire, the Self-Perceptions of the al Role and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised. The  revealed the gender differences in the al attitude and mental health. Mothers reported that they engaged in more social behaviors with their  than fathers. In addition mothers reported higher level of depression than fathers. No difference among s emerged in the  Stress Index-Short Form. The  of a multiple regression analysis revealed that  distress is associated with depression, balance of s' diverse roles in their life and dysfunctional interaction between s and . These findings highlight both similarities and differences between mothers and fathers of  with ASD and the existence of a relationship between al stress, mental health and attitude. Results suggest the importance of developing specific intervention programs which incorporate these fundamental  domains. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Multiple linear regression showed that father's employment status (B = 6.970, 95 % CI = 3.172, 10.768, p < 0.001) and perceived  weight (B = 3.338, 95 % CI = 1.350, 5.327, p = 0.001) predicted autism severity. Conclusions and implications: Children with ASD in this  had a high level of autism severity. Regular anthropometric measurements by healthcare professionals should be conducted at the autism intervention centres. It is important to have multidisciplinary collaboration in future  to develop customised guidelines for s with autistic ."
Parenting issues and behaviour problems of young  in a community sample,1999,"Forty s of  aged between 1 and 8 years were recruited by means of an exhaustive telephone survey of a defined suburban area in regional Queensland. Following recruitment, s were mailed a family survey comprising measures of  and  behaviour problems. The sample res almost 50% of s of young  in the defined area. Forty-four per cent of s in the sample reported numbers of  behaviours as problems that exceeded recommended clinical cut-off scores based on data reported in other studies. Thirty per cent of s reported problems occurring at an intensity that exceeded clinical cut-off scores. Fathers who completed the questionnaires reported significantly more problems than mothers, although the ratio of mothers to fathers in the sample was 3:1. However, there was no difference between the reported behaviours of boys or girls.  characteristics that were highly correlated with reported  behaviour problems were overreactivity; stress, anxiety, and depression; and al satisfaction with their  . Family and other demographic variables appeared to play less significant roles. The  are discussed in the context of the challenge of delivering effective early-intervention  programs to large numbers of s."
Childhood parenting experiences and adult creativity,1999,"The  investigation used a prospective, longitudinal design,to examine the relation of preschool  experiences to adult creativity, as measured by ratings of imaginative stories and by the Creative Personality Scale. Results revealed that al conflict was significantly positively related to later adult levels of creativity. al conflict was assessed in terms of al disagreement. al warmth and nonrestrictiveness were not reliably associated with creativity.

A critical look at parenting  from the mainstream: Problems uncovered while adapting Western  to non-Western cultures,2002,"Although there is some consensus among theorists regarding attributes of s that associate with optimal  outcomes, translation of the theory into measures has been variable and inconsistent. These inconsistencies have been surprisingly little noted in the literature and  a particular problem to ers seeking to   in little examined cultures. This article describes these inconsistencies, and suggests some practical resolutions based on the writers' recent experience of ing  in Islamic cultures. Some dilemmas and choice points described are: the use of typologies vs. dimensions; measures of   vs. practices; the limited number of items in most current scales of '' as opposed to 'practice' domains; strategies to assess the validity of  practices when the culture-specific 'meaning' of the behaviour is not known; and the implications of the greater degree of gender differentiation in cultures studied. Steps proposed as criteria for assembling scales and determining psychometric acceptability when adapting measures to new cultures are outlined. It is the goal of this article to raise discussion both about the inconsistencies and lack of standardization of measures in the  of , and about guidelines for future studies charting new territory. Such discussion is timely as developmental psychology takes on an increasingly global perspective."
Parental Styles in the Intergenerational Transmission of Trauma Stemming From the Khmer Rouge Regime in Cambodia,2013,"The impact of al  in intergenerational transmission of trauma among mothers who survived the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, in power from 1975 to 1979, and their teenaged  was examined in 2 studies. In Study 1, 46 Cambodian female high school students and their mothers were recruited. Each daughter completed anxiety and depression measures as well as assessment of her mother's role-reversing, overprotective, and rejecting al , whereas the mothers completed measures of their trauma exposure during the Khmer Rouge regime and PTSD symptoms. In support of trauma transmission, the mother's PTSD symptoms were predictive of her daughter's anxiety. Moreover, the mother's role-reversing al  was shown to mediate the relationship between her own and her daughter's symptoms. In support of their generalizability, the  were replicated in Study 2 in a Cambodian-American refugee sample comparing 15 mental health treatment-seeking mothers and their teenaged  with 17 nontreatment-seeking mother- pairs. The implications of the findings within the larger literature on intergenerational trauma transmission stemming from genocide are discussed."
Parenting Practices in Preschool Leading to Later Cognitive Competence: A Family Stress Model,2014,"Research Findings: This  investigates the effect of the early home environment on self-regulation in preschoolers, and how self-regulation relates to later school achievement, while taking into account family resources. Participants were part of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. Our model tested paths from family income and maternal depression through  to dyadic and  outcomes, including attachment, self-regulation, and  cognitive outcomes in the 1st grade. Findings indicated that family income and maternal depression had a substantial effect on  practices. Children whose s did not display negative affect toward them during episodes of depression were more likely to maintain healthy attachment . , which was directly affected by family income, was the most important predictor of 's cognitive development. Practice or Policy: Regarding implications for practice, this  indicates that s who provide a safe and stimulating environment for their , despite limited financial resources or mental health issues, are more likely to have  who are prepared for school. School counselors,  care administrators, and policymakers should be aware of the importance of  to school success and should provide opportunities for  education and involvement during the first years of life."
Perceptions of parental treatment styles and adolescent antisocial and prosocial behavior in a Chinese context,1997,"Chinese secondary school students (N=912) were asked to respond to instruments measuring their recalled al treatment  as well as their antisocial and prosocial behavior. Results showed that while those who had a more positive perception of paternal or maternal treatment  (in terms of warmth and leniency) showed less antisocial behavior, only recalled maternal treatment  was positively related to prosocial behavior. The data  revealed that relative to recalled paternal treatment, recalled maternal treatment was found to be more predictive of antisocial and prosocial behavior measures. These findings generally do not support the Chinese popular beliefs that a kind mother spoils the son and that al harshness is beneficial to the development of a ."
Sub-optimal parenting is associated with schizotypic and anxiety personality traits in adulthood,2013,"Part of the variation in personality characteristics has been attributed to the - interaction and sub-optimal  has been associated with psychiatric morbidity. In the  , an extensive battery of personality scales (Trait Anxiety Inventory, Behavioural Inhibition/Activation System questionnaire, Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised, Temperament and Character Inventory, Schizotypal Traits Questionnaire, Toronto Alexithymia Scale) and the al Bonding Instrument (PBI) were administered in 324 adult healthy males to elucidate the effects of  on personality configuration. Personality variables were analysed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the factors Schizotypy, Anxiety, Behavioural activation, Novelty seeking and Reward dependence were extracted. Associations between personality factors with PBI care and overprotection scores were examined with regression analyses. Subjects were divided into al  groups and personality factors were subjected to categorical analyses. Schizotypy and Anxiety were significantly predicted by high maternal overprotection and low paternal care. In addition, the Affectionless control group (low care/high overprotection) had higher Schizotypy and Anxiety compared with the Optimal  group (high care/low overprotection). These  further validate sub-optimal  as an important environmental exposure and extend our understanding on the mechanisms by which it increases risk for psychiatric morbidity.

A Qualitative Study of Exemplary Parenting in Competitive Female Youth Team Sport,2019,"This  examined how exemplary youth sport s support their daughters in competitive team sport. Individual interviews were first conducted with eight coaches (three women and five men). Coaches were then invited to nominate exemplary youth sport s. Interviews were subsequently conducted with 10 nominated s (seven mothers and three fathers). Interpretive description methodology ('Thorne, 2016) was used. Results were organized around three categories: being autonomy supportive (reed by the themes of not forcing a direction, sharing goals, fostering independence, and emphasizing effort and having fun), building healthy relationships (trusting and communicating with coaches and supporting the team and club), and coping with emotional demands (assisting before competitions and monitoring emotions during and after competitions). Theoretically, the  highlight the value of autonomy-supportive   and s' emotional intelligence."
"Temperament, Emotion Regulation, and Emotion-Related Parenting: Maternal Emotion Socialization during Early Childhood",2021,"The heuristic model of emotion socialization (Eisenberg et al., 1998; Eisenberg, 2020) identifies predictors of emotion-related  practices, such as 's temperament,  personality and emotion-related beliefs, and cultural factors. Though relations between the temperaments of mothers and their  have been studied, little is known about the interaction of  and  temperaments and how this relates to 's emotional development (Lewis, 2014). We examined how patterns of mother- temperament were related to mothers' emotion-related socialization (e.g., coaching, rejecting). We hypothesized that the relation between these mother- temperament patterns and 's emotion regulation would be mediated by maternal emotion-related socialization. Participants included an ethnically diverse sample of mothers (N = 168) living with young  (4-7 years old; 86 boys, 82 girls). Through a cluster analysis, dyadic mother- temperament patterns were identified. Maternal emotion coaching and emotion rejecting were assessed using a self-report questionnaire of emotion-related socialization. Although maternal emotion coaching was not a significant mediator in models predicting emotion regulation, there was an indirect effect of temperament pattern on 's emotion regulation through mothers' emotion rejecting. Mother- temperament patterns low in negative affectivity predicted lower emotion rejecting, and lower emotion rejecting predicted greater emotion regulation in , even after accounting for covariates. In addition, mother- temperament patterns had a direct effect on 's emotion regulation. This  highlights associations between maternal emotion-related socialization, mother- temperament patterns, and 's emotion regulation."

Adolescents' responses to parental regulation: The role of communication style and self-determination,2019,"This  examined whether adolescents' perceptions and reactions to al regulation were predicted by s' communication  and by adolescents' self-determination. Adolescents (N = 294; M-age = 14.3) reported their self-determination, and then read a hypothetical scenario of al regulation of their academic behavior, whereby s' communication  was either autonomy-supportive or psychologically controlling. Following the scenario, adolescents reported their perceptions of the situation (i.e., autonomy satisfaction, autonomy frustration, legitimacy) and their anticipated responses (i.e., oppositional defiance, negotiation). In response to psychological control, adolescents reported less autonomy satisfaction, more autonomy frustration, less legitimacy, and more defiance. Further, adolescents higher in self-determination reported less autonomy frustration, more legitimacy, less defiance, and more negotiation. Finally, self-determination moderated two effects of communication : adolescents low on self-determination reported less legitimacy and more defiance in response to the psychologically controlling (vs. autonomy-supportive) situation. For adolescents high on self-determination, these between-vignette differences were not significant."
Do Chinese and American Children's Interpretations of Parenting Moderate Links between Perceived Parenting and Child Adjustment?,2012,"Objective. The ers in this  investigated whether Chinese and American 's interpretations of s' coercive authority assertion moderate relations between their self-reported  and adjustment. Associations between  adjustment and s' shaming and critically comparing  to their peers were  investigated. Design. Sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders (M-ages = 11.73, 12.74, and 13.78 years, respectively) residing in Shanghai (n = 150) and Chicago (n = 168) rated possible motivations for coercive authority assertion, indicated whether they approved of it, and reported their s' coercive authority assertion, critical comparison and shaming, as well as their own depression, antisocial behavior, and school effort. Results. Children in both cultures indicated that s practiced coercive authority assertion to benefit their  more than themselves. Yet approval ratings were low. Approval of coercive authority assertion and the -beneficial interpretation moderated relations between s' coercive authority assertion and depression in both cultures. For American , relations between s' coercive authority assertion and both antisocial behavior and school effort were moderated by a social conventional interpretation. Critical comparison and shaming, and s' coercive authority assertion were associated with poorer adjustment in both cultures. Conclusions. Chinese and American  believe s are well-meaning but misguided in their practice of coercive authority assertion. Children's approval and interpretations can moderate s' coercive authority assertion's links to psychosocial and academic functioning. Critical comparison and shaming is  associated with poorer adjustment in both cultures."
Infants' behavioral styles in joint attention situations and parents' socio-economic status,2015,"In this  the eco-cultural model of  (Keller, H. (2007). Cultures of infancy. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum) was applied to the  of joint attention behavior of  from families with different socio-economic status (SES). It was hypothesized that infants' early communication  would differ with SES reflecting more independent or interdependent interactions with their caregivers. It was  hypothesized that infants would use the same types of behaviors whether they have declarative or imperative communication goals. The Early Social Communication Scales (ESCS, Mundy et al., 2003) was administered to 103 typically developing infants of 12 months (approximately half of them siblings of  with autism). A factor analysis, yielding four behavioral factors, namely pointing, eye contact, actions and following points, confirmed the hypothesis that infants use behaviors consistently across situations independent of their communicative intent. MANOVAs (comprising al education and income) revealed that higher SES infants showed actions more frequently in the ESCS whereas lower SES infants followed experimenter's points more frequently. The  are discussed in the context of presumably differing socialization goals for infants and the divergent contribution of al education and income that seem to have additive contribution to some factors (actions, following points) but divergent contributions to others (pointing, eye contact).

Process Evaluation of the Project SHINE Intervention for African American Families: An Integrated Positive Parenting and Peer Monitoring Approach to Health Promotion,2016,"This  describes the process evaluation of Project SHINE, a randomized family-based health promotion intervention that integrated  and peer monitoring for improving sedentary behavior, physical activity, and diet in African American families. Adolescent- dyads (n = 89) were randomized to a 6-week behavioral, positive , and peer monitoring skills intervention or a general health education comparison condition. Process evaluation included observational ratings of fidelity, attendance records, psychosocial measures, and qualitative interviews. Results indicated that the intervention was delivered with high fidelity based on facilitator adherence (>98% of content delivered) and competent use of theoretically based behavior change and positive  skills (100% of ratings >3 on a 1-4 scale). Although only 43% of peers attended the bring a friend session, overall attendance was high (4.39 +/- 1.51 sessions) as was the retention rate (88%). s in the intervention condition reported significant improvements in communication related to adolescents' engagement in health behaviors both on their own and with peers. These findings were supported by qualitative themes related to improvements in family communication and connectedness. This  provides an innovative example of how future family-based health promotion trials can expand their process evaluation approaches by assessing theoretically relevant positive  variables as part of ongoing monitoring."
Bidirectional Relations Between Authoritative Parenting and Adolescents' Prosocial Behaviors,2012,"This  examined the bidirectional relations between authoritative  and adolescents prosocial behavior over a 1-year time period. Data were taken from Time 2 and 3 of the Flourishing Families Project, and included reports from 319 two- families with an adolescent  (M age of  at Time 2 = 12.34, SD = 1.06, 52% girls). Cross-lag analyses supported bidirectional relations between  and prosocial behavior with particular emphasis on the role of the adolescents prosocial behavior on subsequent . Results  varied as a function of the reporter. Discussion focuses on the implications for understanding the multifaceted nature of prosocial development in adolescence."
Title: efficacy of a food parenting intervention for mothers with low income to reduce preschooler's solid fat and added sugar intakes: a randomized controlled trial,2019,"BackgroundFew interventions have shown efficacy to influence key energy balance behaviors during the preschool years.ObjectiveA randomized controlled trial (RCT) was used to evaluate the efficacy of Food, Fun, and Families (FFF), a 12week authoritative food  intervention for mothers with low-income levels, to reduce preschool-aged 's intake of calories from solid fat and added sugar (SoFAS).MethodsMothers were randomly assigned to receive FFF (n=59) or to a delayed treatment control (n=60). The primary outcome was 's daily energy intake from SoFAS at the end of the 12week intervention, controlling for baseline levels, assessed by 24-h dietary recalls. Secondary outcomes included 's daily energy intake, 's BMI z-scores, and meal observations of maternal food  practices targeted in FFF (e.g. providing guided choices).ResultsParticipating mothers were predominantly African American (91%), with 39% educated beyond high school and 66% unemployed. Baseline demographics and  SoFAS intakes did not differ by group. Lost to follow-up was 13% and did not differ between groups. At post-intervention, FFF  consumed similar to 94kcal or 23% less daily energy from SoFAS than  in the control group, adjusting for baseline levels (307.8 (95%CI=274.1, 341.5) kcal vs. 401.9 (95%CI=369.8, 433.9) kcal, FFF vs. control; p<0.001). FFF mothers  displayed a greater number of authoritative  practices when observed post-intervention with their  at a buffet- meal (Wilcoxon z=-2.54, p=0.012). Neither  total daily energy intake nor BMI z-scores differed between groups post-intervention.ConclusionsFindings demonstrate the initial efficacy of an authoritative food  intervention for families with low-income to reduce SoFAS intake in early hood. Additional  is needed to evaluate longer-term effects on diet and growth.Trial registrationRetrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: #NCT03646201."
Do Peers' Parents Matter? A New Link Between Positive Parenting and Adolescent Substance Use,2012,"Objective: Although studies have demonstrated that an adolescent's s and friends both influence adolescent substance use, it is not known whether the  experienced by one's friends  affects one's own use. Drawing on conceptions of shared  and the tenets of coercion theory, we investigated the extent to which three domains of  behaviors (al knowledge, inductive reasoning, and consistent discipline) influenced the alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use of not only their own adolescent  but  of members of their adolescents' friendship groups. Method: Analyses of friendship nominations within each of two successive ninth-grade cohorts in 27 Iowa and Pennsylvania schools (N = 7,439 students, 53.6% female) were used to identify 897 friendship groups. Hierarchical logistic regression models were used to examine prospective associations between 9th-grade friendship group level  behaviors and adolescent self-reported alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use in 10th grade. Results: Adolescent substance use in 10th grade was significantly related to  behaviors of friends' s, after controlling for adolescents' reports of their own substance use and their own s' behaviors at the 9th grade level. These associations were particularly strong for s' knowledge about their  and use of inconsistent discipline strategies. Significant interaction effects indicated that these relationships were strongest when adolescents received positive  at home. Some, but not all, of the main effects of friends' s'  became nonsignificant after friends' substance use in ninth grade was included in the model. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the   in adolescents' friends' homes plays an important role in determining adolescent substance use. Implications of the joint contribution of s and peers for prevention and intervention are discussed. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 73, 423-433, 2012)"
Childhoods under canvas: Campgrounds as spaces of resistance to protective parenting,2015,"Camping is an important activity for many New Zealand families, with half reporting to be regular campers or intending to camp. We explore the role of camping in the lives of 69 families undertaking this activity at five campgrounds over summer in the South Island of New Zealand. We argue that campgrounds are places that encourage 's freedom, sense of adventure and experience of outdoor activities. The social capital evident in campgrounds enables families to adopt a less pressured and hands-off'   which acts as an antidote to the pressured safety consciousness that prevails in their usual daily lives."
Perceived Adverse Parenting in Childhood and Psychological Distress Among Psychotherapy Patients The Mediating Role of Pathogenic Beliefs,2021,"The way people derive inferences from actual adverse experiences plays an important role in the development of psychopathology. This  aims to examine the mediating role of pathogenic beliefs (i.e., emotion-laden, powerful, painful convictions about self and others) on the relation between perceived adverse  behaviors in hood and subsequent adult psychopathology. Participants (mostly Caucasian and heterosexual) were 204 consecutively admitted patients with a range of psychological difficulties, including depression, anxiety, and interpersonal problems, at a low-fee outpatient clinic. Participants completed standard self-report assessments of perceived al , depressive and anxiety symptoms, and a clinically derived measure of pathogenic beliefs. We examined the indirect effects of adverse  on anxiety and depressive symptom severity through pathogenic beliefs. Pathogenic beliefs reflecting the unreliability of others significantly mediated the relationship between adverse  and anxiety symptoms. The other mediation model is consistent with the theory that perceived adverse  contributes to the severity of depressive symptoms through beliefs about not being deserving and other people being unreliable. Within the limitations of the cross-sectional, retrospective, and self-report nature of the data, our  seem to suggest that attending to intermediary subjective beliefs might be important in understanding psychopathology development in the context of hood adversity. Aiming to modify the beliefs in therapy might modify the symptoms. However, this would remain to be demonstrated through formal intervention ."
Parents' response to hypothetical situations of aggression against Ptheir  at school,2013,"The role of families is a key aspect in preventing and coping with peer violence among school . Paradoxically, however, it has been the object of little  or analysis. The aim of this exploratory work, which involved 671 s of 10 to 14 year-old , was to identify, through a cross-cutting design, the option chosen in response to the question What would you do if your  were a victim of peer bullying at school?, and to analyze the association between said response and both personal variables (gender, educational level) and, above all,   (assertive, inhibitionist, punitive or overprotective). Two data collection instruments were used: the PEEF   questionnaire and a situational questionnaire with six possible responses to each situation, divided into three dimensions (non-intervention, resolution within the family circle and search for external support). The analysis of the  suggests that the option chosen may vary depending on the type of bullying or attack in question; external support is almost always sought in cases of cyberbullying, as well as, to a lesser extent, in cases of direct aggression, while the non-intervention option is almost always the one chosen in instances of relational aggression. No significant differences were found in relation to gender, although differences were observed in relation to educational level, and the analysis of standardized residuals indicated that these differences were principally found between the basic and advanced educational level groups. Also, the association between response to aggression and   was only significant for the overprotective and punitive profiles in cases of direct and relational aggression, although not for cyberbullying. The post hoc analyses suggest that the mean for overprotective and punitive profiles was lower amongst those s who chose not to intervene."
Optimism as a mediator of the relation between perceived parental authoritativeness and adjustment among adolescents: Finding the sunny side of the street,2005,"Authoritative  has been associated with positive outcomes for  and adolescents, but less is known about the mechanisms responsible for such effects. Two longitudinal studies examined the hypothesis that the relation between authoritative  and adolescents' adjustment is mediated by adolescents' level of dispositional optimism. In Study 1, university students' perceptions that their s were authoritative predicted higher self-esteem, lower depression, and better university adjustment during the students' transition into, and throughout, university. Importantly, these relations were mediated by students' levels of optimism. In Study 2, high school students' perceptions that their s were authoritative predicted higher self-esteem and lower depression six years later when they were young adults, and these relations again were mediated by students' level of dispositional optimism."
Parenting practices and oral impact on daily performance in southern Brazil,,"Objectives To explore the relationship between s' practices and the oral health-related quality of life of  according to the 's point of view. Methods It is a cross-sectional  with all  (response rate 75.6 percent, n = 329) from fourth grade of Elementary School to the third grade of High School in 2016 in a small city of southern Brazil. Oral health related quality of life was measured using the oral impact on daily performances (OIDP) using the prevalence of any impact as outcome (OIDP score > 0). Seven  practices were evaluated by the inventory of  Styles for both father and mother. Logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the association of each  practice with OIDP score > 0, and adjusted by sex, age, family equivalent income, mother and father's educational level. Results About 55.3 percent of the  had at least one impact on daily performances. Respectively, the  practices with the highest and lowest percentage for both s' risk behavior was physical abuse (28.8 percent) and negative monitoring (7.8 percent), while families in which both s' risk behavior for negligence was 14.7 percent. In the adjusted models, families in which both s' risk behavior on negligence [odds ratio (OR) = 2.74, 95% confidence intervals (95%CI): 11.27-6.23] and physical abuse (OR = 2.16, 95%CI: 1.13-4.19) and (lack of) positive monitoring (OR = 2.99, 95%CI: 1.32-7.40) had a greater impact on daily life compared to those in which no s' had risk behavior. Conclusions Having any impact on OIDP was associated with negligence, physical abuse, and lack of monitoring among  and adolescents."
Perceived inadequate care and excessive overprotection during hood are associated with greater risk of sleep disturbance in adulthood: the Hisayama Study,2016,"Background: Sleep disturbance and poor sleep quality are major health problems worldwide. One potential risk factor for the development and maintenance of sleep disturbance is the   experienced during hood. However, its role in sleep disturbance in adulthood has not yet been estimated. This Japanese population  was done to clarify the relation between the   care and overprotection during hood and sleep disturbance in adulthood. Methods: A total of 702 community-dwelling Japanese residents aged >= 40 years were assessed in 2011 for their perceptions of the   of their s by use of the al Bonding Instrument (PBI) and for sleep disturbance by use of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The odds ratio (OR) for sleep disturbance (a global PSQI score > 5) was calculated using a logistic regression model. Results: The prevalence of sleep disturbance was 29 %. After adjusting for sociodemographic, life, and physical factors in a comparison with the optimal   (high care and low overprotection), the ORs for sleep disturbance by men were significantly higher for low paternal care, by 2.49 times (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 21-5.09), and for high overprotection, by 2.40 times (95 % CI: 1.19-4.85), while the ORs were not significant for low maternal care and high overprotection. For women the only significant factor was high maternal overprotection, by 1.62 times (95 % CI: 1.05-2.52), while the ORs were not significant for low maternal care, low paternal care and high paternal overprotection. The association remained significant for high paternal overprotection for men after additionally controlling for depression. Conclusions: This  suggests that  , especially inadequate care and excessive overprotection during hood, is related to sleep disturbance in adulthood and that the association is much more significant for s of the same sex as the ."
"Concurrent Associations between Parenting Dimensions, Callous-Unemotional Traits, and Externalizing Behaviour Problems during Adolescence",2021,"Considering that externalising behaviour problems are one of the most prominent psychopathologies, it is important to investigate the interplay of individual and environmental factors that are associated with such behaviours. Although previous literature revealed associations between  dimensions, callous-unemotional traits, and externalising behaviour problems, only a few studies examined these simultaneously during adolescence. The current  investigated the association between al warmth/coercion and aggression/rule-breaking behaviour, and to determine whether these associations are mediated by callous-unemotional trait dimensions. A sample of 462 adolescents completed a questionnaire assessing callous-unemotional traits and externalising behaviour problems, and their s completed a   questionnaire. A path model revealed that al warmth had a negative direct effect on the dimensions callousness and uncaring, which in turn had a positive effect on aggression and rule-breaking behaviour. al coercion had a positive direct effect on unemotionality, which was not associated with aggression and rule-breaking behaviour. Only al warmth had an indirect effect onto externalising behaviour problems via callous-unemotional traits. Our findings demonstrate that even during adolescence,  remains an important factor for callous-unemotional traits and externalising behaviour problems. The unique differences between the  dimensions and the callous-unemotional trait dimensions have interesting implications for future ."
Adult separation anxiety and unsettled infant behavior: Associations with adverse parenting during hood and insecure adult attachment,2015,"Objective: This  examined the prevalence and correlates of Adult Separation Anxiety Disorder (ASAD) and Adult Separation Anxiety (ASA) symptoms in a sample of first-time mothers with an unsettled infant during the first postpartum year. Methods: Eighty-three primiparous women admitted to a residential  infant program participated in a structured clinical interview for DSM-IV diagnosis and questionnaires assessing ASA symptoms, adult attachment and hood  experiences. Nurses recorded infant behavior using 24-hour charts. Results: The prevalence of ASAD in this sample was 19.3% and women with ASAD were, on average, more likely to be diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorders, report aversive  experiences during hood and show adult attachment  insecurity. Both ASAD and ASA symptoms were predicted by adult attachment anxiety, and ASAD was associated with unsettled infant behavior. Attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance mediated relations between al over-control and ASAD diagnosis, and between al abuse and ASAD diagnosis. Attachment anxiety mediated the relation between al over-control and ASA symptoms, and attachment avoidance mediated the relations of al over-control and al abuse with ASA symptoms. Conclusions: This  highlights the prevalence of ASAD among first time mothers experiencing early  difficulties and the roles of hood  experiences and adult attachment  in the development of the disorder. This points to the importance of introducing universal screening for ASAD in postnatal settings, and for the development of targeted interventions. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Peer Victimization and Harsh Parenting Predict Cognitive Diatheses for Depression in Children and Adolescents,2016,"The current  examined peer victimization and harsh  as longitudinal predictors of broadband and narrowband cognitions associated with the etiology of depression in  and adolescents. The sample consisted of 214 elementary and middle school students. At the start of the , their average age was 12.2 years (SD=1.0). The sex ratio was 112 girls to 102 boys. The sample was ethnically diverse (58.9% Caucasian, 34.1% African American, 10.7% Hispanic, 3.3% Asian, and 5.2% other). Children and their s completed measures of peer victimization and harsh . At two waves 1 year apart,   completed questionnaire measures of negative and positive broadband cognitive  (e.g., personal failure, global self-worth) and narrowband self-perceptions (e.g., perceived social threat, social acceptance). Every Wave 2 cognitive variable was predicted by peer victimization or harsh  or both, even after controlling for a Wave 1 measure of the same cognitive variable. Peer victimization more consistently predicted narrowband social/interpersonal cognitions, whereas harsh  more consistently predicted broadband positive and negative cognitions. Furthermore, controlling for positive and negative self-cognitions eliminated a statistically significant effect of harsh  and peer victimization on depressive symptoms. Support emerged for the social learning of negative self-cognitions. Support  emerged for negative self-cognitions as a mediator of depressive symptoms. Implications for theory and practice are discussed."
Perceptions of parental bonding in freebase cocaine users versus non-illicit drug users,2014,"Background & objectives: Evidence has suggested that   have peculiar characteristics in families with drug-related issues. This  was undertaken to investigate the perception of crack (smoke cocaine) users and non-users about al bonding quality regarding care and control in Brazil. Methods: A total of 198 hospitalized crack users and 104 users of any non-illicit drug were assessed using the al Bonding Instrument (PBI), the sixth version of the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) and Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Results: Adjusted logistic regression analysis showed that crack users were more likely (ORadj = 9.68; 95% CI: 2.82, 33.20) to perceive neglectful mothers, as well as more likely (ORadj = 4.71, 95% CI: 2.17, 10.22) to perceive controlling and affectionless fathers in comparison with non-illicit drug users who were more likely to perceive optimal . Interpretation & conclusions: Our findings indicate that the perception of neglectful mothers and affectionless controlling fathers may be associated with the tendency of the  to be less resilient when facing stressful events, leading them to a greater risk to use crack."
The impact of parental-rearing styles on irritable bowel syndrome in adolescents: A school-based study,2014,"Background and AimA strong association between family function and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been observed. al rearing , as a comprehensive mark for family function, may provide new clues to the etiology of IBS. This  aimed to explore which dimensions of al rearing  were risk factors or protective factors for IBS in adolescents. MethodsTwo thousand three hundred twenty adolescents were recruited from one middle school and one high school randomly selected from Jiangan District (an urban district in Wuhan City). Data were collected using two Chinese versions of validated self-report questionnaires including the Rome III diagnostic criteria for pediatric IBS and the Egna Minnen Betraffande Uppfostran: One's Memories of Upbringing for perceived al rearing . ResultsNinety-six subjects diagnosed as pediatric IBS were compared with 1618 controls. The IBS patients reported less both paternal and maternal emotional warmth (all P<0.01) and more both paternal and maternal punishment, overinterference, rejection, and overprotection (only for father) (all P<0.01) than the controls. Furthermore, the IBS patients had higher total scores of al rearing  (all P<0.001) than the controls. With univariate logistic regression, standardized regression coefficients and odds ratios of al rearing variables were calculated. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that paternal rejection (P=0.001) and maternal overinterference (P=0.002) were independent risk factors for IBS in adolescents. Conclusionsal emotional warmth is a protective factor for IBS in adolescents and al punishment, overinterference, rejection, and overprotection are risk factors for IBS in adolescents."
Adolescent Perception of Maternal Practices in Portugal and Spain: Similarities and Differences,2020,"The aim of this  was to compare  in two southern European countries, Spain and Portugal, according to adolescent perceptions from a situated perspective. A total of 445 Portuguese (58.88%) and Spanish (41.12%) adolescents completed a questionnaire about maternal practices and provided socio-demographic information. Portuguese and Spanish mothers were more responsive than coercive in controlling adolescents' compliance and non-compliance situations. Spanish mothers scolded, revoked privileges, and punished physically more often than Portuguese mothers, who used dialogue more often. Multivariate analysis showed three groups of  practices. Portuguese mothers were reed mainly in the Indulgent group (81.70%), and Spanish mothers in the Authoritative group (74.40%), whereas the third group (Neglectful) was independent of the country of origin. These  support the theory that  and family intervention should recognize cultural aspects in order to grasp the  process."
The Impact of Parents' Expectations on Parenting Behaviour: An Experimental Investigation,2008,Over-involved  is commonly hypothesized to be it risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders in hood. This   may  from al attempts to prevent  distress based on expectations that the  will be unable to cope in a challenging Situation. Naturalistic Studies are limited in their ability to disentangle the overlapping contribution of  and  factors in driving al behaviours. To overcome this difficulty. an experimental  was conducted in which al expectations of  distress were Manipulated and the effects on  behaviour and  mood were assessed. Fifty-two  (aged 7 - 11 years) and their primary ;caregiver participated. s were allocated to either a positive or a negative expectation group. Observations were made of the  and their s interacting whilst completing a difficult anagram task. s given negative expectations of their 's response displayed higher levels of involvement. No differences were found on indices of  mood and behaviour and possible explanations for this are considered. The findings are consistent With Suggestions that increased al involvement may be a natural reaction to enhanced perceptions of  vulnerability and an attempt to avoid  distress.
The Long-Term Impact of Family Routines and Parental Knowledge on Alcohol Use and Health Behaviors: Results from a 14 Year Follow-Up,2017,"Previous  has found significant associations between family routines (e.g., time shared and family meals),  characteristics, and later adolescent health behaviors. In general, greater family interactions, al monitoring, and more optimal   have been associated with less alcohol use during adolescence. We expanded upon this work by examining effects of family and  characteristics on alcohol use and health behaviors during young adulthood. We  followed tenets of the Contextual Model of  by examining the moderating effects of   on the associations between /family practices and outcomes. Data came from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997. A total of 5419 youth were surveyed at 12-14 years of age, and then annually for the next 14 years; 4565 were surveyed at a 10 year follow-up and 4539 were examined at the 14 year follow-up (84% retention). Multivariate models, controlling for sex and race/ethnicity, indicated that, in general, family routines and al knowledge in early adolescence were associated with healthier behaviors at both the 10-year and 14-follow-ups. Results  showed that the protective effects of al knowledge and family routines were strongest in families characterized by and authoritative  ."
"Early post-partum adjustment and admission to parenting services in Victoria, Australia after assisted conception",2009,"BACKGROUND: Higher rates of admission to residential early  services (REPSs) after assisted conception compared with spontaneous conception have been reported. The aim of this  was to characterize early post-partum psychological functioning and the rate of, and risks factors for, admission to REPSs in women conceiving with assisted reproductive technology (ART) in Australia. METHODS: A consecutive cohort of women who had conceived through ART was recruited systematically in early pregnancy. At 3 months post-partum, participants completed postal questionnaires which included a new measure of the degree of difficulty involved in conceiving, the Burden of Infertility and Treatment (BIT) scale. RESULTS: Of 166 women who participated, 8% had already been admitted to a REPS within 3 months, which is a higher rate compared with other women in the first 12 months (5%). Compared with community samples of new mothers, there was no difference in rate of depression. A higher proportion reported dysregulated infant behaviours (P < 0.0001) and a smaller proportion was breast feeding exclusively (P < 0.0001). Greater difficulty conceiving (higher BIT score) was associated with lower maternal confidence. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical care of the increasing group of women who conceive with ART should include explicit assessment of early postpartum psychological functioning and early intervention if difficulties in managing infant behaviour are reported."
Parents' Perceptions of Smartphone Use and Parenting Practices,2019,"Technology use in one's life has generally explored why people use certain technologies, how they use technology, and the effect of such usage on our personal relationships. To date, however, few studies have explored the use of using smartphones and its effect on  practices. The   sought to understand s' perceptions of their smartphone use's effect on their  and  practices. Grounded in a social constructionism perspective, interviews were conducted with 12 s inquiring about their smartphone usage. Five themes emerged: (1) Disengagement, (2) Concern for Future, (3) Change in Social Norms, (4) Boundaries, and (5) Cognitive Dissonance. These findings indicate some remarkable effects al smartphone use is having in the lives of  participants. Results and implications are discussed."
"AUTHORITATIVE, AUTHORITARIAN, AND PERMISSIVE PARENTING PRACTICES - DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW MEASURE",1995,"A 133-item  questionnaire was completed by 1251 s of preschool and school-age . Items in this measure were reduced using principal axes factor analyses followed by varimax rotation. Three global  dimensions emerged consistent with Baumrind's authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive typologies. Internal consistency reliability was assessed with Cronbach alpha and additional items were deleted. A 62-item instrument was retained, and the global  dimensions were subsequently analyzed to assess their internal structures using principal axes factor analyses followed by oblique rotation. For each of the three global dimensions a number of specific factors were identified."
Remembered parenting style and psychological well-being in young adults whose parents had experienced early  loss,2006,"Background. Pre-, peri-, or postnatal loss can have devastating consequences for bereaved families. This  explored the long-term sequelae of these experiences for the young adult siblings' psychological well-being and the perceived quality of  received during participants' first 16 years of life. Methods. A bereaved group of young adult sibilings was compared to a non-bereaved group on the  Bonding Instrument, the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale and the Mental Health Index-5. Results. The loss group reported their mothers, but not their fathers, to have been more protective/control ling than non-bereaved participants. No differences between the loss group and the comparison group were found for al care, their own mental health or self-esteem. Those participants whose siblings died during the peri/post-natal period perceived their s as more controlling than the miscarriage group as well as the non-bereaved group. Higher protection scores were evident among those born subsequent to the loss than those who were born before. Lower levels of protection were associated with better mental health across all groups. In the nonbereaved group lower levels of protection were associated with better self-esteem, but in the bereaved group a different even opposite pattern was shown. Conclusions. Young adults who lost a sibling when they themselves were under 5 recall their mothers as more protective/controlling than non-bereaved groups, although they do not report less care nor differ in mental health nor self-esteem. Higher levels of al protection/control were found where the  was born subsequent to loss and for peri/post-natal loss rather than miscarriage. While high protection was associated with poorer mental health regardless of loss this may not be necessarily disadvantageous to the 's self-esteem. Differences with regard to  gender were found."
The physical activity parenting practices (PAPP) item Bank: a psychometrically validated tool for improving the measurement of physical activity parenting practices of parents of 5-12-year-old ,2020,"Background Many tools have been developed to measure physical activity  practices (PAPP). Currently, there is little standardization on how PAPP constructs are operationalized for 5-12 year-old . Given this lack of consistency our team have started the process of standardizing the measurement of PAPP by developing an item bank which was conceptually informed by 24 experts from 6 countries. Purpose The purpose of this paper is to  the psychometric properties of the PAPP item bank using the expert-informed PAPP conceptual framework. Methods A sample (N = 626) of Canadian s completed the PAPP item bank (100 items measuring 12 constructs). Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFA), confirmatory bi-factor item analyses, and Item Response Modeling (IRM) were used to assess the structural validity of scores derived from the PAPP item bank. Differential Item Functioning (DIF) and Differential Response Functioning (DRF) were used to determine whether the PAPP items are invariant by  sex, ethnicity of , and household income. Finally, Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) simulations were used to determine the efficiency of the item bank - this involved ascertaining whether each construct can be assessed with fewer items. Results The PAPP expert-informed conceptual framework was mainly supported by the CFA analyses. Notable changes included: a) collapsing smaller constructs into one general construct (modeling, co-participation, and monitoring constructs were collapsed into a construct assessing nondirective support); or b) splitting a construct into two smaller constructs (restrict for safety reason construct was split into indoor physical activity restriction and allowance for unsupervised outside physical activity). While the CFA analyses supported the structural validity of 11 constructs, the bi-factor item analyses and IRM analyses supported collapsing correlated constructs into more general constructs. These analyses further reduced the number of constructs measured by the PAPP item bank to nine constructs (65 items - reliability ranging from .79 to .94). As seven of the PAPP constructs had reliability greater than .80, CAT simulations further reduced the number of items to 31 items. Conclusion Overall, the PAPP item bank has excellent psychometric properties and provides an efficient way to assess PAPP."
What connections between Marital conflict and Parenting Quality? Evidence from parent's gender in spillover effects,2015,"The spillover hypothesis posits that negative emotions and behavioral patterns in marital conflicts influence  quality and 's adjustment, through increasing of harsh and incoherent discipline and diminished involvement and affection. Moreover conflicts focused on rearing issues are particularly distressing for  with often show emotional and behavioral problems. The aim of the  was to explore gender differences in the links between marital conflicts (destructive and constructive tactics, rearing disagreement) and - relationships, in order to verify if there are different pathways for fathers and mothers in spillover effects. 110 s ( aged 6-12 years) completed the Styles of Conflict Scale (marital conflict ), the  Problem Checklist (disagreements about rearing), the Alabama  Questionnaire ( practices), and the  Stress Index. The links between conflict tactics and  practices change in function of 's gender. Mothers refer more frequent rearing disagreements and increasing in punishment; furthermore - in line with the spillover hypothesis - attack and violence tactics are associated negatively with positive  (involvement and warmth). For fathers compromise, avoidance and attack correlate positively with effective  (more involvement, affection and consistency disciplinary). A spillover effect, that is, an extension of marital tensions in the relationship with their  with reduced quality of , seems to manifest only for women. These findings, if confirmed by other studies, would be relevant from an clinical point of view to understand how paternal and maternal  mediate the effects of the marital disharmony on 's adjustment. Over the past decades the assumption of a systemic perspective (Belsky, 1981) has led developmental and clinical psychologists to investigate the effects of the quality of marriage on  adjustment (Holland & McElwain, 2013; Stroud, Durbin, Wilson & Mendelsohn, 2011). Studies describe that a harmonious marriage is generally associated with sensitive and warm  (Belsky, Crnic, & Gable, 1995), whereas disagreement between the spouses, when  in open conflicts, mutual accusations and hostility (both verbal and physical), is associated with a wide variety of problematic outcomes in  such as withdrawal or anxiety, low social competence and self-esteem, non-compliance or aggressive behaviors (Davies, Martin, Cicchetti, 2012). Troxel e Matthews (2004) proposed that marital conflict, often leading to divorce and family dissolution, influences 's adjustment though changes in the quality of - relationships. This model assumes that the stresses associated with marital conflict compromise the family life both directly (as  observe inter-al hostility and anger, fill insecure attachment and self-blame), or indirectly through the negative changes in - relationships. Specifically, effects of marital conflicts are mediated by , that is, the emotional quality and the concrete behaviors (or practices) s show to . These changes, named as spillover effects, describe how the negative emotions and behavioral patterns that characterize marital system will bleed into - dyad (Enger, 1988)."
Factors associated with mothers' obesity stigma and young 's weight stereotypes,2011,"s and  hold negative attitudes about obesity, but little is known about individual differences in obesity stigma. The current  examined authoritarian  , beliefs about the controllability of weight and fear of fat in relation to mothers' dislike of overweight individuals. Factors related to 's weight stereotypes were  investigated. Forty-nine mothers and  (43% girls) participated. Mothers showed more dislike and blame toward adults who are overweight than  who are overweight; s were most often blamed for 's weight status. Authoritarian  and beliefs about controllability were related to mothers' anti-fat attitudes, but fear of fat was not. However, mothers' fear of fat was the best predictor of 's negative stereotypes toward overweight peers. The current  provides some preliminary insight into the role of mothers in 's attitudes about weight. Examining individual difference factors is  useful in planning targeted interventions to lessen obesity stigma. Published by Elsevier Inc."
"Caregiver distress, coping and parenting styles in cases of hood encephalitis",2007,"This  s an exploration of the impact of hood encephalitis on al mood, coping and disciplinary strategies. Thirty six s of  aged between 10 and 17 years were recruited. They were split into groups of recent and remote cases (within or beyond 7 years). Group comparison revealed that neurobehavioural consequences of hood encephalitis appear to persist over time. Higher levels of behavioural symptoms consistent with dysexecutive disorder were associated with greater al distress. s remain distressed despite reporting proactive profiles of coping. There was an indication that severity of dysexecutive disorder was asscociated with less use of proactive al management strategies. Support for s, in particular focused on effective management of dysexecutive problems, is recommended."

Non-exposure parenting increases risk of bullying behavior in junior high school students,2016,"BACKGROUND Bullying behavior is one of many behavioral and disciplinary problems among school students, which has a wide impact on youth, families, schools, and communities.  and the role of s as good educators (exposure) can prevent mental, emotional and behavioral disorders caused by bullying. The aim of this  was to determine the role of self-esteem and family factors on bullying behavior in junior high schools students. METHODS A cross-sectional  was conducted including 1324 junior high school students of Penjaringan village, North Jakarta. Respondents filled out questionnaires on demographics (age, gender, economic status, educational level), Rosenberg self-esteem questionnaire, strength and difficulties questionnaire, Olweus bullying questionnaire, Hamilton scale for depression,  , and family adaptability and cohesion scales III. Simple and multivariate logistic regression tests were used to analyze the data. RESULTS Respondents consisted of 53.5% females and 46.5% males, with an age range of 13-16 years. A total of 45% was involved in bullying (victims, perpetrators, and victims and perpetrators). Gender, self-esteem, family relationships, and  were significantly associated with bullying role (p<0.05). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that self-esteem (odds ratio=23.89; 95% CI:7.899-12.990) and non-exposure  (odds ratio=39.11; 95% CI:2.455-8.210) were significantly associated with bullying behavior. CONCLUSIONS Non-exposure  was the most relevant risk factor of bullying behavior. Low self-esteem increases the risk of bullying behavior. These findings suggest the need of timely bullying prevention and intervention programs that should have a special focus on families of primary high school students."
Is Mindful Parenting a Mechanism that Links Parents' and Children's Tendency to Experience Negative Affect to Overprotective and Supportive Behaviors?,2021,"Objectives The main goal of this  is to investigate the mediating role of mindful  dimensions in the relationship between s' and 's tendency to experience negative affect (i.e., s' neuroticism and 's negative reactivity) and s' overprotection and supportive behaviors. Methods A sample of 399 s (84.2% mothers) of  aged between 6 and 13 years completed self-report questionnaires assessing neuroticism, 's negative reactivity, mindful , al overprotection, and support of 's coping behaviors. A path model was tested through structural equation modeling. Results s' and 's tendency to experience negative affect were shown to be associated with lower levels of all mindful  dimensions. s' neuroticism was shown to be directly associated with greater overprotection. In addition, s' neuroticism and 's negative reactivity were both shown to be indirectly associated with lower levels of overprotection and supportive behaviors through lower levels of compassion towards the  and of emotional awareness of the . In contrast, s' neuroticism and 's negative reactivity were indirectly associated with a greater overprotection through lower levels of nonjudgmental acceptance of al functioning. Conclusions This  provides insight into how the temperamental tendency to experience stronger and more frequent negative emotions can contribute to al overprotection and the al support of 's coping behaviors. Mindful  dimensions seem to shape the way neuroticism and 's reactivity are associated with overprotection and supportive behaviors."

Parenting among Hispanic and Anglo-American mothers with young ,2000,"The authors examined  practices and developmental expectations among 38 Hispanic and 38 Anglo-American mothers living in the United States. Mothers of  3 to 5 years of age completed the  Behavior Checklist (R. A. Fox, 1991), a 100-item measure of s' developmental expectations, discipline, and nurturing practices. In addition, the authors appraised the Hispanic mothers' acculturation and selected them for participation if their scores on an acculturation scale indicated (a) that their life was predominantly Hispanic and (b) that they had not been assimilated into the dominant culture. The 2 ethnic groups were  divided by socioeconomic status (SES). There were significant main effects for ethnicity and SES on the discipline and nurturing scores but not on the expectations scores. The Hispanic and higher SES mothers reported higher discipline and lower nurturing scores than did the Anglo-American and lower SES mothers. An unexpected finding was the tendency for higher SES Hispanic mothers to report more frequent use of discipline than the other 3 groups."
STYLES OF PARENT-CHILD INTERACTION AND MORAL REASONING IN ADOLESCENCE,1993,"The purpose of this  was to test the prediction that adolescents of authoritative s exhibit a greater preference for postconventional moral reasoning than do adolescents of permissive or authoritarian s. Seventy-four grade 10 and 12 students (n = 74) and first-year university students (n = 67) completed Rest's Defining Issues Test and an adapted version of Schaefer's Child Report of al Behavior Inventory.  , defined by combinations of scores on the three  dimensions, was clearly related to the use of postconventional reasoning: adolescents of authoritative s used the most postconventional reasoning, followed by adolescents of permissive s and those of authoritarian s, respectively. It is argued that these  support the extension of the concept of moral atmosphere beyond its current use in school and classroom settings to include its application in the context of individual families."
"Binge drinking in adolescents: Correlations with temperament, peers, and parenting styles",2008,"During the last years, binge drinking has become common among German adolescents. Novelty seeking, delinquency, and peer behavior as well as al monitoring are considered as risk factors. However, little is known about their interplay with regard to binge drinking. This article s data of 333 15-year-olds from the Mannheim Study of Risk Children, a prospective longitudinal  of a birth cohort. About one third of the sample had already engaged in binge drinking. Consistent with expectations, among these were more adolescents with high levels of novelty seeking, deviant peer contacts, and delinquency. Independent of these factors, al monitoring had a protective effect on levels of heavy alcohol use. The impact of novelty seeking became insignificant after controlling for the other variables. It is concluded, that deviant peer affiliation and delinquency are significant risk factors for binge drinking, while al monitoring acts as a protective factor, both directly and indirectly."

Since the development of this diagnostic tool (Parker et al., Brit. J. Med. Psycho. 1979; 52: 1-10), a number of validation studies have been done in various cultures. The aim of the   was to translate the measure into Bangla and validate in Bangladeshi culture. A total of 200 adolescents participated in the . Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of the data from 191 participants (who provided complete responses) identified a two-factor (Care and Overprotection) structure of the PBI with 17 items. The two factors together explained 44.18% of the total variance. The factors showed moderate to very high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.863 for Care; 0.622 for Overprotection), and very strong convergent and discriminant validity as evident by their correlations with the measures of cognitive distortions and antisocial behaviors. In line with the original tool we defined four types of  , such as Affectionate constraint, Affectionless control, Optimal , and Neglectful .

Parenting Stress and Coping Strategies in Mothers of Children Receiving Early Intervention Services,2017,"The relationship between coping strategies of mothers of  receiving early intervention services and  stress was studied. A total of 144 mothers from 17 early intervention centers located in the Valencian Community, Spain, participated of the . Mother's mean age was 35.6 years (SD = 4.10) and 's mean age was 2.71 years (SD = 1.21). Mothers'  stress level was measured using the  Stress Index-SF (PSI-SF) and their coping strategies were evaluated using the Adult Coping Response Inventory (CRI-A). We proposed two structural equation models to predict total  stress and its factors in relationship to 's and mother's sociodemografic variables, and mediated by mother's coping strategies. Mothers' education level and  diagnosis had a direct impact on the three PSI-SF factors. Type of disorder and Cognitive Avoidance were positively and significantly (p < .05) related to the Emotional Discharge coping strategy, explaining a 20.9% of the variance. On the other hand, mothers' educational level and 's type of disorder, directly, and coping strategies, in the form of mediator or directly, have a relationship with the dimensions of maternal stress. Both models show similar  although the second model supports the existence of a latent stress factor that is explained by the three stress factors. The authors concluded that mothers of  with especial needs could potencially benefit from early intervention programs that provide supports to help them to incorporate aproach coping  to their coping strategies."
Parenting practices and internalizing and externalizing problems in Spanish adolescents,2011," practices and internalizing and externalizing problems in Spanish adolescents.

FAMILIAL PREDICTORS OF SMOKING IN ADOLESCENTS; A COMPARISON OF SMOKERS AND NON-SMOKERS,2021,"Adolescence stage is filled with enormous changes and challenges. At this stage, adolescents are not mentally mature so they failed to adjust to the changes of their life and are at greater risk of developing smoking habit. Many psychosocial factors contribute to adolescents' smoking, among them family role is prominent. So, the  correlational  aimed to highlight the familial predictors of smoking in adolescents. It was hypothesized that  , lack of - communication, less al monitoring, s and sibling smoking would be related to adolescents smoking. Data was collected from 150 adolescents (smokers: 70, non-smokers: 80) throughconvenient sampling technique. al bonding instrument and al monitoring questionnaire were used. Binary Logistic regression revealed less al care and father's monitoring, lack of mother- communication and siblings' smoking as significant predictors of smoking. The  implications are discussed with its application in health, social and counseling psychology."
Is always the family the main risk factor in Child to Parent Violence?,2017,"Many of the programs carried out in order to intervene with Child to  Violence (CPV) are directed mainly towards victims. The fact that family is the primary agent of socialization contributes to trying to find the reasons behind  and adolescents' behavioral disorders in this field. Thus, many authors see CPV as a ''high-risk'' situation within the family in which minors are not properly treated, where there are degraded contexts, inadequate  , blurred boundaries, hostility and neglect, a pathological profile of the s, conflicting relationships between the partner and disregard for the  who become considered as victims and tormentors at the same time. A large amount of  seems to support this point of view, but, is it true in most cases? Or, in other words: is always the family the main risk factor in Child to  Violence?"
Family of origin characteristics as predictors of perfectionism,2009,"This  investigated perceptions of family of origin (al  and family system characteristics) as predictors of dysfunctional and functional perfectionism (as measured by the Khawaja and Armstrong shortened Australian version of the Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale) in a sample of 264 Australian first-year Psychology students at University of Sydney. Regression analyses showed that dysfunctional perfectionism was predicted by extreme family enmeshment and by   that were highly authoritarian and high on psychological control. Functional perfectionism was  predicted by extreme family enmeshment and authoritarian  , but not by high al psychological control. An implication of these findings for counselling and remedial education programs for students working with dysfunctional perfectionist tendencies is that such programs need to include consideration of the possible influence of unhelpful controlling family processes that appear to be associated with the development of dysfunctional perfectionism."

Social-demographic variables, marital conflict, family stress,  , social support, and quality and structure of family environment were studied. The sample consisted of 76 families composed by s and  aged from 6 to 10 years. Five different types of family structure were considered in the . Results showed that high level of marital conflict and family stress, authoritarian or permissive  practices and large family's conflictive networks were risk factors for antisocial behaviour. However, antisocial behaviour did not show significant relationship with the size of family's social support network, the quantity and quality of the stimulation that  received at home, the type of family structure, and social-demographic variables such as s' age or economical and educative level. A multiple regression analysis showed that all family predictors explained about 43% of the variability in hood antisocial behaviour."
The In/Visibility of Mothering Against the Norm in Francophone Contexts: Private and Public Discourses in the Mediation of Natural Parenting,2015,"Mothers who engage in natural , an unconventional  of  in Francophone contexts, use online media, and in particular online forums, as a source of information, as a place for discussing the variety of authentic maternal experiences, and as a virtual site of community building around shared practices, values, and worldviews. This contribution looks at the ways in which twenty-first-century online mediation participates in the blurring of private/public boundaries in the domain of  and how this affects s who mother outside of the norm, following environmentalist worldviews. It  investigates the association of natural  and religion, and the articulations between public and private discourses about institutional motherhood and mothers' experiences."
"Linking Parenting and Social Competence in School-Aged Boys and Girls: Differential Socialization, Diathesis-Stress, or Differential Susceptibility?",2019,"Girls generally demonstrate superior skill levels in social competence compared to boys. The exact relations of  with these gender differences are currently unclear. Gender differences may occur due to exposure to different  strategies (differential socialization model) or due to a different impact of similar  strategies for boys and girls (differential susceptibility and diathesis-stress model). Objective: In this  we assessed both hypotheses using a multi-method multi-informant approach. We investigated (1) to what extent different  strategies mediate the relation between gender and social competence and (2) whether gender and age moderate the relation between  strategies and social competence. Design:  strategies were observed during home visits and social competence was assessed using  and teacher questionnaires and performance-based neurocognitive tasks (N = 98, aged 4 to 8). Results: (1)  strategies did not mediate the relation between gender and social competence. (2) Gender moderated the association between al questioning  and 's level of social competence: s asking fewer questions was associated with poorer social cognitive skills in boys only. al supportive presence and intrusiveness were related to aspects of social competence irrespective of gender. Age moderated the relation between  and aspects of social competence, though in various (unexpected) directions. Conclusion: Our findings do not support the differential socialization hypothesis and provide partial evidence for a diathesis-stress model as an explanation for al influence on gender differences in social competence."
Understanding and Addressing the Needs of Parenting Educators: A Focus Group Analysis,2013,"Research suggests that  behaviors are consistently related to  well-being and amendable to change via intervention. However,  educators have been historically underresourced. The goals of the   were to (a) better understand the challenges  educators face in their efforts to assist s and (b) explore the ways a university-based center might address these challenges. We conducted 10 focus groups with  educators from various regions in Tennessee. Five themes were identified related to common challenges and needs: access to s, training and materials, policy-related advocacy, operational resources, and networking opportunities. Additionally, a sixth category of unique or creative recommendations for supporting  education was extracted. Results offer insights for both outreach-oriented university professionals and family service providers."
"Relationships Between Positive Parenting, Overparenting, Grit, and Academic Success",2019,"Grit is a trait that describes the drive to succeed above and beyond natural intelligence. While grit has been associated with positive academic outcomes, few ers have investigated the predictors of grit, such as . We examined the influence of  on grit and academic success in 226 college students. Results indicated that over and al acceptance and involvement were significantly related to grit and grit was found to have a significant predictive relationship with academic success. Further, grit mediated the relationship between over and academic success."
When mothers have serious mental health problems: parenting as a proximal mediator,2005,"Maternal mental health (MMH) problems are associated with lack of confidence in one's , overly lax or too harsh discipline, and  academic underperformance. We asked if  mediates the effect of MMH problems on academic outcomes even among mothers with serious mental illness (n = 164). Structural equation analyses show a significant association between MMH problems and permissive (lack of  confidence, lack of follow through)  and verbal hostility as well as worse academic outcomes (school recorded grades, teacher reported behaviour). Permissive  completely mediated the direct effect of MMH on academic outcomes. Further analyses showed that the mediation effect was attributed to a single component of permissive -lack of  confidence. (c) 2004 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

Stability and change in parenting beliefs in first-time mothers from the pre- to postnatal period,2001,"A total of 103 prospective first-time mothers completed measures of  beliefs, depressive symptomatology, personality, social support and attachment  at 20 weeks prepartum (T1), and were asked to complete various measures again at 6 months postnatally (T2). There were significant changes in  beliefs in an adaptive direction, with mean scores for 'nurturance' and 'knowledge of social learning theory' increasing, and scores for 'restrictiveness', 'authoritarianism', 'punitiveness' and 'role reversal' decreasing. Scores on each belief measure at T2 were predicted by the corresponding score at T1, with other measures at T1 explaining further variance for particular beliefs at T2. The implications of these findings for those supporting first-time mothers and directions for future  are discussed."
The role of maternal communication style in adolescents' motivation to change alcohol use: A vignette-based study,2017,"Aim: The  aimed to explore the association between maternal communication  [controlling vs. autonomy-supportive (AS)] and adolescents' motivation to change alcohol use, as well as the intervening role of autonomy and relatedness needs frustration and coping responses (i.e. oppositional defiance and submission) in this association. Methods: A vignette-based  was conducted with 134 adolescents (M-age = 17.46 years) randomly assigned to a controlling or an AS condition, describing a maternal reaction to an alcohol use episode. Then, adolescents reported upon their experienced need frustration, their coping responses and their motivation to change alcohol use. Findings: Results indicated that adolescents in the controlling condition felt more frustrated in their needs for autonomy and relatedness that adolescents confronted with the AS reaction. When adolescents experienced frustration regarding their autonomy need, they coped by submitting to the maternal request, which in turn predicted greater motivation to change alcohol use. However, when they experienced frustration regarding their relatedness need, they engaged in oppositional defiance to the request, which in turn predicted lower motivation to change alcohol use. Conclusions: These  suggest that controlling maternal communication  relates to two distinct processes that have opposing effects on adolescents' motivation to change alcohol use."
"The typological approach in  and family psychology: A review of theory, methods, and ",2003,"The purpose of this paper was to review the theoretical underpinnings, major concepts, and methods of the typological approach. It was argued that the typological approach offers a systematic, empirically rigorous and reliable way to synthesize the nomothetic variable-centered approach with the idiographic case-centered approach. Recent advances in cluster analysis validation make it a promising method for uncovering natural typologies. This paper  reviewed findings from personality and family studies that have revealed 3 prototypical personalities and  : Adjusted/Authoritative, Overcontrolled/Authoritarian, and Undercontrolled/Permissive. These prototypes are theorized to be synonymous with attractor basins in psychological state space. The connection between family types and personality structure as well as future directions of typological  were  discussed."
How do Families of Adolescents with Anorexia Nervosa Coordinate Parenting?,2020,"Current guidelines for the treatment of anorexia nervosa (AN) in  and adolescents underline the central role of s' involvement for positive therapy outcomes. However, little is known about the influence of cooperation between the al couple on family functioning and the maintenance of food symptoms in the anorexic . This exploratory  reports preliminary data on co and family functioning in families of adolescents with AN and their associations with food symptoms, in terms of body mass index (BMI). The sample consisted of 24 families of adolescents with AN, who had been admitted to a specialized tertiary level 's hospital. Family coordination was evaluating using the Lausanne Trilogue Play (LTP) and co  was measured using the Co and Family Rating System (CFRS). Significant differences were found for different LTP functions (Friedman's chi-square = 52.188; p < 0.001) and phases (Friedman's chi-square = 10.277; p < 0.05). Families showed low coordination (66.7%) and a prevalence of dysfunctional co- , including -at-center (41.2%) and excluding (35.3%) . Families' ability to participate in the third phase of the LTP was positively associated with BMI (rho = 0.558, p < 0.01). The co relationship impacts the maintenance of eating pathology, though this association requires further investigation. Moreover, in line with clinical observations, the  show a prevalence of unexpressed al conflict in the  sample. The LTP seems to be a more accurate observational tool for this kind of family dynamic than the CFRS, because it includes covert competitive and conflictual behaviors."
RECALL OF EARLY EXPERIENCE AND THE REPRESSIVE COPING STYLE,1994,"We investigated recall of early experience and the repressive coping  by testing hypotheses concerning restricted access to negative hood memories and eliciting accounts of quality of  received. Repressors free recalled fewer negative hood memories than nonrepressors, and the age of first negative memory for repressors was older both in free recall and cued recall. Repressors  took longer to retrieve negative hood memories but not positive memories. Repressors' accounts of their hoods were more likely to be characterized by paternal antipathy and indifference, and they were less likely to report an emotionally or physically close relationship with their fathers."
Catechol-O-Methyltransferase Genotypes and Parenting Influence on Long-Term Executive Functioning After Moderate to Severe Early Childhood Traumatic Brain Injury: An Exploratory Study,2017,"Objectives: To examine catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) rs4680 genotypes as moderators of the effects of   on postinjury changes in  behavior ratings of executive dysfunction following moderate to severe early hood traumatic brain injury. Setting: Research was conducted in an outpatient setting. Participants: Participants included  admitted to hospital with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (n = 55) or orthopedic injuries (n = 70) between ages 3 and 7 years. Design: Prospective cohort followed over 7 years postinjury. Main Measures:  Practices Questionnaire and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning obtained at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months, and 3.5 and 6.8 years postinjury. DNA was collected from saliva samples, purified using the Oragene (DNA Genotek, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) OG-500 self-collection tubes, and analyzed using TaqMan (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts) assay protocols to identify the COMT rs4680 polymorphism. Results: Linear mixed models revealed a significant genotype x   x time interaction (F = 5.72, P =.02), which suggested that the adverse effects of authoritarian  on postinjury development of executive functioning were buffered by the presence of the COMT AA genotype (lower enzyme activity, higher dopamine levels). There were no significant associations of executive functioning with the interaction between genotype and authoritative or permissive  ratings. Conclusion: The lower activity COMT rs4680 genotype may buffer the negative effect of authoritarian  on long-term executive functioning following injury in early hood. The findings provide preliminary evidence for associations of   with executive dysfunction in  and for a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors as contributors to decreases in these problems after traumatic injuries in . Further investigation is warranted to understand the interplay among genetic and environmental factors related to recovery after traumatic brain injury in ."
Relationship between Goodness-of-Fit for Mother-Preschool Child and Parenting Stress in Mother,2009,"Purpose: This  was done to identify the relationship between goodness-of-fit for mother-preschool  dyads and  stress experienced by the mother. Methods: Study participants were 500 mothers who had  aged 3 to 5 who attended one of ten kindergartens or infant schools in M City or B City. Descriptive statistics and Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated using the SPSS program. Results: Comparison of goodness-of-fit scores for mother-preschool  dyad according to the characteristics of the participants, showed a significant difference according to 's age, gender, and birth order, mothers education and occupation, father's age and education, family income, and the chief caregiver in the family. There was a positive correlation between goodness-of-fit scores for mother- dyad and  stress scores for mothers. Conclusion: The findings of the  indicate a need to identify differences between 's behavioral problems and   according to the degree of discord in the mother- temperaments. It is  necessary to develop and apply nursing programs to promote harmonizing of temperaments, programs in which the characteristics of the  and the mother are considered."
Past Experience with Maternal Parenting among Mothers of Pre-School Children and Maternal Acceptance-Rejection: The Moderating Role of the Care-Giving System,2017,"The theory of al acceptance-rejection and Bowlbys' attachment theory were used as the framework for examining how the   experienced by the mothers in hood is related to acceptance-rejection of their pre-school  in the , as well as for examining the moderating role of the care-giving system. The sample consisted of 150 Israeli mothers, who were asked to complete self-report questionnaires relating to: maternal acceptance-rejection; experience with maternal  in hood; care-giving system; and personal variables. The findings indicate that maltreatment experienced in hood contributes to the mother's acceptance-rejection of her  in the , and that an avoidant care-giving  moderates the relationship between permissive maternal  in hood and the mother's acceptance of her  in the . The  highlights the importance of the care-giving system as a moderating factor, as well as the role of therapeutic intervention aimed at 'breaking' inter-generational transmission in cases where hood experiences with maternal  were less positive."
"Is the Stepping Stones/Triple P-Parenting Program a Reasonable, Additional Intervention in the Treatment of Children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder?",2015,"The effectiveness of the  Program Stepping Stones/Triple P for  diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was evaluated. The s of 13  (nine boys, four girls), aged between four and twelve years (M = 6.7, SD = 2.16) took part in the . Training sessions took place over 14 weeks and comprised eight meetings of two hours each. s' ratings (pre- and post treatment, as well as six months after treatment) referred to 's co-morbid symptoms as well as to  . Additionally, s rated pre- and post treatment autistic symptoms and al stress. A few s were included as a waiting list control group.

Direct Observations of Parenting and Real-Time Negative Affect Among Adolescent Smokers and Nonsmokers,2013,"This longitudinal  examined how observations of al general communication  and control with their adolescents predicted changes in negative affect over time for adolescent smokers and nonsmokers. Participants were 9th- and 10th-grade adolescents (N=111; 56.8% female) who had all experimented with cigarettes and were thus at risk for continued smoking and escalation; 36% of these adolescents (n=40) had smoked in the past month at baseline and were considered smokers in the  analyses. Adolescents participated separately with mothers and fathers in observed -adolescent problem-solving discussions to assess  at baseline. Adolescent negative affect was assessed at baseline, 6 months, and 24 months via ecological momentary assessment. Among both smoking and nonsmoking adolescents, escalating negative affect significantly increased risk for future smoking. Higher quality maternal and paternal communication predicted a decline in negative affect over 1.5 years for adolescent smokers but was not related to negative affect for nonsmokers. Controlling maternal, but not paternal,  predicted escalation in negative affect for all adolescents. Findings suggest that reducing negative affect among experimenting youth can reduce risk for smoking escalation. Therefore, family-based prevention efforts for adolescent smoking escalation might consider al general communication  and control as intervention targets. However, adolescent smoking status and  gender may moderate these effects."
Psychometric Properties of a German Translation of the Parental Bonding Instrument,2022,"Zusammenfassung Das elterliche Erziehungsverhalten beeinflusst sowohl die Entwicklung eines Kindes als auch die Entstehung und Behandlung psychischer Storungen. Das al Bonding Instrument (PBI; Parker, Tupling & Brown, 1979) ist ein bekanntes Instrument zur retrospektiven Erfassung des elterlichen Erziehungsstils. Bisher existiert jedoch keine ausreichend validierte deutsche Version. Daher entwickelten wir eine sprachlich aktuelle, deutsche ubersetzung des PBI (PBI-dt) und untersuchten in einer Onlinestudie anhand einer deutschsprachigen Stichprobe (N=791) die psychometrischen Eigenschaften des PBI-dt hinsichtlich Item- und Reliabilitatskennwerten, Konstrukt- und Kriteriumsvaliditat sowie der faktoriellen Struktur. Die Analysen ergaben gute Item- und Reliabilitatskennwerte (alpha =0,86-0,95). Die Skalen des PBI korrelierten in den erwarteten Richtungen mit den Skalen des Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Au ss erdem wurden signifikante Unterschiede im berichteten elterlichen Erziehungsstil zwischen Personen mit und ohne psychische Erkrankung sowie zwischen ubergewichtigen und normalgewichtigen Personen gefunden. Diese Ergebnisse weisen auf das Vorliegen von hoher Konstrukt- und Kriteriumsvaliditat hin. Konfirmatorische Faktorenanalysen ergaben in allen untersuchten Fitindizes eine akzeptable Modellanpassungsgute sowohl fur das 2-Faktorenmodell von Parker et al.

Abstract  behavior affects a 's development as well as the etiology and treatment of mental disorders. The al Bonding Instrument (PBI; Parker, Tupling & Brown, 1979) is a well-known measurement tool to retrospectively assess  . Yet, no sufficiently validated German version exists to date. Therefore, we developed an updated translation of the German PBI version (PBI-dt) and analyzed its psychometric properties in an online survey based on a sample of n=791 German-speaking participants with a focus on item and reliability characteristics, construct and criterion validity as well as factorial structure of the PBI-dt. Our  indicated good item characteristics and reliability (alpha =0.86-0.95). Correlations between PBI and CTQ-SF (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire Short Form) scales were in line with the literature. Significant differences in the reported   were found between people with and without mental illness as well as between normal-weight and overweight people. These  indicated the presence of good construct and criterion validity. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated an acceptable model fit for all fit indices in the original 2-factor model of Parker et al.

Adolescents' experiences with upbringing and life styles,2005,In the center of this contribution is the connection between experiences with upbringing and life  during adolescence. Data basis are the statements of 608 adolescents between the ages of 15 and 18 years. Four  of upbringing were ascertained using a factor analysis. These  were analyzed in connection with the four expressive life  which in turn had been generated doing a cluster analysis. We were able to ascertain that an empathic upbringing is mostly connected to the highly cultural life  whereas the opposite upbringing in form of sanctioning is highly connected to the opposite hedonisitc life . This life  shows strong associations with a delinquent and health hazardous behavior. The findings are discussed in regard to the effects of al upbringing taking social structural differentiations into account.
Screen media exposure in pre-school  in Turkey: the relation with temperament and the role of parental attitudes,2021,"Background. Electronic media have become an important element in the lives of modern . Devices like televisions, smartphones and tablets are widely used by some s in order to manage hyperactive, stubborn and impulsive  who need high-intensity stimuli. Consequently, a 's temperament and al attitudes affect the duration and frequency of 3-7-year-old 's screen (television-smartphone-internet) use. Based on this information, the objective of the   was to evaluate the relation between screen media exposure, the 's temperament and al attitudes in 3-7-year-old . Methods. The participants of this  were 210  of 3 to 7 years of age. Rothbart's Child Behavior List was used to assess temperament; the  Attitude Research Instrument was used to determine the al attitudes. Screen media exposure assessment questionnaire, which included questions about the age the  started using the TV, smartphone and/or internet, and the duration of their daily usage, were filled in with the 's s. Results. It was found that the increase in activity level, approach and discomfort was negatively correlated to the age the  started watching television, while shyness was positively related to the same phenomenon. The scores of the discomfort temperament subscale had a direct relation to the duration of watching television. Background television is negatively related to attention, inhibitory control, and perceptual sensitivity. Dependency, marital conflict and strictness and authoritarianism parameters were found to be positively related to the duration of playing with a smartphone. Also, in this  we found that negative temperament characteristics adversely affected screen media exposure and poor   worsen this relationship. Conclusions. Both temperament and   affect screen media exposure. In addition, it was understood that    affect the relation between temperament and screen exposure. al information programs on this subject can eliminate the lack of information related to early screen media exposure in preschool ."
Reinforcement sensitivity and maternal style as predictors of psychopathology,2007,"This  examined the effect of reinforcement sensitivity and adverse  on adult psychopathology. One hundred eighty-one undergraduates completed a battery of self-report scales measuring Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) sensitivity, Behavioral Approach System (BAS) sensitivity, maternal care, maternal overprotection, depression, anxiety, psychopathy, and substance abuse. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to test the hypotheses. Higher BIS and lower care scores predicted anxiety and depression; lower BAS, higher BIS, and lower care scores predicted anhedonic depression. Higher BAS and lower BIS scores predicted drug abuse and primary psychopathy; higher BAS, lower BIS, and lower care scores predicted alcohol abuse. Higher BAS and lower care scores predicted secondary psychopathy. Exposure to low maternal care predicted anxiety, depression, alcohol abuse, and secondary psychopathy after partialling out BIS and BAS sensitivity. In addition, some support was found for the hypothesis that BIS sensitivity mediates the effect of maternal overprotection on anxiety. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Effects of the home environment on school-aged 's sleep,2005,"Study Objective: Examine the relationship between the sleep behavior of elementary school-aged  and characteristics of the home environment. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of  participating in a cohort . Setting: Cleveland Children's Sleep and Health Study, an ethnically mixed, urban, community-based cohort. Participants: Four hundred forty-nine  (50% girls, 46% African-American) aged 8 to 11 years. Measurements and Results: Sleep and health data were obtained from a -completed 7-day sleep journal and caregiver-completed health and sleep questionnaire. Home-environment predictors were Middle-Childhood Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (MC-HOME) total score and Encouragement of Maturity and Physical Environment subscale scores. Sleep outcomes were mean nightly sleep duration, night-to-night variation in sleep duration, and bedtime of 11 PM or later. Adjusted analyses showed that higher Encouragement of Maturity subscale scores were associated with longer sleep duration (P < .05) and decreased odds of a bedtime at 11 PM or later (odds ratio = .74, 95% confidence interval, .58-.95). In girls, higher Encouragement of Maturity scores were  associated with decreased nightly variation in mean sleep duration (P < .001). Increases in total MC-HOME score were associated with increased mean sleep duration among African-American  only (P < .05). Conclusion: Collectively,  indicate that a   encouraging social maturity in  is linked to healthier sleep patterns."
"Adolescent fathers' parenting stress, social support, and involvement with infants",2007,"The   examined the relationship between concurrent measures of adolescent fathers'  stress, social support, and fathers' care-giving involvement with the 3-month-old infant, controlling for fathers' prenatal involvement. The  sample consisted of 50 teenage father-mother dyads. Findings from multivariate regression revealed that fathers'  stress was significantly and negatively related to fathers' care giving as perceived by both fathers and mothers. The relationship between support for father involvement provided by the young man's s and father reported care-giving involvement approached significance. Social support from both teenagers' s buffered the negative influence of  stress on fathers' involvement with the baby. Policy and intervention implications are discussed."

The stability and validity of early adolescents' reports of parenting constructs,1998,"The stability and validity of early adolescents' reports of 6  constructs were examined: - conflict, positive family relations, al monitoring, s' rule making, consistent enforcement of rules, and use of positive reinforcement. Hierarchical confirmatory factor analysis (CFA; H. W. Marsh & D. Hocevar, 1988) on questionnaire data from 3 quarterly assessments of 174 5th-7th grade youth was used to test a multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) model containing 6  constructs as trait factors and 3 assessment occasions as method factors. Youths' reports of these  constructs were stable over time, and the CFA approach to MTMM data demonstrated convergent and discriminant validity of the constructs. Each  construct was significantly correlated with youths' reports of deviant peer associations, antisocial behavior, and substance use, providing evidence of criterion validity."
A vocabulary of motives: Understanding how parents define quality time,2007,"Although discussions of  refer to quality time, s' views of quality time have not been explored. Using the Sloan 500 Family Study, this article examines how 220 s from 110 dual- families define the spending quality time with their families and finds 3 distinct views: Structured-planning s saw it as planned family activities, -centered s emphasized heart-to-heart talks with their , and time-intensive s believed that all the time they spent with their families was quality time. Mothers and fathers both valued quality time, but, particularly when s within a household disagreed, mothers more often described having a more active  role and assumed greater responsibility for quality time, reflecting a gendered division of  within the home."

"Relation between psychotic symptoms, parental care and hood trauma in severe mental disorders",2017,"A relation between different types of al care, trauma in hood and psychotic symptoms in adulthood has been proposed. The nature of this association is not clear and if it is more related to psychotic disorders per se or to a cluster of symptoms such as positive psychotic symptoms remains undefined. We have analysed the presence of hood trauma using the CTQ scale and types of al care using the PBI scale in three groups of subjects: borderline personality disorder patients (n=36), first psychotic episode patients (n=61) and healthy controls (n=173). Positive psychotic symptomatology was assessed with the CAPE scale. General linear models were used to  the relation between positive psychotic symptomatology and variables of interest. BPD patients had the highest rate of any kind of trauma, followed by FEP patients. We found a positive relationship between psychotic symptomatology and the existence of trauma in hood in all groups. Moreover, an affectionless control rearing  was directly associated with the existence of trauma. Furthermore, subjects with trauma ed less probability of having an optimal   in hood. The relation between psychotic symptoms and trauma remained statistically significant after adjusting for other variables including al rearing . There seems to be a link between trauma in hood and psychotic symptomatology across different populations independently of psychiatric diagnosis. Taking into account that there is an association between trauma and psychosis and that trauma is a modifiable factor, clinicians should pay special attention to these facts."
Explanation of dyadic adjustment model based on components of schema modes and coping styles in blended and normal families,2019,"Aims: The lack of adjustment of couples is not only devastating families but  ruin family relationships in second marriage. The aim of the  was to explain the couples' adjustment model based on the components of the schematic modes and coping  among blended and normal families. Materials and Methods: The  method was descriptive from type of correlation. The statistical population consisted of normal and blended families of Mazandaran. Samples were selected through stratified random sampling (313 normal and 250 blended). To gather the data, the Spaniel Marital Adjustment Scale (1976), schematic questionnaire (1999), and the Ultra Extreme Compensation Questionnaire (1994) were used. To analyze the data, path analysis was used. Results: The findings showed that in both families, hood and dysfunctional modes predict couple adjustment in a negative way (P < 0.05), and dysfunctional  mode has negative significant effect on couples adjustment in normal and not significant in blended families. The healthy adult mode has positive significant effect in normal and nonsignificant effect on the blended couples. Conclusions: Based on the findings, especially in the blended families that is the weakness of healthy adult modes and the emotional changes of couples in the components of the schematic modes suggest a decline in the compatibility of the spouses."

Findings: Participants reported that, beyond the impact of the injury on the , TBI affects the entire family. s need to adjust to and manage their 's difficulties and can  experience significant emotional distress, relationship discord and burden of care, further adding to the challenges of the  role. s can feel isolated and the importance of empowerment, support and information was emphasized. Coping  of disengagement and avoidance were often reported, despite acknowledgement that these were not beneficial. Conclusions:  interventions may provide essential support for s in adjusting to and managing their 's difficulties and the efficacy of existing programmes needs evaluation. Addressing  emotional adjustment and coping strategies is vital following paediatric TBI, given the impact on  well-being and the potential negative effects on  outcomes through reduced  effectiveness. Group programmes may enable connection and support."
Separation anxiety and gender variance in a community sample of ,2019,"In clinical  and retrospective adult samples, hood gender variance (GV; i.e., cross-gender behaviour) has been associated with separation anxiety (SA; i.e., distress related to separation from attachment figures) in males. This  examined GV and SA in a nonclinical sample of 892 boys and 933 girls aged 6-12 years via -reports. al factors (i.e.,  , - relationship, willingness to serve as an attachment figure, attitudes towards gender stereotypes in ) were examined as potential moderators. GV predicted SA in boys, even when statistically controlling for general psychopathology and demographic variables. Authoritative , closeness in the - relationship, willingness to serve as an attachment figure, and liberal attitudes towards gender stereotypes in  moderated the association between GV and SA in both boys and girls. Thus, SA may be a unique internalizing problem related to GV in boys in nonclinical samples and influenced by a variety of al factors."
Raising Happy Children Who Succeed in School: Lessons From China and the United States,2014,"Chinese  outperform their American counterparts in the academic arena. Although many aspects of Chinese and American 's environments likely contribute to this achievement gap, a key aspect may be learning-related  (e.g., assisting  with homework and responding to 's performance).

Influence of family type and parenting behaviours on teenage sexual behaviour and conceptions,2006,"Background: Longitudinal data were used to explore relations between teenage pregnancy, sexual behaviour, and family type. The  examined whether students from lone  and/or teenage mother initiated families more commonly report sex, lack of contraception at first sex, and/or conceptions by age 15/16, and whether such associations can be explained by low al strictness, difficult - communication, and/or low al input into sex education. Up to date longitudinal UK  on family influences on conceptions is lacking, as is longitudinal  on family influences on sexual behaviour. No previous studies have comprehensively examined effects of  behaviours. Unlike previous , this  tested theories suggesting that  deficits among lone  and teenage initiated families increase risk of teenage pregnancy among their . Methods: Secondary analysis of data from a trial of sex education. Results: Girls and boys from lone  families or having mothers who were teenagers when they were born were more likely to report sex but not lack of contraception at first sex by age 15/16. Girls and boys with mothers having them as teenagers, and boys but not girls from lone  families, were more likely to report being involved in conceptions by age 15/16. Only the association between teenage mother family and girls' conceptions was reduced by adjusting for a  behaviour measure. Conclusions: Students from lone  families or having mothers who were teenagers when they were born are more likely to report early sexual debut and conceptions by age 15/16, but this is not generally explained by  ."

Development of logical reasoning in the context of parental style and test anxiety,1998,"The development of reasoning during adolescence was examined, and the relationship of al  and test anxiety to reasoning performance was explored. Participants were 120 students, 40 each in the sixth, tenth, and twelfth grades, classified into authoritative or nonauthoritative and high or low test-anxiety groups. They were administered 10 deductive reasoning problems. As predicted, tenth and twelfth graders demonstrated significantly more advanced reasoning than did sixth graders. As expected, authoritative  was related to more advanced reasoning performance and lower test anxiety than was nonauthoritative . Further, low test anxiety was related to more advanced reasoning performance than was high test anxiety. Results are discussed in terms of contextual factors in logical reasoning."

Potentially Violent Disagreements and Parenting Stress Among American Indian/Alaska Native Families: Analysis Across Seven States,2008,"Objectives We examined the prevalence and correlates of potentially violent disagreements among AI/AN families with . Methods We conducted a cross-sectional examination of data from the 2003 National Survey of Children's Health, limited to seven states for which AI/AN race/ethnicity was available in public use files (Alaska, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and South Dakota). Disagreements were classified based on how the family deals with conflict. If disagreements involved actual (hitting) or symbolic (throwing) violence, even rarely, the household was categorized as having potentially violent disagreements,'' with heated argument and shouting being classified as heated disagreement.''  stress and demographic characteristics were included as potential correlates. Results Potentially violent disagreements were reported by 8.4% of AI/AN and 8.4% of white families. The odds for potentially violent disagreements were markedly higher among s reporting high  stress, in both AI/AN (OR 7.20; CI 3.45-15.00) and white (3.59, CI 2.71-4.75)families. High  stress had similar effects on the odds for heated discussion. Having a  with special health care needs was associated with  stress. Conclusions Questions about disagreement  may be useful as potential screens for domestic violence."
An exploratory factor analysis of the Parenting strategies for Eating and physical Activity Scale (PEAS) for use in Hispanic mothers of adolescent and preadolescent daughters with overweight,2015,"Existing measures of feeding and physical activity  strategies have not been validated for use among Hispanic mothers of adolescent and preadolescent daughters with overweight. The purpose of this  was to investigate the factor structure of the  strategies for Eating and Activity Scale (PEAS) among 134 Hispanic mothers (M-age = 38.81, SD +/- 6.34) of adolescent and preadolescent daughters with overweight. Results from this exploratory  revealed that a three-factor structure (Limit Setting, Monitoring, and Discipline) and a 13-item revised PEAS measure might be better suited for use with this population. The revised Limit Setting, Monitoring, Discipline, and total subscales had good reliability (alpha = 0.89, alpha = 0.88, alpha = 0.90, and alpha = 0.87, respectively) and the subscale inter-item correlations were strong. To assess the concurrent validity, the revised PEAS subscales were correlated with both subscales of the Behavioral Strategies to Reduce Fat and Increase Fiber ( Report) in a subset of the sample (n = 78). The Monitoring and Discipline subscales were found to be correlated with the Behavioral Strategies to Reduce Fat (r = .36 and r = .27, p < .05, respectively) and Increase Fiber (r = .40 and r = .35, p < .01, respectively) subscales. However, the revised PEAS Limit Setting subscale was not correlated with either Reduce Fat or Increase Fiber strategy. Taken together, these  indicated some degree of concurrent validity. Results from this  should be cross-validated using confirmatory factor analysis approaches. Published by Elsevier Ltd."

No  has compared  behaviors of  with anxiety disorders (ADS) and ADHD, which is important to understand the common or specific role of  in both disorders, and  to inform interventions including s. Methods: We compared the presence of paternal and maternal behaviors of autonomy granting, control, and rejection in youths with AD (n = 16; M-age = 11.63, SD = 2.96) to the presence of these behaviors in youth with ADHD (n =14; M-age = 10.64, SD = 2.65) and in community sample (CS) youths (n = 24; M-age =11.4, SD = 2.64) using aggregated , -about-self, and about-partner report. al anxiety was  assessed. Results: Fathers of youths with ADs were less controlling than fathers of youths with ADHD and CS fathers. Fathers of youths with ADHD were more rejecting of their  than fathers of  with ADs and CS fathers. With respect to maternal behaviors, no differences between the three groups occurred. No group differences were found in al anxiety. Conclusion: Results provide little evidence for the assumed controlling and tack of autonomy encouragement  of s of  with ADs. This  points to the importance of involving fathers in the treatment of youth ADHD. Irrespective of whether paternal dysfunctional behaviors are involved in the development of ADHD or are a consequence of ADHD, it is likely that such behaviors negatively contribute to the therapy course and pace and should be targeted during treatment.

FACTORS AFFECTING PATHOLOGICAL INTERNET USE AMONG CHINESE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS,2017,"High rates and serious negative consequences of pathological Internet use (PIU) have been reported among young adults; thus, we aimed to identify the impacts of demographic, socioenvironmental, and psychological factors on PIU in this population. We conducted a cross-sectional  with 501 Chinese university students, who completed Young's Internet Addiction Test, the Egna Minnen Betraffande Uppfostran, the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, and the Coping Style Questionnaire. Results showed that age, gender, father's refusal or denying, and father's overprotectiveness had positive impacts on PIU, whereas the rural/urban nature of the area in which participants grew up and mother's emotional warmth and understanding had negative impacts on PIU. Further, greater psychoticism and use of the avoidant coping  were related to higher PIU, whereas greater use of the self-blaming coping  was associated with lower PIU. These factors should be considered when developing interventions aimed at decreasing PIU."

Father's parenting and father- relationship among  and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,2013,"Objective: Western literature documents impaired father- interactions in addition to strong evidence of impaired mother- interactions in  with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the  process of fathers and their engagement in the Asian family with  with ADHD remain unexplored. The authors compared fathering and father- relationships between  with ADHD and those without ADHD and identified the correlates of these paternal measures. Methods: Fathering and father- relationships were compared between 296  with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 229  without ADHD in Taiwan. All  participants and their s received psychiatric interviews for the diagnosis of ADHD and other psychiatric disorders of the , and their fathers were assessed for ADHD, anxiety and depressive symptoms. Both the fathers and  reported on the father's  , father- interactions, behavioral problems at home, and perceived family support. Results: The  showed that  with ADHD received less affection/care and more overprotection and authoritarian control from their fathers. They had less active interactions with their fathers, more severe behavioral problems at home; and perceived less family support than  without ADHD. Correlates for impaired father- interactions included hood ADHD symptoms, any comorbidity, age at assessment, and the father's neurotic personality and depressive symptoms. In addition, the  reported more negatively on fathering and father- interactions than the fathers. Conclusions: Our findings suggest the negative impacts of ADHD on the father's   and father- interactions. Clinical interventions aimed at improving father- interactions warrant more attention.

The effect of post-traumatic stress disorder on refugees' parenting and their 's mental health: a cohort study,2018,"Background Children and adolescents, who account for most of the world's refugees, have an increased prevalence of psychological disorders. The mental health of refugee  is often associated with the severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in their caregivers. Despite the potential for refugee caregivers' PTSD to affect  mental health, little evidence exists concerning the underlying mechanisms of this association. This  tested the effect of refugee caregivers' previous trauma and levels of ongoing stressors on current PTSD, and in turn how this influences  behaviour and consequent  psychological health. Methods This cohort  recruited participants from the Building a New Life in Australia , a population-based prospective cohort  of refugees admitted to 11 sites in Australia between October, 2013, and February, 2014. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older and the principal or secondary applicant (ie, the refugee applicant within a migrating family unit) for a humanitarian visa awarded between May, 2013, and December, 2013. Primary caregiver PTSD and postmigration difficulties were assessed at Wave 1 (in 2013), and caregiver PTSD was reassessed at Wave 2 (in 2014). At Wave 3, between October, 2015, and February, 2016, primary caregivers repeated measures of trauma history, postmigration difficulties, probable PTSD, and harsh and warm  , and completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire for their . We used path analysis to investigate temporal patterns in PTSD, trauma history, postmigration stressors,  , and 's psychological difficulties. Findings The current data comprised 411 primary caregivers who provided responses in relation to at least one  (660 ). 394 primary caregivers with 639  had data on independent variables and were included in the final model. Path analyses revealed that caregivers' trauma history and postmigration difficulties were associated with greater subsequent PTSD, which in turn was associated with greater harsh  and in turn, higher levels of  conduct problems (ss=0.049, p=0.0214), hyperactivity (ss=0.044, p=0.0241), emotional symptoms (ss=0.041, p=0.0218), and peer problems (ss=0.007, p=0.047). There was  a direct path from primary caregiver PTSD to 's emotional problems (ss=0.144, p=0.0001). Interpretation PTSD in refugees is associated with harsh  , leading to adverse effects on their 's mental health. Programmes to enhance refugee 's mental health should account for PTSD in s and caregivers, and the  behaviours that these  are exposed to. Copyright (c) 2018 The Author(s).

The Dialectics of Parenting: Changes in the Interplay of Maternal Behaviors during Early and Middle Childhood,2017," and  relationships continuously evolve, part of an ongoing dialectic that derives from developmental changes in both  and . The focus of this  is on changes in the strength of association among four types of  behaviors considered important for 's development: supportive presence, respect for autonomy, stimulation, and hostility. Mother- interaction was observed for 1229 - dyads at 36 months, 54 months, 1st grade, 3rd grade, and 5th grade using similar observational paradigms. The association between respect for autonomy and supportive presence was strong at age three and continued to be strong over time. The association between respect for autonomy and stimulation was modest but  showed little change from age three to 5th grade. Respect for autonomy was negatively associated with maternal hostility, but the relation was complex. It was stronger at 54 months than 36 months but then became weaker through time. Supportive presence showed a moderate relation with stimulation at age 3 but the association became weaker over time. Supportive presence showed an expected negative association with hostility, a relation that changed little over time. The relation between hostility and stimulation  became weaker over time. In effect, there appears to be a shifting pattern of relations between maternal behaviors during early and middle hood, one that reflects an evolving dialectic in the mother- relationship."

The sample consisted of 118 mothers of mentally handicapped and 121 mothers of healthy . The validation of MBI in a sample of the mothers of mentally handicapped and healthy  yieled two factors of emotional burnout and personal accomplishment. The  of one way ANOVAs indicated that there were significant differences between the emotional burnout levels and submissive coping  levels of the two group of mothers, the mothers of mentally handicapped  having higher scores than the mothers of the healthy  on two factors of MBI and the submissive coping  factor of the Coping Style Scale. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that personal accomplishment factor of MBI, cognitive-affective factor of the Stress Self-Assessment Checklist, submissive  factor of the Coping Style Scale and seeking for social support factor of the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support Scale were the best predictors of burnout in the mothers of the mentally handicapped . Hierarchical regression analysis  revealed that the family factor of the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support Scale, cognitive-affective factor of the Stress Self-Assessment Checklist, helpless  factor of the Coping Style Scale, physiological symptom factor of the Stress Self-Assessment Checklist and confidence in self factor of the Coping Style Scale were the best predictors of burnout in the mothers of the healthy .

Implications of these findings for the use of Triple P with families of Chinese descent are discussed."
An instrument for measuring parents' perceptions of conflict style with adolescents: The When We Disagree scales,2010,"The aim of this  was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the  version of oWhen We Disagreeo scales (WWD), measuring the  of conflict (aggression and compromise) within -adolescent relationship. Differences according to adolescent gender and age, and according to perspective (description of self and description of the adolescent) were assessed. Concurrent validity was established by correlations with family communication and  self-efficacy. Participants include 302 mother-father dyads with adolescent  (13 and 15 years old; total n=604).

The development of a refined measure of dysfunctional parenting and assessment of its relevance in patients with affective disorders,1997,"Background. The al Bonding Instrument (PBI) measures fundamental  dimensions (care and over-protection), but does not directly assess abusive . Methods. We describe the development of the Measure of  Style (the MOPS), comprising refined PBI scales assessing al indifference and over-control, as well as a scale assessing al abuse. Results. We examine psychometric properties of the MOPS, while several analyses build to the concurrent validity of the abuse scale as an experiential measure. We examine the extent to which both the PBI and the MOPS scales showed specificity of dysfunctional  to the non-melancholic depressive subtype, and across a range of anxiety disorders. Non-melancholic depressed patients returned anomalous  scale scores (compared to melancholic subjects), but only when such subtyping decisions were clinician-generated. Those receiving DSM-III-R lifetime anxiety diagnoses of panic disorder and of social phobia returned higher PBI protection and MOPS over-control scores than non-anxious subjects, while differences were not established for those with generalized anxiety disorder or obsessive compulsive disorder. Conclusions. We consider the likely utility of the MOPS scale and note the module capacity of separate MOPS and PBI scales, which allow a set of options for assessing perceived  characteristics."
Autonomy-related Parenting Profiles and their Effects on Adolescents' Academic and Psychological Development: A Longitudinal Person-oriented Analysis,,"The important role of  is widely acknowledged, but as most studies have understood and examined it as a stable attribute (e.g.,  ), the stability of and changes in  are less well understood. Using longitudinal person-oriented approaches (i.e., latent profile analyses and latent transition analyses), this  aimed to examine the stability of and changes in autonomy-related  profiles and their effects on adolescents' academic and psychological development. Four autonomy-related dimensions (i.e., autonomy support, warmth, psychological control, conditional regard) were chosen to identify  profiles on the basis of Self-Determination Theory. Using five-year longitudinal data from 789 German secondary school students (50.06% female, M-age at T1 = 10.82 years, age span = 10-17), four autonomy-related  profiles were found: Supportive (similar to 17%), Controlling (similar to 31%), Unsupportive-Uncontrolling (similar to 17%), and Limited Supportive (similar to 35%). The  suggest that the Supportive profile contributes to adolescents' positive academic and psychological development, whereas the Controlling profile, which thwarts autonomy development, exacerbates the development of psychopathology, and impairs academic achievement. More importantly, the Limited Supportive profile is as maladaptive as the Unsupportive-Uncontrolling profile. Regarding  profiles' stability and changes, the  showed that about half of each profile stayed in the same group. Overall, it could be observed that s became more supportive and less controlling over time. However, the findings  indicate that  profiles are less stable than expected and can still change during early-to-mid adolescence."

Parental style and vulnerability to depression - The role of core beliefs,2000,"This  considers the potential role of core beliefs (unconditional schema-level reations) in the relationship between recalled  in hood and major depression in adulthood, comparing a group of depressed outpatients (N = 60) with a healthy community sample (N = 67). The depressed group were differentiated by poorer perceived  (low care and high overprotection) and by three unhealthy core beliefs (defectiveness/shame, self-sacrifice, and insufficient self-control). Among nonclinical participants, it appears that vulnerability to harm beliefs act as a partial mediator of the relationship between poor paternal care and the development of depressive features. In contrast, a broader set of core beliefs appears to mediate the relationship of maternal bonding and paternal overprotection with depressive symptoms among the depressed group. The findings suggest that clinical work with adults with major depression might need to take account of al . Where s are reported to be uncaring or overprotective, cognitive-behavioral therapy might need to include a schema-focused component."
Self-administered behavioral family intervention for parents of toddlers: Part I.

The  provide support for the efficacy of the self-administered form of behavioral family intervention. There were significant short-term reductions in reported  behavior problems and improvements in maternal  ,  confidence, and anger. Families who received minimal therapist assistance made more clinically significant gains compared with families who completed the program with no therapist assistance. The intervention effects were maintained at 6-month follow-up. The implications of the findings for the population-level delivery of behavioral family interventions are discussed."
The effects of early positive parenting and developmental delay status on  emotion dysregulation,2017,"BackgroundEmotion regulation has been identified as a robust predictor of adaptive functioning across a variety of domains (Aldao et al. ). Furthermore,  examining early predictors of competence and deficits in ER suggests that factors internal to the individual (e.g. neuroregulatory reactivity, behavioural traits and cognitive ability) and external to the individual (e.g. caregiving  and explicit ER training) contribute to the development of ER (Calkins ). Many studies have focused on internal sources or external sources; however, few have studied them simultaneously within one model, especially in studies examining  with developmental delays (DD). Here, we addressed this specific  gap and examined the contributions of one internal factor and one external factor on emotion dysregulation outcomes in middle hood. Specifically, our current  used structural equation modelling (SEM) to examine prospective, predictive relationships between DD status, positive  at age 4years and  emotion dysregulation at age 7years. MethodParticipants were 151 families in the Collaborative Family Study, a longitudinal  of young  with and without DD. A positive  factor was composed of sensitivity and scaffolding scores from mother- interactions at home and in the  centre at  age 4years. A  dysregulation factor was composed of a dysregulation code from mother- interactions and a -report measure of ER and lability/negativity at age 7years. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that positive  would mediate the relationship between DD and  dysregulation. ResultsMothers of  with DD exhibited fewer sensitive and scaffolding behaviours compared with mothers of typically developing , and  with DD were more dysregulated on all measures of ER. SEM revealed that both DD status and early positive  predicted emotion dysregulation in middle hood. Furthermore, findings provided support for our hypothesis that early positive  mediated the relationship between DD and dysregulation. ConclusionsThis work enhances our understanding of the development of ER across hood and how endogenous  factors (DD status) and exogenous family factors (positive ) affect this process. Our findings provide clear implications for early intervention programmes for  with DD. Because of the predictive relationships between (a) developmental status and ER and (b)  and ER, the  imply that sensitive  behaviours should be specifically targeted in  interventions for  with DD."
Does work pay psychologically as well as economically? The role of employment in predicting depressive symptoms and parenting among low-income families,2003,"This longitudinal  examined quantity and quality of maternal employment as predictors of depressive symptoms and   in a sample of 94 low-income mothers whose 4-year-old  were enrolled in Head Start at baseline. Results suggest, that answers to the question of whether work pays are complex: Findings suggest some benefits of greater employment participation while  indicating that women holding lower prestige jobs experienced increases in their use of negative  , net of baseline demographic and psychological characteristics. Sparse evidence for selection processes was found, with cohabitation and maternal depressive symptoms modestly predictive of subsequent maternal employment. Implications of these findings for welfare reform and educationally related policies for low-income families are discussed."
A pilot study of low-income mothers and fathers of preschool age  to determine the relationship of food security and nutrition assistance on feeding style and  body weight,2019,"The objective of this  was to investigate the association of household food security status and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participation with al feeding  and  body mass index (BMI) in low-income households. Mother/father dyads (n = 52) with preschool aged  were interviewed and BMI measured. Food security status was not associated with feeding  but mothers' food insecurity was associated with lower 's BMI z-scores (beta = -.31, p = 0.03). Fathers participating in SNAP had lower odds of an authoritarian feeding  (odds ratio = 0.17, p = 0.05). The relationship of food security or SNAP participation with hood obesity needs further investigation between mothers and fathers."
Self-regulated compliance in preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder: The role of temperament and parental disciplinary style,2016,"Regulatory difficulties are common in  with autism spectrum disorder. This  focused on an important aspect of self-regulationthe ability to willingly comply with frustrating demands of socialization agents, termed self-regulated compliance. We studied compliance to al demands in 40 preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder and 40 matched typically developing preschoolers, during separate interactions with mother and father, while engaging in two paradigms: toy pick-up and delayed gratification, which tap the do and don't aspects of self-regulated socialization at this age. s' disciplinary  was micro-coded from the two paradigms and  temperament was  reported. Compared to their typically developing peers,  with autism spectrum disorder showed more noncompliance and less self-regulated compliance to al demands and prohibitions and greater temperamental difficulties across several domains. No group differences were found in al disciplinary . Child self-regulated compliance was associated with al supportive disciplinary  and with  attention focusing. Findings highlight the importance of al supportive presence in structuring the development of socialization in  with autism spectrum disorder. Implications for - emotion regulation interventions are discussed."
The role of environmental sensitivity in the development of rumination and depressive symptoms in hood: a longitudinal study,,"Some  are more affected than others by their upbringing due to their increased sensitivity to the environment. More sensitive  are at heightened risk for the development of internalizing problems, particularly when experiencing unsupportive . However, little is known about how the interplay between 's sensitivity and  leads to higher levels of depressive symptoms. In the current , we investigated the interaction between early  and 's sensitivity on levels of depressive symptomatology in middle hood, exploring the role of rumination as a possible mediator in a community sample. Participants included 196 USA resident families, from a middle class and mostly European-American background, and their healthy , followed up from age 3 until 9 and 12 years. Environmental sensitivity was assessed observationally when  were 3 years old.   was based on -report at the age of 3 years. When  were nine, they completed questionnaires on rumination and depressive symptoms (repeated at 12 years). Analyses were run applying a Bayesian approach. Children's sensitivity interacted with permissive  in predicting rumination at age 9. Rumination, in turn, was associated with depressive symptoms at age 9 and, to a lesser extent, at age 12. No relevant interactions emerged for authoritative and authoritarian . Sensitive  may be at heightened risk for internalizing problems when exposed to a permissive  . Permissive  was associated with increased ruminative coping strategies in sensitive  which, in turn, predicted higher levels of depression. Hence, rumination emerged as an important cognitive risk factor for the development of depressive symptoms in sensitive ."
Overparenting hurts me: how does it affect offspring psychological outcomes?,2021,"This review focuses on a peculiar typology of  characterized by overprotection, overinvolvement, overcontrol and an excess of entanglement; academic literature refers to this   with the term over or helicopter . An in-depth description of over constitutes the first part of this review. The second part of this review reports empirical evidence regarding the effects of over on offspring psychological outcomes with particular regard to internalizing and externalizing disorders, coping strategies and dysfunctional personality traits. Depression and anxiety symptoms are frequently exhibited in offspring exposed to over, as well as negative affectivity and maladaptive coping. Furthermore, adolescents and adults with over s seem to have an increased likelihood of exhibiting narcissistic pathological traits."

Longitudinal relations between observed parenting behaviors and dietary quality of meals from ages 2 to 5,2015,"Objectives: s influence a 's diet by modeling food choices, selecting the food they make available, and controlling the 's intake. Few studies have examined the covariation between 's behavior management practices and their guidance and support for a young 's nutritional environment in early hood. We hypothesized that s' positive behavior support (PBS), characterized as skillful behavior management and proactive structuring of 's activities, would predict dietary quality over the course of early hood (age 2 to 5 years), a critical period for the development of a dietary life. Methods: Participants included 731 culturally diverse, low-income families in a randomized, controlled trial of the Family Check-Up. Families participated in a yearly home visit videotaped assessment PBS and dietary quality of meals s served to their  were assessed by coding videotapes of structured - interactions. A cross-lagged panel model was used to evaluate the longitudinal relation between PBS and the dietary quality of meals served during a meal preparation task. Results: Analyses revealed that PBS repeatedly predicted meals' dietary quality the following year: age 2-3 (beta = .30), age 3-4 (beta = 0.14), age 4-5 (beta = 0.37). Dietary quality significantly predicted PBS 1 year later: age 3-4 (beta = 0.16), age 4-5 (beta = 0.14). As expected, the relative strength of the relationship from PBS to dietary quality was significantly stronger than the reverse, from dietary quality to PBS. Conclusions: Positive behavior management and proactive  practices are an important foundation for establishing a healthy nutritional environment for young . These findings suggest that family-centered prevention interventions for pediatric obesity may benefit from targeting PBS in service of promoting better dietary quality. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Adjustment to Divorce and Co-parental Relations: Contributions from the Theory of Attachment,2010,"In this article, it is proposed the contribution of the attachment theory for understanding adults' adjustment processes to their divorce and how detachment to ex-spouse can infer in co- relationships after marital dissolution. This article makes two theoretical assumptions that focus on two dimensions. The first hypothesis states that the divorce, while a relational process, should be read as a moment of loss that germinates similar psychological reactions to those experienced by widows. Bowlby describes it in his model of loss of the attachment figure as dependent on attachment  of divorced adults. The second hypothesis argues that the post-divorce co- relationships are predicted by the attachment  and by the quality of s' attachment reorganization. At the end, a theoretical integration is built, based on a proposal for future  in this area."
THE IMPACT OF PARENT TRAINING ON MARITAL FUNCTIONING: A COMPARISON OF TWO GROUP VERSIONS OF THE TRIPLE P-POSITIVE PARENTING PROGRAM FOR PARENTS OF CHILDREN WITH EARLY-ONSET CONDUCT PROBLEMS,2003,"Thirty-seven (37) couples experiencing  behavior problems and concurrent marital conflict were randomly assigned to one of two variants of a group  training program, either Standard Group Triple P (SGTP; n = 19) or Enhanced Group Triple P (EGTP; n = 18). SGTP incorporated 8 sessions (4 group sessions and 4 telephone consultations) and taught s to identify the causes of  behaviour problems, promote 's development, manage misbehavior and plan ahead to prevent  behavior problems in high risk''  situations. Families in the EGTP condition received SGTP plus 2 additional group sessions of  support training that taught partners to support one another to  as a team. These additional sessions included information and active skills training in communication skills; giving and receiving constructive feedback; holding casual conversations; supporting each other when problems occur; holding problem solving discussions; and improving relationship happiness. There were significant improvements from pre- to post-intervention for both conditions, on measures of disruptive  behavior, dysfunctional  , conflict over , relationship satisfaction and communication. No differences, however, were found between the two conditions, with both the EGTP and the SGTP programs ing in similar outcomes. In the main, initial treatment effects for both mothers and fathers were maintained at 3-month follow-up."
"Adult attachment styles, the desire to have , and working models of parenthood",1997,College students who had yet to many and begin a family were asked about their desire to have  and their beliefs and expectations about themselves as s (Study 1) and the characteristics of their prospective  (Study 2). Persons with more avoidant and anxious-ambivalent models of close adult relationships harbored more negative models of hood and - relationships. These findings indicate that working models of  and - relationships form well before marriage and the birth of  and that these models are systematically associated with attachment  in adult relationships. The findings  suggest ways in which insecure attachments between  and  may be influenced by the caregiver's models of  and - relationships.
Parenting after preterm birth: link between infant medical risk and premature parenthood. A pilot study,2016,"BACKGROUND: The aim of the   was to examine the relationship between al emotion regulation, infant medical risks and reation of 's behavior at 3 months corrected age. METHODS: The sample includes 28 couples (s) and 32 preterm infants (4 set of twins) (AG average: 29 weeks), low birth weight (average weight: 1180.62 g), hospitalized for about two months. At the 3(rd) month of corrected age of the  all couples were interviewed using the Clinical Interview for s of High Risk Infants (CLIP), which explores the emotional aspects associated with preterm birth. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using ATLAS.TI. After the interview, only 14 mothers and 14 fathers completed the Behavior Rating Scale (SVC-80; Laicardi, 1998), which explores the observational-reative  of each  with respect to the 's behavior in the context of everyday life. We identified three Couples Groups indicating qualitative differences in the emotional functioning of the subjects mainly in the temporal dimension: 1) 12 future-oriented; 2) 12 suspended in the ; 3) 4 oriented to the past. RESULTS: The  show that the infant's medical status has a impact on ability of s to process the experience of preterm birth: increasing the infant's medical risks increases the difficulty of s ability to process the experience. CONCLUSIONS: The CLIP can be a useful screening tool to identify difficulties of s, to structure interventions focused on the elaboration of the traumatic experience of birth and on improving the quality of -infant relationship."
Risk Trajectories of Self-Destructiveness in Adolescence: Family Core Influences,2014,"The  of family factors, (namely, , attachment and family functioning) that can either reduce or increase risk factors during adolescent development is crucial to the early identification of adolescents at risk for self-destructive thoughts and behaviors (SDTB). Altough several studies have highlighted the role of family factors, few have analysed the joint impact of   and attachment in SDT. This  aimed to: (1) to identify the dimensions of   and al attachment that predict SDTB; (2) to determine the mediation effect of cohesion on the relation between these predictors and reports of SDTB; and (3) to analyze sex and age differences in the abovementioned process. Participants included 1,266 Portuguese adolescents with a mean age of 15.9 years. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that paternal and maternal rejection and paternal control were the most accurate predictors of SDTB, emphasizing their role as risk factors for maladaptive trajectories with reports of SDTB. Results clearly emphasized the relevancy of the fathers' role in such maladaptive trajectories. Additionally, a mediation effect of cohesion and a moderation of sex were  found. This  highlights the importance of intervening with the family in preventive and therapeutic contexts regarding adolescents' well-being and their relationship with s."

The  was based on a qualitative paradigm, emphasizing the case   strategy. The observation and the semi-structured interview were used as information gathering techniques in the participants, who were 9  and their respective s or caregivers. It was obtained that the educational models influence the socio-affective development and the different behaviors of the , and it was concluded that the  who are under authoritarian educational models, tend to be isolated from the social group of reference and those who are educated under democratic educational models are likely to be more autonomous and manage to socialize more easily."
Children's Emotional and Behavioral Problems in the Foster Family Context,2015,"The main aim of this  was to identify the factors which are related to the greatest emotional and behavioral problems among  in the context of a foster family. Participants were 104 non-relative foster  and their respective foster families. A structural equation model was designed and tested in order to identify an explanatory model among the most relevant of the studied variables. The  showed that the model obtained offers a satisfactory structural fit and provides good explanatory power for 's problems. More specifically, the data reveal the important role played by affective relationships and al discipline  in relation to 's problems within the foster family. Other factors involved were  analyzed. These  indicate that both   and the kind of affect shown by foster s towards the  are important predictors of the latter's problems. Criticism/rejection on the part of foster s increases problems through its influence on both the foster carer's burden and the 's self-esteem. These  are useful in order to prepare and support foster carers."
Acculturation and Parenting in First-Generation Chinese Immigrants in the United Kingdom,2015,"This  examined acculturation and  among 37 first-generation Chinese immigrant s in the United Kingdom. The findings showed that these s still felt stronger affiliation with the Chinese than with the English culture. There were  significant positive associations between their affiliation to Chinese culture and their Chinese-specific  as well as between their affiliation to English culture and authoritative . However, the length of their U.K. residence did not affect their Chinese cultural identity or affiliation.

Predicting Harsh Discipline in At-Risk Mothers: The Moderating Effect of Socioeconomic Deprivation Severity,2015,"Socioeconomic disadvantage is an important predictor of maternal harsh discipline, but few studies have examined risk mechanisms for harsh  within disadvantaged samples. In the  ,  stress, family conflict, and  difficult temperament are examined as predictors of maternal harsh discipline among a group of 58 mothers from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds and their young  between the ages of 1- to 4-years-old. Maternal harsh discipline was measured using standardized observations, and mothers reported on  stress, family conflict, and  temperament. Severity of socioeconomic deprivation was included as a moderator in these associations. Results showed that  stress and family conflict predicted maternal harsh discipline, but only in the most severely deprived families. These findings extend prior  on the processes through which socioeconomic deprivation severity and family functioning impact maternal harsh discipline within a high-risk sample of low-income families. They suggest that the spillover of negative al functioning into - interactions is particularly likely under conditions of substantial socioeconomic deprivation. Severity of socioeconomic stress seems to undermine maternal adaptive forms of coping, ing in harsh disciplining practices. Intervention efforts aimed at improving  and family relations, as well as an adaptive coping  assume especial relevance."
"Relationships among parenting stress, health-promoting behaviors, and health-related quality of life in Korean mothers of  with cerebral palsy",2020,"Health-promoting behaviors have been shown to enhance the quality of life across diverse populations. In this , we examined the indirect effects of several health-promoting behaviors on the relationship between  stress and health-related quality of life in mothers of  with cerebral palsy (CP). A convenience sample of Korean mothers (N = 180) of  aged 10 months to 12 years with CP was recruited from clinical and school settings. Health-promoting behaviors were measured using the health-promoting life profile II, which is comprised of six subscales: health responsibility, physical activity, nutrition, spiritual growth, interpersonal relations, and stress management. Multiple mediation analyses were conducted to examine the mediating role of these behavioral categories. Spiritual growth (beta = .56,p < .05) had an indirect effect on the relationship between  stress and physical health-related quality of life while spiritual growth (beta = -1.00,p < .01) and stress management (beta = -.80,p < .05) were found to mediate the association between  stress and mental health-related quality of life. The findings of multiple mediation analyses provide evidence of the influence of specific health-promoting behaviors on health-related quality of life, thereby informing the development of intervention programs for mothers of  with disabilities."

The effect of low parental warmth and low monitoring on disordered eating in mid-adolescence: Findings from the Australian Temperament Project,2016,"Objective: To investigate the interactions between low al warmth and monitoring at age 13-14 years and disordered eating attitudes and behaviours at age 15-16 years. Method: Data on 1300 (667 females) adolescents and their s were drawn from The Australian Temperament Project (ATP), a 30 year (15 wave) population based longitudinal  of social-emotional development.  participants completed surveys on  practices in late hood, and adolescent participants reported disordered eating using the drive for thinness and bulimia subscales of the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) and an additional body dissatisfaction scale. Interaction was examined on the additive scale by estimating super-additive risk; i.e., risk in excess of the sum of individual risks. Results: For boys, neither al warmth or monitoring, nor their interaction, was related to disordered eating. For girls, low al warmth (alone) was associated with bulimic behaviours. In contrast, exposure to both low monitoring and warmth was associated with similar to 31/2-fold, similar to 4-fold and similar to 5-fold increases in the odds of reporting body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness and bulimia, respectively. For body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness, risk associated with joint exposure exceeded the sum of individual risks, suggesting an additive interaction between  . Conclusion: Further investment in family-level interventions that focus on promoting al monitoring behaviour and a warm - relationship remain important strategies for preventing a range of disordered eating behaviours in adolescents.

Does attachment style influence social support or the other way around? A longitudinal study of Early Head Start mothers,2011,"Understanding the association between attachment  and social support is important for informing programs that seek to improve outcomes for families by intervening with either or both of these systems. The   examines whether increasing levels of social support among 181 low-income, primarily African American mothers leads to changes in their self-reported attachment , or whether attachment  influences the extent to which they perceive others as supportive. Results suggest that whereas scores on the avoidant attachment dimension were relatively stable and led to decreasing perceptions of social support over time, scores on the anxious dimension were more malleable, at least under conditions of low stress. For mothers who experienced fewer stressful life events, increasing social support led to decreased attachment anxiety over time. However, when life stress was high, social support had no such positive influence. Implications for the need to attend to mothers' attachment  in providing appropriate and effective intervention are discussed."
Models of traumatic experiences and 's psychological adjustment: The roles of perceived parenting and the 's own resources and activity,1997,"The relations between traumatic events, perceived  , 's resources, political activity, and psychological adjustment were examined among 108 Palestinian boys and girls of 11-12 years of age. The  showed that exposure to traumatic events increased psychological adjustment problems directly and via 2 mediating paths. First, the more traumatic events  had experienced, the more negative  they experienced. And, the poorer they perceived , the more they suffered from high neuroticism and low self-esteem. Second, the more traumatic events  had experienced, the more political activity they showed, and the more active they were, the more they suffered from psychological adjustment problems. Good perceived  protected 's psychological adjustment by making them less vulnerable in two ways. First, traumatic events decreased their intellectual, creative, and cognitive resources, and a lack of resources predicted many psychological adjustment problems in a model excluding perceived . Second, political activity increased psychological adjustment problems in the same model, but not in the model including good ."
"THE RELATION OF OCCUPATIONAL IDENTITY, AND FAMILY BACKGROUND VARIABLES IN A HUNGARIAN SAMPLE OF EMERGING ADULTS",2019,"Background: In the last few decades, identity formation has been postponed until the mid or late twenties (ARNETT 2000). ARNETT calls this specific period between 19-27 emerging adulthood. According to WATERMAN (1999), some family variables can foster or hinder the process of identity development. In our , we investigate the relation of   described by BAUMRIND (1991), two- or one- family backgrounds, and occupational identity. Among the dimensions of identity, we will focus on occupational identity, since it has great importance in this period of life. Method: Besides demographic variables and data regarding the participants' family background, we used the Melgosa Occupational Identity Scale (OIS), al Authority Questionnaire (PAQ). The sample consisted of 220 19-29-year-old emerging adults. Results: According to our hypothesis, identity diffusion and moratorium show a slightly negative correlation with age. Regarding occupational identity, it seems significant whether the person could or could not find a job in accordance with their qualifications: the moratorium is higher among those who could not, while foreclosure and identity achievement is higher among those who found a job in their professional field. Regarding family background, it seems that  of divorced s do now show higher rates of less adaptive identity statuses, but foreclosure is higher among  raised in two- families. Conforming to our expectations, we found that permissive  is related to identity diffusion, while interestingly, both the father's and the mother's authoritative  is related to foreclosure."
Maternal feeding style and  weight status among Hispanic families with low-income levels: a longitudinal study of the direction of effects,2021,"Background The home environment is a central and modifiable influence on the development of hood obesity. Evidence supports the central role of s in shaping problematic  eating behaviors and excess weight. Most studies of feeding emphasize -driven influences without taking into account the 's role in eating interactions. Few studies have addressed the bi-directional nature of feeding dynamics in studies of young . Methods The goals of this  were: 1) to examine if al feeding  during preschool (4-5 years) predict  weight status at 7-9 years, and 2) to examine the direction of effects between al feeding  and  weight status over time. Participants were part of a larger longitudinal  of Hispanic Head Start families living in the West South Central United States. Data from mother/ dyads were collected at three time points: Time 1 (ages 4-5), Time 2 (ages 5 1/2-6 1/2), and at Time 3 (ages 7-9). Only data from the Times 1 and 3 were used in the current analyses. A total of 128 mothers and their  had data on all variables needed for the analyses. Assessments included -reported feeding , feeding practices, acculturation,  eating behaviors, and  height and weight. Hierarchical regression was used to examine the first aim; a cross-lagged panel analysis examined the second aim. Results An indulgent al feeding  at ages 4-5 was associated with increased  BMI z-score at ages 7-9. Indulgent feeding significantly contributed to  BMI z-score beyond demographics, baseline  BMI z-score, al acculturation, and  eating behaviors. Regarding the direction of effects in al feeding interactions, the cross-lagged analyses showed that both indulgent feeding  and authoritative feeding  at Time 1 positively predicted  BMI z-scores at Time 3. Child effects were significant as well. Child BMI z-score at Time 1 positively predicted indulgent feeding and negatively predicted authoritarian feeding at Time 3. Conclusions Indulgent feeding should be addressed in future family-focused hood obesity initiatives focused on young  and their s."

"What mothers say and what they do: The relation between parenting, theory of mind, language and conflict/cooperation",2006,"We used a longitudinal  with 55 middle- and upper middle-class  to investigate the relation between early mother characteristics (e.g. mental state talk, general  ) and later  characteristics (e.g. theory of mind, conflict/cooperation). Children were tested once when they were around 3 years and then again around 4 years. At each time point,  were given a task in which mothers helped the  and a friend draw items with a drawing toy. We examined 2 measures of  theory of mind (task performance and mental state talk), and 4 measures of conflict/cooperation. Early mother mental state talk was uniquely related to both later theory of mind measures and 2 of 4 later conflict/cooperation measures. Mother   (warmth) was uniquely related only to 1 later  conflict/cooperation measure. Child theory of mind was not related to any  conflict/cooperation measures. Thus, it seems to be only what mothers say (their mental state talk) that relates to  theory of mind, and both what they say and what they do (their warmth) that relates to  conflict/cooperation."

Do Personality Traits Moderate Relations Between Psychologically Controlling Parenting and Problem Behavior in Adolescents?,2016,"This  examined whether and how adolescents' personality traits moderate associations between psychologically controlling  and problem behaviors. On the basis of self-determination theory, we  examined the mediating role of psychological need frustration in the effects of psychologically controlling . A cross-sectional  in two samples (N = 423 and 292; M-age = 12.43 and 15.74 years) was conducted. While in Sample 1 both mothers and adolescents provided reports of  and problem behavior, Sample 2 relied on adolescent-reported  and mother-reported problem behavior. Psychologically controlling  was related to internalizing and externalizing problems in both samples. Little systematic evidence was obtained for the moderating role of personality, with the exception of a moderating effect of Agreeableness. In both samples, psychological control was unrelated to externalizing problems among adolescents high on Agreeableness. Analyses of Sample 2 showed that associations between psychological control and problem behavior were mediated by psychological need frustration. Adolescent personality plays a modest role as a moderator of associations between psychologically controlling  and problem behavior. Frustration of adolescents' basic and universal psychological needs can account for the undermining effects of psychologically controlling . Directions for future  are discussed."
Aversive parenting in China: Associations with  physical and relational aggression,2006,"This  assessed the combined and differential contributions of Chinese mothers and fathers (in terms of spouse-reported physically coercive and psychologically controlling ) to the development of peer-reported physical and relational aggression in their preschool-age  (mean age of 5 years). Results of the two-group (boys and girls) latent sum and difference structural equation model showed that combined  effects were slightly more prevalent than differential effects in predicting aggression. Furthermore, physical coercion was predictive of aggression in boys whereas psychological control was primarily associated with aggression in girls. Findings extend our understanding of relational aggression and the meaning of aversive , particularly within the Chinese cultural context."
The Mediating Role of Anxiety Sensitivity in Uncontrolled Drinking: A Look at Gender-Specific Parental Influences,2018,"BackgroundAnxiety sensitivity (AS) reflects an individual's belief that experiencing anxiety will cause illness or embarrassment, and may be a reason individuals self-medicate with alcohol. Harsh or indulgent  could contribute to the development of AS. We examined the direct and indirect associations between   and alcohol-related variables through AS and impaired control over drinking (IC; i.e., perceived failure to adhere to limits on alcohol consumption in the future). MethodsA multiple-group structural equationmodel with 614 university students (344 men; 270 women) was examined. Structural invariance tests were conducted to evaluate moderation by gender. We used a bias corrected bootstrap technique to obtain the mediated effects. ResultsFather authoritarianism and mother permissiveness were directly linked to AS among women, whereas father permissiveness was directly linked to AS among men. This suggests unique al influences based on gender regarding AS. While AS was directly linked to alcohol-related problems for both men and women, several gender-specific associations were found. AS was directly linked to IC for men but not for women. For men, father permissiveness was directly related to AS, and AS mediated the indirect link between father permissiveness and IC along both the heavy episodic drinking and alcohol-related problems pathways. Similar to other internalizing constructs (e.g., neuroticism and depression), higher AS was directly associated with less heavy episodic drinking but more alcohol-related problems. ConclusionsOur findings highlight the dangers of AS for men as an important correlate of under-controlled drinking behaviors. Additionally, permissive  of the same-gender  was associated with AS, which is consistent with the gender-matching hypothesis. Together, these  underscore the importance of measuring the independent influence of both s."
Maternal Styles of Talking about Child Feeding across Sociodemographic Groups,2011,"This  sought to identify maternal  of talking about  feeding from a semistructured interview and to evaluate associated maternal and  characteristics. Mothers of preschool-aged  (n=133) of diverse race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES) (45 lower SES black, 29 lower SES white, 32 lower SES Hispanic, 15 middle to upper SES white, and 12 middle to. upper SES Asian) participated in a semistructured interview about feeding. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed. Themes were identified, and individual interviews were coded within these themes: authority (high/low), confidence (confident/conflicted/unopinionated), and investment (deep/mild/removed). Demographic characteristics were collected and a subset of  had measured weights and heights. Cluster analysis was used to identify narrative . Participant characteristics were compared across clusters using Fisher's exact test and analysis of variance. Six narrative  were identified: Easy-Going, Practical No-Nonsense, Disengaged, Effortful No-Nonsense, Indulgent Worry, and Conflicted Control. Cluster membership differed significantly based on maternal demographic group (P<0.001) and  weight status (P<0.05). More than half (60%) of  of mothers in the Conflicted Control cluster were obese. Maternal  of talking about feeding are associated with maternal and  characteristics. J Am Diet Assoc. 2011;111:1861-1867."
"The relationship between optimal parenting, Internet addiction and motives for social networking in adolescence",2013,"This paper s a cross-sectional  of a large, high-school Greek student sample (N=1971) with the aim to examine adolescent motives for participating in social networking (SN) for a possible link with   and cognitions related to Internet addiction disorder (IAD). Exploratory statistics demonstrate a shift from the prominence of online gaming to social networking for this age group. A regression model provides with the best linear combination of independent variables useful in predicting participation in SN. Results  include a validated model of negative correlation between optimal  on the one hand and motives for SN participation and IAD on the other. Examining cognitions linked to SN may assist in a better understanding of underlying adolescent wishes and problems. Future  may focus in the patterns unveiled among those adolescents turning to SN for the gratification of basic unmet psychological needs. The debate on the exact nature of IAD would benefit from the inclusion of SN as a possible online activity where addictive phenomena may occur. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
Similarities and differences in mothers' parenting of preschoolers in China and the United States,2002,"This investigation was designed to extend the work of Chao (1994) by examining  constructs emphasised in the Chinese culture in conjunction with  constructs derived and emphasised in North America. Mothers of preschool-age  from mainland China (N = 284) and the United States (N = 237) completed two self-report  questionnaires. One assessed dimensions of  practices emphasised in China (encouragement of modesty, protection, directiveness, shaming/love withdrawal, and maternal involvement). The second measured specific stylistic dimensions within Baumrind's global conceptualisations of authoritative (warmth/acceptance, reasoning/induction, democratic participation) and authoritarian (physical coercion, verbal hostility, nonreasoning/ punitive) . Mostly invariant factor structures were obtained across cultures for both measures. Results showed that the five  constructs emphasised in China were mostly nonoverlapping and independent in both cultures. In addition, the  constructs emphasised in China were relatively independent from the constructs emphasised in North America. As anticipated, Chinese mothers scored higher than US mothers on all  constructs emphasised in China except maternal involvement. For  constructs emphasised in North America, Chinese mothers scored lower than US mothers on warmth/acceptance and democratic participation, but scored higher on physical coercion."
Heterogeneity in Perceptions of Parenting Among Arab Refugee Adolescents in Jordan,2018,"Heterogeneity in  was examined in 883 Arab refugee adolescents in Jordan (M-age=15.01years, SD=1.60). Latent profile analyses of five  dimensions rated separately for mothers and fathers yielded authoritative, authoritarian, indifferent, punitive, and for mothers, permissive profiles, with most mothers (60%) and fathers (66%) classified as authoritative.  was more often authoritative for women than men and punitive (for fathers) or permissive (for mothers) of boys than girls. Authoritative fathers and authoritarian mothers were better educated than punitive s, whose offspring reported more norm breaking and internalizing symptoms and lower academic achievement than other youth. Adjustment was better when adolescents had at least one authoritative  than when s were either consistent or discrepant but nonauthoritative."
Family Predictors of Continuity and Change in Social and Physical Aggression From Ages 9 to 18,2014,"This  examined developmental trajectories for social and physical aggression for a sample followed from age 9 to 18, and investigated possible family predictors of following different trajectory groups. Participants were 158 girls and 138 boys, their teachers, and their s (21% African American, 5.3% Asian, 51.6% Caucasian, and 21% Hispanic). Teachers rated 's social and physical aggression yearly in grades 3-12. Participants'  (83% mothers) reported on family income, conflict strategies, and maternal authoritarian and permissive  . The  suggested that both social and physical aggression decline slightly from middle hood through late adolescence. Using a dual trajectory model, group-based mixture modeling revealed three trajectory groups for both social and physical aggression: low-, medium-, and high-desisting for social aggression, and stably-low, stably-medium, and high-desisting for physical aggression. Membership in higher trajectory groups was predicted by being from a single- family, and having a  high on permissiveness. Being male was related to both elevated physical aggression trajectories and the medium- desisting social aggression trajectory. Negative interal conflict strategies did not predict social or physical aggression trajectories when permissive  was included in the model. Permissive  in middle hood predicted following higher social aggression trajectories across many years, which suggests that s setting fewer limits on 's behaviors may have lasting consequences for their peer relations. Future  should examine transactional relations between   and practices and aggression to understand the mechanisms that may contribute to changes in involvement in social and physical aggression across hood and adolescence.

English Validation of the Parental Socialization Scale-ESPA29,2017,"  have traditionally been studied following the classical two-dimensional orthogonal model of al socialization. The al Socialization Scale ESPA29 is used to measure the four  of al socialization through the acceptance/involvement and strictness/imposition dimensions. The ESPA29 scale is a developmentally appropriate measure of  , which has been validated in several languages including Spanish, Italian, and Brazilian Portuguese. In this , the English translation of the ESPA29 was evaluated. The objective of the work is to test the ESPA29's structure of  practices with a United States sample measuring  practices using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The scores of fathers' and mothers' behavioral practices toward their  were obtained for a sample of 911 United States adolescents between 14 and 18 years of age. First, the total sample was split and a principal components analysis with varimax rotation was carried out with one of the two halves. EFA showed a two-factor structure fully congruent with the theoretical model for mothers' and fathers' scores. Next, a CFA was calculated on the second half by using the factor structure obtained in the previous EFA. The CFA replicated the two-factor structure with appropriate fit index. The seven  practices that were measured loaded appropriately on the acceptance/involvement and strictness/imposition dimensions. Then, the multigroup analysis between girls and boys showed equal loading in the factors and equal covariation between the acceptance/involvement and the strictness/imposition dimensions. Additionally, the two dimensions of the ESPA29 scale were related to self-esteem in order to obtain an external validity index. The findings confirm the invariant structure of the ESPA29 was in the United States and their equivalence in both fathers' and mothers' scores. These findings validate the instrument and confirm its applicability in cross-cultural  on  practices and  adjustment."
Reducing Work and Family Conflict in Teachers: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Workplace Triple P,2013,"The purpose of this  was to evaluate the efficacy of a workplace  intervention aimed at reducing work-family conflict and improving work and family functioning in teachers. One hundred and seven teachers (who were  s) were randomly allocated to either a Workplace Triple P intervention condition or a waitlist control condition. Analyses indicated the intervention had a positive effect on a range of occupational variables including work-to-family conflict, family-to-work conflict, occupational stress and teaching efficacy. Intervention effects were  found for family- and personal adjustment-related variables including dysfunctional  ,  behaviour,  efficacy, and depression and anxiety. Small to large effect sizes were obtained (Cohen's d = .34-.85), and all intervention effects were maintained at 4-month follow-up. The  indicate that a  intervention can reduce work-family conflict and occupational stress and improve family functioning in teachers balancing work and family. The implications for supporting teachers with family interventions delivered in the workplace are discussed."
Parental inconsistency versus parental authoritarianism: Associations with symptoms of psychological disorders,2008,"While in western countries, such as the US and Europe, authoritarian  is associated with negative psycho-social outcomes. Studies have indicated that this is not the case in collective/authoritarian cultures. It has been hypothesized that inconsistency in   and culture contributes to these negative outcomes. In this  a scale of authoritarian  and al inconsistency has been developed. This scale and other scales of authoritarian , adolescent-family connectedness, and psychological disorders were administered to 72 female and 106 male 11th grade Arab students. The  show that, while no measures of authoritarian  were associated with psychological disorders, all the measures of al inconsistency were so associated. The  give empirical support to theories that indicate that al inconsistency is an important factor in psychopathology. More  that is focused on inconsistency is needed across different psychological symptoms and across cultures."
"Parental bonding styles in schizophrenia, depressive and bipolar patients: a comparative study",2021,"BackgroundNumerous bio-psychosocial factors play a role in the etiology of psychiatric disorders. In this regard, the relationship between s and their  is significantly involved in developing the offspring mental health. However, there is no clear-cut answer as to which al bonding  is more strongly associated with psychiatric diseases of patients. This  aimed to compare al bonding  in patients with schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder in Bushehr province, Iran in 2018.MethodsIn this cross-sectional comparative , 130 patients with schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder who referred to four outpatients psychiatric centers in Bushehr were selected using quota sampling. The patients were assessed and compared in terms of al bonding . Data were collected using a valid and reliable al bonding instrument (PBI). Data were analyzed using SPSS software (ver. 22), Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests at a significant level of 0.05.ResultsResults showed that the optimal al bonding  (low control, high care) in bipolar disorder (43.05%), major depression (47.7%), and schizophrenia (38.5%) was the most prevalent  of al bonding; however, 62.30% of the above patients suffered from inefficient paternal bonding  and 51.53% from inefficient maternal bonding . Furthermore, the patients' maternal bonding  were significantly different (p=0.007) while their paternal bonding  did not show any significant differences (p=0.848).ConclusionsMost of the patients with psychiatric disorders were affected by ineffective  . The   confirmed that despite the several bio-psycho-social factors involved in the development of psychiatric disorders, the crucial roles of s, especially mothers, should not be ignored. It was further suggested that s and al bonding were important and fundamental factors for mental health promotion."
The Teacher-Student Relationship in the Light of Different Theoretical Approaches,2017,"Studies on the teacher-student relationship have a long tradition within psychological . Previous approaches have shown that the teacher-student relationship is a multidimensional and dynamic concept that depending on the theoretical orientation is differently conceptualized. The current review article introduces and critically discusses three established theoretical approaches ( on  , Attachment Theory, and Self-Determination Theory) aiming to identify capabilities and deficits that might be used to derive  desiderata. In sum, it can be shown that depending on the theoretical orientation different aspects of the teacher-student relationship are empirically focused, which make it difficult to compare different  . Finally, it is essential to theoretically and empirically give better consideration to the complexity of the teacher-student relationship to be able to generate more specific implications for teacher education and school practice."
Impact of self-efficacy and parenting practice on physical activity among school ,2017,"As insufficient engagement in physical activity (PA) is becoming a major health concern in Thailand, we aimed to investigate the impact of  practices and 's self-efficacy on a 's PA level and further in the subgroups, stratified by the 's sex and weight status. A total of 609 primary school  recruited by cluster sampling in two schools were asked to complete questionnaires, and general familial factors and  practice related to activities were completed by s. Multivariate linear regressions were conducted to calculate the standardized beta-coefficients (b). Children's PA level was positively related to greater support seeking self-efficacy (beta=0.281) for engaging in PA, and  practices, including less limit setting (beta=-0.124) and more discipline (beta=0.147) in the total sample. In the analyses of subgroups by a 's sex and weight status,  practice, such as less limit setting and discipline played a more important role in 's PA in normal weight  and girls as taking account of around 10% of variance of the 's PA, while only seeking support self-efficacy showed great impact in overweight  and boys. In conclusion, impacts of 's self-efficacy and  practices on 's PA were different by 's sex and weight status. This can suggest that future interventions to increase 's PA might need to consider different strategies to increase 's self-efficacy as well as  strategies when targeting different groups of ."
Maternal Predictors of Behavioral Problems Among Mexican Migrant Farmworker Children,2010,"This  investigated the impact of maternal  factors on the emotional and behavioral health of Mexican Migrant Head Start . Although the majority of  sampled in this  did not exhibit problematic behaviors, the findings concluded that  who demonstrated emotional and behavioral problems experienced a more rejecting maternal  , greater  stress, and mothers reporting feelings of depression. Gender differences were found between the behavioral and emotional problems of sons and daughters. Surprisingly, years in the United States, maternal birthplace, income, education, and language spoken in the home were not associated with  behavioral problems."
"Impact of Divorce and Mother's Psychological Well-Being on Children's Emotional, Behavioral, and Social Competences",2015,"al divorce was known for over 40 years as being the cause of some serious, long lasting behavioural, emotional, social and academic problems in .

We have studied a group of 79  and adolescents selected from one school in Timisoara (Romania), aged between 7-15 years, and their mothers. The  were divided into two groups: 41  and adolescents from divorced families and a control group of 38  and adolescents from two s (normal) families. The following instruments were used: Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to measure the 's emotions, behaviour and social competencies; Symptom Checklist (SCL-90-R) to measure the mother's psychological wellbeing; The  Scale to identify the   used by mothers in the educational process. The  showed that  from divorced families have more emotional problems compared with  coming from two s families; the divorced mothers have higher scores at all psychological problems compared with married mother and are more likely to be over reactive or have more hostility in their  , while the married mothers are more lax in their  . Emotional and behavioural problems of  from divorced families were strongly correlated with their mother's problems. In conclusion, the psychological wellbeing of divorced mothers have a certain influence on the 's adjustment, and thus, on the ability of the  to cope with the divorce situation."
Obesity Risk in Children: The Role of Acculturation in the Feeding Practices and Styles of Low- Income Hispanic Families,2015,"Background:  feeding has been associated with  overweight/obesity in low-income families. Because acculturation to the United States has been associated with increased adult obesity, our  aim was to determine whether acculturation was associated with feeding in these populations. Methods: Low-income Hispanic mothers of preschoolers were recruited to participate in a longitudinal  examining  eating behaviors. At baseline, mothers completed questionnaires on feeding , feeding practices, and acculturation. Regression analyses compared feeding  and food  practices of first-generation, immigrant mothers born outside the United States (n=138) and mothers born in the United States (n=31). The correlates of acculturation with these same constructs were  examined. Results: Immigrant mothers reported using highly directive food  practices more often than mothers born in the United States, including pressuring their  to consume more food, using food as a reward, and controlling  food intake by limiting less-healthy foods. First-generation mothers were more likely to show authoritarian, and less likely to show indulgent, feeding . Greater maternal acculturation was associated with less restriction of food for weight reasons. Conclusions: Although first-generation, immigrant mothers reported using highly controlling food  practices with their , those born in the United States were more indulgent with their  in the feeding context. Mechanisms that promote greater indulgence in more-acculturated mothers need to be identified."
The parenting attitudes and the stress of mothers predict the asthmatic severity of their : a prospective study,2010,"Objective: To examine relationships between a mother's stress-related conditions and  attitudes and their 's asthmatic status. Methods: 274 mothers of an asthmatic  2 to 12 years old completed a questionnaire including questions about their chronic stress/coping behaviors (the Stress Inventory),  attitudes ( the Ta-ken Diagnostic Test for -Child Relationship,  Form), and their 's disease status. One year later, a follow-up questionnaire was mailed to the mothers that included questions on the 's disease status. Results: 223 mothers (81%) responded to the follow-up survey. After controlling for non-psychosocial factors including disease severity at baseline, multiple linear regression analysis followed by multiple logistic regression analysis found chronic irritation/anger and emotional suppression to be aggravating factors for  aged < 7 years; for  aged 7 and over, the mothers' egocentric behavior was a mitigating factor while interference was an aggravating factor. Conclusions: Different types of al stress/coping behaviors and   may differently predict their 's asthmatic status, and such associations may change as  grow."
'We know it works but does it last?' The implementation of the KEEP foster and kinship carer training programme in England,2016,"Recent years have seen an increased availability of well-ed  programmes but few are designed to address the specific needs of foster carers, including kinship carers, or are able to demonstrate longer-term outcomes. The KEEP training programme (Keeping foster and kinship carers trained and supported) was developed by Dr Patricia Chamberlain in the US state of Oregon and brought over to England in 2009 by the Department for Education (DfE) as part of the drive to improve outcomes for looked after . KEEP is designed to strengthen foster and kinship carer  skills, reduce foster 's behavioural and emotional difficulties and increase placement stability. Training programmes for carers of  aged from three to 17 are now running in 24 local authorities across the country. The implementation of the KEEP programme in England, supported by the National Implementation Service, includes outcome data on 572  and young people and their carers that demonstrate significant improvements in  problem behaviour and carer stress, and positive changes in  discipline  consistent with findings from the original large randomised controlled trial. In addition, longer-term outcome data for six- and 12-month post-group follow-up for KEEP Standard (for carers of  aged 5-12 years) and KEEP Safe (for carers of adolescents) show that significant improvements in behavioural difficulties, foster carer stress and  discipline  are all maintained. Evidence for longer-term improvements in placement stability is currently limited by a lack of comparative data."
Stop! Collaborate and Listen: A Content Analysis of Peer-Reviewed Articles Investigating Parenting Strategies for Managing Adolescent Internet Use,2020,"Research on how families deal with setting boundaries and rules for young family members is very limited in the field of family therapy. By using content analysis methods, the six authors were able to qualitatively analyze the findings from 28 evidence-based articles from multiple journals that yielded five themes that may prove useful for educators, family therapists, ers and s. The five themes include: al Efficacy;  Styles; Mediation, Monitoring and Collaboration; Adolescent Risk and Risky Behavior; and Adolescent Constructive Internet Use. s with positive Internet experience and s who employed a more positive attitude toward their adolescents appeared to be more efficacious in controlling their adolescents' use of the Internet. Age and gender were important in how s monitored the Internet usage of their daughters and sons; older adolescents were given more freedom of choice. s who embraced an authoritative   mediated Internet use more than authoritarian or neglectful s. Implications suggest that s are more successful in setting boundaries when they themselves have more than basic skills, are willing to negotiate Internet use with their adolescents, and are aware of gender differences in Internet use. Therapeutic strategies for building healthy Internet use in families include: developing family values that include input from the adolescent; building  skills and understanding of the Internet; and supporting s in mentoring and guiding their adolescents in setting healthy boundaries that fit their maturity and gender. It is crucial that therapists help s protect their  as they take a collaborative and positive approach to educating their  about both the risks and positive aspects of the Internet."
Parental Roles in The Circle of Life Representations of Parents and Parenting in Disney Animated Films from 1937 to 2017,2020,"With such an expansive global reach, greater  is needed to evaluate messaging within Disney animated films as it relates to societal implications. The  analysis examined the portrayal of s and  over time through a census content analysis of 85 Disney animated and computer-animated films that aired from 1937 to 2017. The constructs of  demographics, al configurations,  roles within and outside of the home, and  behaviors were examined. Results revealed that the vast majority of s were viewed as mature, competent adults, with 56% use of the authoritative  . Father figures were significantly more likely to use authoritarian and permissive al approaches whereas female caregivers were more authoritative. Although s were portrayed as overall mature and competent adults, implications are discussed regarding the portrayal of al approaches that do not provide  with the support needed to overcome obstacles."
Utilizing a Board Game to Measure Family/Parenting Factors and Childhood Obesity Risk,2019,"Objective: To describe a direct observational approach (ie, interactive family board game) to measure family functioning and  behaviors of relevance to  weight and weight-related behaviors and to examine family functioning and  factors from multiple family dyads (eg, siblings, -) and their associations with  weight and weight-related behaviors. Design: Cross-sectional, mixed-methods . Setting: Two home visits were conducted with families 10 days apart with a 7-day observational period between home visits. Participants: Children (n = 150) aged 5-7 years and their families from 1 of 6 racial and ethnic or immigrant and refugee groups, including African American, Hispanic, Hmong, Native American, Somali, and white, participated in the Family Matters  between 2014 and 2016. Main Outcome Measure: Child weight status and weight-related behaviors (ie, diet quality, physical activity). Analysis: Adjusted logistic and linear regression models with robust SEs were used in analysis. Results: Higher family functioning scores across the majority of family dyads were significantly associated with lower  weight status (P < .05). In addition, some family functioning scores were associated with  diet and physical activity, but not consistently.  behavior scores were inconsistently associated with  weight and weight-related outcomes. Conclusions and Implications: Results suggest that the interactive family board game task is a direct observational approach that ers can use with family members to measure family functioning and  behaviors related to hood obesity. Future interventions may want to consider including multiple family members in both measurement and intervention development to target hood obesity."
Linking lack of care in hood to anxiety disorders in emerging adulthood: the role of attachment styles,2015,"BackgroundEmotional neglect can be characterized as cold or critical  and denotes a  intentionally or unintentionally overlooking the signs that a  needs comfort or attention and ignoring its emotional needs. al emotional neglect is widely posited as an antecedent of anxiety disorder, with attachment ers arguing for anxious-ambivalent attachment  as a mediating factor. MethodChildhood experience of neglect and abuse, including antipathy (cold, critical ), attachment , and anxiety disorders were assessed in a high-risk sample of 160 adolescents and young adults by means of interview measures. ResultsAntipathy was associated with 12-month prevalence of anxiety disorders in the sample. Anxious-ambivalent attachment scores statistically mediated the relationship between antipathy and anxiety disorders. ConclusionsClinicians treating anxiety disorders in youths need to consider that emotional neglect in hood in the form of antipathy could lead to anxious-ambivalent internal working models operating around fear of rejection and fear of separation."
Parental Advocacy Styles for Special Education Students During the Transition to Adulthood,2013,"In an ethnographic  of planning for the transition to adulthood, we explored al advocacy  in special education settings for youth and young adults with chronic health conditions and developmental disabilities. Of 61 s, 43 were satisfied with outcomes in negotiations for school services for their . We identified three al advocacy  for these s: (a) high-profile s, who insisted on specific, wide-ranging services for their  that often ed in conflict with educators; (b) strategic s, who negotiated for selected goals and were willing to compromise, and (c) grateful-gratifier s, who formed close relationships with educators and trusted them to make appropriate decisions. Eighteen s were overwhelmed, burned out, or unfocused, and generally dissatisfied with outcomes of educational planning meetings. Professional efforts to enhance al advocacy can target development of skills and strategies that have worked for successful negotiators."
Normative family interactions - Hmong American adolescents' perceptions of their parents,2008,"Hmong American adolescents' perceptions of their s were examined using the   and family ecologies models. Individual interviews of forty 11- to 18-year-old Hmong American teenagers ed in open-ended and fixed-choice responses. In the open-ended responses, adolescents emphasized themes of al involvement and depending on the family for support. The theme of depending on the family was more commonly used to describe mothers, whereas respectful relationships was used more frequently to describe fathers. Two emergent themes were the adolescents' views of fathers as hard-working but absent and the adolescents' understanding that s were preparing them for the good life. Using fixed-choice warmth and behavioral control scores, 40% of mothers and 27.5% of fathers were identified as authoritative. The remaining s showed authoritarian, permissive, or neglectful  . The older adolescents described relationships with s that were less close than the descriptions provided by younger adolescents."
"Children's Inattention and Hyperactivity, Mother's Parenting, and Risk Behaviors in Adolescence: A 10-Year Longitudinal Study of Chilean Children",2019,"Objective: To examine how mothers' nurturant and, separately, hostile  mediate the effects of young 's inattentiveness and hyperactivity on risk behaviors in adolescence. Method: Data were analyzed from 920 healthy Chilean , studied at 5.5, 10 years, and adolescence. Children's hyperactivity and inattentiveness at 5.5 years were assessed by mother ratings on the Children's Adaptive Behavior Inventory. Mothers' nurturance and hostility toward the  at 10 years were assessed by maternal interview on the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment. Youth's delinquent and aggressive behaviors in adolescence were compiled from the Youth Self-Report questionnaire, and youth's substance use in adolescence was assessed by an extensive self-report substance use inventory. Structural equation modeling was used to identify direct and indirect effects. Results: Findings supported a mediating effect, with more severe  hyperactivity at 5.5 years leading to mothers' greater hostility toward her  at age 10, which, in turn, led to greater delinquency and aggression in adolescence. Marginal mediating effects were  found from  hyperactivity and inattention at 5.5 years to mothers' lower nurturance at 10 years to youth substance use in adolescence. Conclusion: Mothers' hostile treatment of  with hyperactive or inattentive behaviors contributed to adolescent risk behaviors and is an area of intervention."
The Effects of Family Financial Stress and Primary Caregivers' Levels of Acculturation on Children's Emotional and Behavioral Problems among Humanitarian Refugees in Australia,2020,"The   evaluated the application of the basic and extended (incorporated primary caregivers' levels of acculturation) Family Stress Model (FSM) to understand the effect of family financial stress and primary caregivers' levels of acculturation on 's emotional and behavioral problems among refugees in Australia. A total of 658 refugee  aged 5-17 and their primary caregivers (n = 410) from the third wave of a nationwide longitudinal project were included in this . We used multilevel structural equation models with bootstrapping to test the indirect effects of family financial stress and caregivers' levels of acculturation (including English proficiency, self-sufficiency, social interaction, and self-identity) on 's emotional and behavioral problems through caregivers' psychological distress and  . The  showed that the extended FSM improved the model fit statistics, explaining 45.8% variation in 's emotional and behavioral problems. Family financial stress, caregivers' English proficiency, and self-identity had indirect effects on 's emotional and behavioral problems through caregivers' psychological distress and hostile . The findings showed that interventions aimed at reducing caregivers' psychological distress and negative  could be effective in alleviating the adverse effects of family financial stress and caregivers' low levels of acculturation on refugee 's mental health."
Family intervention in Indigenous communities: emergent issues in conducting outcome ,2007,"Objective: Indigenous  and youth are at greater risk of emotional and behavioural problems than non-Indigenous youth, with family life stresses and   identified as common risk factors. There is substantial evidence that  programs can improve family relationships and improve  outcomes, however little  has focused on Indigenous communities. Our team is conducting  to evaluate a culturally sensitive adaptation of a mainstream intervention, the Group Triple P - Positive  Program, for Indigenous families. This paper shares some of the insights into  and clinical issues gained as non-Indigenous ers working with urban, rural and remote Indigenous communities. Methods: The experience of the  team and feedback from practitioners and s have been drawn on for this discussion. Conclusions:  programs need to be sensitive to the political and cultural context in which  takes place, flexibly incorporate cultural practices and expectations, and develop an evidence base of outcomes for families in diverse communities. As  is needed to evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of these programs, culturally sensitive  practices are  necessary and the value of program evaluation and its benefit to the community must be clear. Community acceptance of the  process and the intervention itself is vital and may be influenced by community perceptions, current priorities, and local issues. If our overall aim is to increase the skilled health and mental health workforce in Indigenous communities and their use of evidence-based interventions, ongoing collaborative relationships between  institutions and service providers will serve to further this aim."
Parenting received in hood and early separation anxiety in male conscripts with adjustment disorder,2002,"The purpose of this  was to investigate  received in hood and early separation anxiety experiences in young male soldiers with adjustment disorder. Fifty-four conscripts suffering from adjustment disorder completed the following questionnaires: the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), the Measurement of al Style (MOPS), and the Separation Anxiety Symptom Inventory (SASI). Seventy-eight conscripts, matched for age and education, were used as a control sample. The  showed that compared with the controls, patients had significantly increased scores on the SCL-90-R (p < 0.001), the SASI (p < 0.03), and the father's and mother's MOPS Abuse subscale (p < 0.001). The father's MOPS Abuse score, the mother's MOPS Overcontrol score, and the SASI score were  significantly correlated with the SCL-90-R score (p < 0.01). Finally, a patient's separation anxiety can be predicted from the mother's overcontrol behavior, and the severity of the disorder can be predicted from the father's abuse behavior. These findings are in agreement with previous findings in patients with depression and anxiety disorders."
The influence of maternal care and overprotection on youth adrenocortical stress response: a multiphase growth curve analysis,2016,"We examined the association between two dimensions of maternal   (care and overprotection) and cortisol response to an acute laboratory-induced stressor in healthy youth. Forty-three participants completed the al Bonding Instrument and an adapted version of the Trier Social Stress Test-Child (TSST-C). Nine cortisol samples were collected to investigate heterogeneity in different phases of youth's stress response. Multiphase growth-curve modeling was utilized to create latent factors corresponding to individual differences in cortisol during baseline, reactivity, and recovery to the TSST-C. Youth report of maternal overprotection was associated with lower baseline cortisol levels, and a slower cortisol decline during recovery, controlling for maternal care, puberty, and gender. No additive or interactive effects involving maternal care emerged. These findings suggest that maternal overprotection may exert a unique and important influence on youth's stress response."
Trajectories of self-evaluation bias in primary and secondary school: Parental antecedents and academic consequences,2017,"Using a longitudinal approach spanning nine years of 's formal education, this  investigated the developmental trajectories of self-evaluation bias of academic competence. The   examined how   were associated with the trajectories of bias in mid-primary school, and how those trajectories predicted academic outcomes at the end of secondary school and the beginning of college. A total of 711  in 4th and 5th grades (mean age = 10.71 years old; 358 girls) participated in this . Using a latent class growth modeling framework,  indicated that  can be classified in three latent growth trajectories of self-evaluation bias: the optimistic, realistic and pessimistic trajectories. These trajectories differed in their initial status of bias and  in their development over time. Children's adherence to a specific trajectory was associated with  variables in hood. Finally, the optimistic, realistic, or pessimistic trajectories distinctively predicted achievement and persistence. (C) 2017 Society for the Study of School Psychology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The Apple of Daddy's Eye: Parental Overvaluation Links the Narcissistic Traits of Father and Child,2020,"This  contributes to the literature on the al correlates of 's narcissism. It addresses whether al overvaluation may drive the putative link between s' narcissism and 's narcissism and self-esteem. The cross-sectional design involved a community sample of 519 school-age  (age ranging from 9 to 11 years old) and their s from an Italian urban context. Child-reported measures included narcissistic traits and self-esteem, while -reported measures included narcissistic traits and overvaluation, as well as  . A series of structural equation models, run separately for mothers and fathers, showed that both s' narcissism was directly and positively related to overvaluation and the 's narcissistic traits; overvaluation partially mediated the indirect link between the fathers' and 's narcissistic traits. None of the - dimensions were related to the 's outcomes, with the exception of the mothers' positive  being directly and positively related to 's self-esteem. These findings shed new light upon the al correlates of  narcissism by suggesting that mothers and fathers convey their narcissism to their offspring through differential pathways. Our findings may be understood from universal as well as cultural specifics regarding the  roles of mothers and fathers. Clinical implications for the treatment of youth narcissism suggest the potential of targeting not only  but  their s."
"Relations among perceived parental rearing behaviors, attachment style, and worry in anxious ",2008,"The   extended the findings of Muris et al. [Muris, P., Meesters, C., Merckelbach, H., & Hulsenbeck, P. (2000). Worry in  is related to perceived al rearing and attachment. Behavior Research and Therapy, 38, 487-497] regarding the relations between perceived al rearing behaviors, self-reported attachment , and worry in a community sample to a clinical sample of anxious . Sixty-four  and adolescents, aged 7-18 years, with a primary anxiety disorder completed (a) the EMBU-C, a questionnaire measuring perceptions of al rearing behaviors, (b) a single-item measure of attachment , and (c) an index of worry severity. Findings revealed that  rated al rearing behaviors, particularly al rejection, were positively related to  worry. Self-reported attachment  was  related to worry, such that  who classified themselves as ambivalently attached reported higher levels of worry than did  who classified themselves as securely attached.   and attachment were found to make independent contributions to worry. The  are compared to those from Muris et al.'s community , and implications for future  are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Antecedents of fathers' perception of  behavior at  age 12 months,2020,"This  investigates whether fathers' adverse hood experiences (ACE) and attachment  reported during pregnancy predict fathers' perception of  behavior assessed 12 months postpartum, expressed by the  Stress Index (PSI), Child Domain. Prospective fathers (N = 835) were recruited to The Little in Norway (LiN)  (Moe & Smith) at nine well-baby clinics in Norway, with data collection composed of five time points during pregnancy and two time points postpartum (6 and 12 months). The main analyses included linear regression, path-analysis modeling, and intraclass correlation based on mixed effects modeling. First, linear regression analyses showed that neither fathers' ACE nor attachment  significantly predicted perceived  behavior postpartum directly. Furthermore, path analyses showed that ACE and less secure attachment  (especially avoidant attachment) measured early in pregnancy strongly predicted negatively perceived  behavior, mediated by fathers' mental health symptoms during pregnancy and partner disharmony postpartum. Second, intraclass correlation analyses showed that fathers' perceived  behavior showed substantial stability between 6 and 12 months postpartum. Family interventions beginning in pregnancy may be most beneficial given that fathers' early experiences and perceptions of attachment in pregnancy were associated with later partner disharmony and stress."
Adolescent-to-Parent Violence: Psychological and Family Adjustment,2020,"Adolescent-to- Violence (APV) or Child-to- Violence (CPV) is a specific form of violence that has remained inconspicuous until recently, but is becoming a mounting social issue and is increasingly the focus of scientific . Of the variables related to APV, the  assessed the characteristics of the family system and its relationship to the psychosocial adjustment of adolescents, an aspect scarcely examined in the literature. Thus, a field  was performed on a community sample of 210 adolescents aged 12-17 years (51.4% girls) who were assessed on measurements of APV,  (al socialization), victimization, and psychological adjustment (personal, family, and school). The  revealed higher rates of psychological APV, and no gender effects in violence exercised against either . The adolescents involved in APV exhibited a greater psychological maladjustment in the different areas under analysis. Moreover, adolescents engaging in psychological APV reported a al socialization  characterized by severe strictness and supervision in comparison to non-aggressors not implicated in psychological APV. Finally, adolescents exercising APV who were victimized by their s showed more psychological, personal, and school maladjustment. These  have implications for needs analysis and the planning of community prevention strategies."
When Do Adolescents Accept or Defy to Maternal Prohibitions? The Role of Social Domain and Communication Style,2017,"Drawing upon both Social-Cognitive Domain Theory and Self-Determination Theory, the goal of the  multi-informant  was to test whether the correlates of maternal prohibitions depend on what is prohibited (i.e., the content of the social domain involved), thereby contrasting moral with friendship prohibitions, as well on how the prohibition is communicated, thereby contrasting an autonomy-supportive with a controlling communication . In a sample of adolescents (N = 196; mean age = 13.9 years; 63 % female) and their mothers (N = 185; mean age = 44 years), we first examined mean-level differences between the two domains in terms of mothers' degree and  of prohibition, as well as on a number of developmental outcomes (i.e., adolescents' legitimacy perceptions, internalization, and oppositional defiance). Both adolescents and mothers reported more maternal involvement in the moral domain (e.g., higher scores for degree of prohibition and controlling communication ). In addition, adolescents reported greater perceived legitimacy and less oppositional defiance in the moral domain (as compared to the friendships domain). Second, we tested whether associations between degree and  of prohibition and the developmental outcomes were moderated by social domain. Whereas associations between degree of prohibition and developmental outcomes either were non-significant or moderated by domain, the associations with communication  were more domain-invariant, with an autonomy-supportive  generally yielding an adaptive pattern of correlates and with a controlling  relating to maladaptive outcomes. The discussion focuses on similarities and differences in the characteristics and correlates of both types of prohibitions."
Parents' Weekly Descriptions of Autonomy Supportive Communication: Promoting Children's Motivation to Learn and Positive Emotions,2015,"Although al autonomy support has been linked to 's intrinsic motivation to learn and positive emotions in numerous studies, there has been little  on interventions to promote al autonomy support, especially in the realm of homework and school related learning. Furthermore, there are relatively few qualitative studies dealing with  autonomy support and 's emotional responses. This qualitative  examined the weekly journals of 15 s who were learning how to promote autonomous motivation and academic enjoyment among their 4th and 5th grade  via autonomy supportive communication. Four themes emerged: generalization beyond homework and school-related learning; s occasionally misinterpreting what it means to be autonomy supportive; strong positive responses, such as  enjoying homework and becoming more passionate about learning; and - shared enjoyment and persistence in the educational games that were provided as a way to practice the autonomy supportive   during each week of the intervention. This  provides insight into how s actually apply autonomy supportive  techniques in the home environment. Future related  education may benefit from these findings; for instance, s may be provided with more examples of how autonomy support can generalize to learning in various domains of life, such as mastering a musical instrument, attending a museum exhibit, ordering books for reading pleasure and learning how to operate a boat safely. Interventions that promote 's autonomous motivation to learn and enjoyment of learning through al autonomy support should be further developed and studied."
Parental practices predict psychological well-being in midlife: life-course associations among women in the 1946 British birth cohort,2010,"Background. Certain   are influential in the emergence of later mental health problems, but less is known about the relationship between   and later psychological well-being. Our aim was to examine the association between well-being in midlife and al behaviour during hood and adolescence, and the role of personality as a possible mediator of this relationship. Method. Data from 984 women in the 1946 British birth cohort  were analysed using structural equation modelling. Psychological well-being was assessed at age 52 years using Ryff's scales of psychological well-being.  practices were recollected at age 43 years using the al Bonding Instrument. Extraversion and neuroticism were assessed at age 26 years using the Maudsley Personality Inventory. Results. In this sample, three   factors were identified : care; non-engagement; control. Higher levels of al care were associated with higher psychological well-being, while higher al non-engagement or control were associated with lower levels of psychological well-being. The effects of care and non-engagement were largely mediated by the offspring's personality, whereas control had direct effects on psychological well-being. The psychological well-being of adult women was at least as strongly linked to the   of their fathers as to that of their mothers, particularly in relation to the adverse effects of non-engagement and control. Conclusions. This  used a prospective longitudinal design to examine the effects of  practices on psychological well-being in midlife. The effects of , both positive and negative, persisted well into mid-adulthood."
Personality and Parenting Styles as Predictors of Self-Regulation in Foreign Language Learning,2011,
THIS IS MY RESPONSIBILITY: PARENTAL EXPERIENCE OF FORMER SOVIET UNION IMMIGRANT PARENTS IN ISRAEL,2016,"This qualitative  focuses on the  experience of immigrant s from the former Soviet Union (FSU) in Israel. Seventeen in-depth open interviews with FSU immigrant s were conducted. All participants had been living in Israel between one-and-a-half and five years and had adolescent  aged 11 to 17. The central theme that emerges from the interviews is the participants' sense of al responsibility, which is based on four central components: control, involvement, discipline, and al guidance. Immigration challenges the participants' abilities to fulfil their responsibilities as s by exposing them and their  to cultural differences in -rearing practices and language difficulties. Pressures of work and learning to live in a new culture may lead to a lack of emotional and physical availability to their . Participants try to cope with these challenges by maintaining -rearing practices used in the FSU. Many s report this means of coping as unsuccessful and feel helpless and uncertain in tackling new al dilemmas posed by immigration."
Assessing Parenting Behaviors in Euro-Canadian and East Asian Immigrant Mothers: Limitations to Observations of Responsiveness,2010,"The use of  measures that are developed for use with Western families without testing their validity among families from non-Western cultural backgrounds may not be appropriate. Similar  behaviors may affect  outcomes in different ways across different cultures. This  examined the cross-cultural validity of an observational Maternal Responsiveness coding system and of self-reports of lax/inconsistent  in Euro-Canadian (n = 23) and East Asian immigrant mothers (n = 23) of 4- to 7-year-old sons. In Euro-Canadian mothers, observed  responsiveness was associated with less lax/inconsistent  and fewer  behavior problems. In East Asian immigrant mothers, however, observations of greater responsiveness were not related to reports of lax/inconsistent , and were associated with greater  behavior problems. Implications for the use of these  measures across culture groups are discussed."
Parenting and 's school achievement: A multiethnic perspective,1998,"The   is an examination of the relations between  and the school performance of fourth- and fifth-grade  (mean age = 10 years 2 months) in 75 Asian-American, 109 Latino, and 91 European-American families. Five aspects of  were studied: (a) expectations for 's educational attainment (b) grade expectations, (c) basic bearing beliefs(i.e., development of autonomy: development of conformity to external standards and importance of monitoring 's activities), (d) self-reported behaviors (i.e., creating an academically enriching environment and helping with homework), and (e) perceptions of al efficacy. School performance was measured by school grades and achievement test scores. Ethnic group differences emerged in s' expectations for 's educational attainment, grade expectations, rearing beliefs, perceptions of al efficacy, and in the relations between these beliefs a,rd 's school achievement. these  provide further evidence of the importance of considering the constellation of s beliefs, goals for their  and the type of help s can offer  when working with s to facilitate their 's school experiences."
Why do ethnic minority (Indian)  living in Britain display more internalizing problems than their English peers? The role of social support and parental style as mediators,2005,"The purpose of this paper was to examine explanatory mechanisms of differences in 's internalizing problems between ethnic minority (i.e., Indian) and ethnic majority (i.e., English)  living in Britain. Fifty-nine English  (31 girls) and 66 Indian  (30 girls), and their s constituted the sample of this . Both mothers and fathers reported on the 's internalizing problems, and provided reports of their own   and social support. Analysis showed that maternal positivity, paternal negativity, and both s' reports of social support mediated the link between ethnicity and internalizing problems. Furthermore, according to the best-fitting structural equation model, ethnicity did not have a direct influence on 's internalizing problems, nor on al . Ethnicity instead predicted al reports of social support. Social support, in turn, contributed to 's internalizing problems directly as well as indirectly through  . Finally, although   significantly influenced 's internalizing problems, social support was a much stronger contributor. The role of the distal as well as the proximal environments on 's adjustment is discussed."
"Sleep problems among Taiwanese  with autism, their siblings and typically developing ",2012,"The current  compared the sleep schedules, sleep problems among  with autism, their siblings and typically developing , and to explore other associated factors with sleep problems. We conducted a case-control  consisting 110  with autistic disorder, 125 unaffected siblings, and 110 age-, sex-, and al education-matched typically developing , aged 4-13 years old. We conducted psychiatric interviews to obtain DSM-IV diagnosis of autistic disorder and confirmed by the Chinese Version of the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised. The mothers were asked to report on the self-administered questionnaires regarding sleep schedules and problems of their  and  . Our  showed that  with autism had more sleep problems, including early insomnia, middle insomnia, sleep-wake schedule disorders and daytime napping. Their unaffected siblings  had more risk of early insomnia, sleep-talking and nightmares, compared to the typically developing  in non-autistic family. We  found an association between bring-up experience and nightmare, and between maternal overprotection and middle insomnia and sleep-wake schedule disorder. The findings of increased risks for sleep problems in both  with autism and their unaffected sibling suggest that  counseling should be included in intervention of sleep problems in  with autism and their siblings.

The treatment group comprised 3,689 primary caregiver s who participated in the SEP and their  clinically diagnosed with acute anxiety symptoms, from 180 schools across 15 cities. Equal number of primary caregiver s and  were assigned to the control group. Results showed that post-test scores of treatment group primary caregiver s were higher on the   questionnaires, indicating an improved and authoritative  . This positive effect of the SEP on  in turn had a mediating effect on resilience of their , who scored higher on the outcome measures in the post-treatment phase.  and resilience outcome measures varied due to socio-economic and SEP-related variables. Children's perception of post-treatment  influenced their resilience. Findings suggest that SEP could aid positive  and hence positive behavioural outcomes in ."
Student disengagement and the socialization styles of high schools,2005,"This paper advances a cross-contextual understanding of authoritative socialization, a concept developed by family ers. Using data from the High School Effectiveness Study, I use multilevel modeling to test the effect of high school socialization  on student disengagement from 10(th) to 12(th) grades, controlling for both the sociodemographic context of schools and student characteristics. I find that school socialization  is differentially associated with student disengagement by 10(th) grade, and controlling for 10(th) grade disengagement, school  have further effects on disengagement by 12(th) grade. As hypothesized, the pattern of effects replicates that found in studies of family socialization authoritative schools have the lowest levels of disengagement and indifferent schools the highest, while authoritarian and permissive schools have moderate levels of disengagement."
DIFFERENTIAL EFFECT OF THE PATERNAL AND MATERNAL PARENTING STYLE IN AGGRESSIVENESS DURING ADOLESCENCE,2016,
And my mama said ... The (relative) parental influence on fear of crime among adolescent girls and boys,2008,"Many studies have been conducted to examine the predictors of fear of crime among adults, but feelings of insecurity among  and adolescents have been practically ignored. The aim of this  is to search for relevant determinants of fear of crime in a reative sample of 1,212 Flemish (Belgian) adolescents, age 14 to 18, and one of their s. The effect of   on the 's level of fear is investigated by means of (multi-group) structural equation modeling. The level of al supervision (especially fathers) is associated with more fears being experienced by . Active al stimulation of participation in organized leisure activities  in lower levels of fear among female . s who focus on independence and autonomy, in contrast, seem to raise boys who have lower degrees of fear. Other findings that relate to fear of crime in adolescence, such as gender differences and socialization, media and leisure patterns, and victimization and personal adjustment, are  discussed."
Early family context and development of adolescent ruminative style: Moderation by temperament,2012,"We know very little about the development of rumination, the tendency to passively brood about negative feelings. Because rumination is a risk factor for many forms of psychopathology, especially depression, such knowledge could prove important for preventing negative mental health outcomes in youth. This  examined developmental origins of rumination in a longitudinal sample (N = 337; 51% girls) studied in preschool (ages 3 1/2 and 4 1/2 years) and early adolescence (ages 13 and 15 years). Results indicated that family context and  temperament, assessed during the preschool period, were risk factors for a ruminative  in adolescence. Specifically, early family contexts characterised by over-controlling  and a family  of negative-submissive expressivity predicted higher levels of later rumination. These associations were moderated by 's temperamental characteristics of negative affect and effortful control. Further, the interaction of these temperament factors exerted an additional influence on later rumination. Implications for prevention and intervention efforts are discussed."
"Relationships between Parental Socialization Styles, Empathy and Connectedness with Nature: Their Implications in Environmentalism",2019,"s exert a strong influence on several adjustment outcomes. However, little is known about their influence on adolescents' connectedness with the environment. This  examined the relationships between  , empathy and connectedness with the environment. The two-dimensional socialization model was used with four ing : Indulgent, authoritative, neglectful and authoritarian. The sample comprised 797 adolescents (52.7% girls) from six public secondary schools who were aged between 12 and 16 years (M = 13.94, SD = 1.28). The  showed significant relationships between al socialization , empathy and connectedness with nature. It was  observed that adolescents from indulgent and authoritative families showed higher levels of empathy and connectedness with the environment than adolescents raised by authoritarian and neglectful s, with males from such families consistently ing the lowest levels of empathy and connectedness, which was not the case among women. Additionally, women, regardless of the al  in which they had been educated, showed greater cognitive and emotional empathy with the natural environment, while adolescents raised in indulgent and authoritative families displayed higher levels of empathy and connectedness than those with authoritarian and neglectful s. These  suggest that indulgent and authoritative  are stronger enablers of empathy and connectedness with nature."
Possible  of extreme parenting: Power of helicopter parenting attitude to predict ego inflation,2020,"The concept of helicopter  is used to describe a al disposition that is excessively -oriented, intrusive and limiting to 's autonomy. It is characterized by s being overly concerned about 's future, making great efforts to avoid possible negative outcomes, preferring to plan and handle 's life and even executing 's tasks in his/her place. The objective of this  is to establish the relation between helicopter al attitudes and ego inflation. The Perceived Helicopter al Attitude Scale and Ego Inflation Scale were applied to 432 people with an age group of 24-34 years. Hypotheses of the  were tested using structural equation modelling after  related to the fit values and factor loads of the scales were determined to be appropriate and adequate. The  found that 42.80 percent of the change in the inflated ego reported in young adults can be explained by a helicopter maternal attitude (R-2 = .43). Helicopter paternal attitude accounted for 22.10 percent of the change in the inflated ego observed in young adults (R-2 = .22). It has, thus, been demonstrated that ego inflation is triggered by helicopter al attitudes and helicopter attitudes of mothers are more successful in creating ego inflation than those of fathers. We hope that the findings of the   can be used in  education and family counselling practices."
Family environment and parenting as predictors of attention-deficit and hyperactivity among Palestinian ,2006,"The prevalence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among 1,000 Palestinian school-age  was studied.

"The resilience scale: factorial structure, reliability, validity, and parenting-related factors among disaster-exposed adolescents",2021,"BackgroundIn this , we examined psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Resilience Scale (RS) and -related factors associated with resilience among disaster-exposed adolescents.MethodsEighteen months after the earthquake, a total of 1266 adolescents (43.4% male, mean age=15.98; SD=1.28) were assessed using the RS, the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Self-Rating Scale, the Depression Self-rating Scale for Children, the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders, and al Bonding Instrument.ResultsThrough exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) and parallel analysis, responses were characterized into a 3-factor structure: personal competence, meaningfulness, and acceptance of self and life. Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the RS was 0.89 and the test-retest reliability coefficient was 0.72. In terms of predictive validity, resilience was found to be a significant predictor for PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Multiple regression analysis showed that maternal   were significant predictors of resilience after adjusting for gender, age, sibling number, and earthquake experiences.ConclusionsThe Chinese version of RS is a reliable and valid tool for assessing resilience among adolescent survivors after disasters. The implications for  and resilience-oriented interventions were  discussed."
Association of food parenting practice patterns with obesogenic dietary intake in Hispanic/Latino youth: Results from the Hispanic Community Children's Health Study/Study of Latino Youth (SOL Youth),2019,"Some food  practices (FPPs) are associated with obesogenic dietary intake in non-Hispanic youth, but studies in Hispanics/Latinos are limited. We examined how FPPs relate to obesogenic dietary intake using cross-sectional data from 1214 Hispanic/Latino 8-16-year-olds and their s/caregivers in the Hispanic Community Children's Health Study/Study of Latino Youth (SOL Youth). Diet was assessed with 2 24-h dietary recalls. Obesogenic items were snack foods, sweets, and high-sugar beverages. Three FPPs (Rules and Limits, Monitoring, and Pressure to Eat) derived from the  strategies for Eating and Activity Scale (PEAS) were assessed. K-means cluster analysis identified 5 groups of s with similar FPP scores. Survey-weighted multiple logistic regression examined associations of cluster membership with diet. s in the controlling (high scores for all FPPs) vs. indulgent (low scores for all FPPs) cluster had a 1.75 (95% CI: 1.02, 3.03) times higher odds of having  with high obesogenic dietary intake. Among s of 12-16-year-olds, membership in the pressuring (high Pressure to Eat, low Rules and Limits and Monitoring scores) vs. indulgent cluster was associated with a 2.96 (95% CI: 1.51, 5.80) times greater odds of high obesogenic dietary intake. All other associations were null. Future longitudinal examinations of FPPs are needed to determine temporal associations with obesogenic dietary intake in Hispanic/Latino youth."
Parental Autonomy Support and Student Learning Goals: A Preliminary Examination of an Intrinsic Motivation Intervention,2011,"In a seven week quasi-experimental , s (n = 15) of elementary school students (n = 15) learned autonomy supportive communication techniques that included helping their  set learning goals for homework assignments. Treatment vs. comparison group (n = 30) ANCOVA analyses revealed that the s in the treatment group perceived their  as becoming more autonomously motivated relative to the comparison group, F(1, 26) = 7.69, p < .05. Children in the treatment group reported increased positive affect toward homework relative to the comparison group, F(1,26) = 5.35, p < .05. Children did not significantly improve on general measures of self reported academic intrinsic motivation or relative autonomy. These preliminary findings suggest that autonomy supportive   may improve 's perceptions of their 's autonomous motivation and 's subjective experience of positive affect surrounding homework. In order to draw firmer conclusions about the effects of the intervention, more rigorously controlled studies will be needed in the future."

These findings suggest that a multidisciplinary, integrated approach addressing both nutrition and  is an effective way to help s guide their  toward healthful eating behaviors."
"Associations between parents' marital functioning, maternal parenting quality, maternal emotion and  cortisol levels",2007,"Associations between family functioning and 's stress hormone levels are explored, by examining how aspects of the interal relationship (s' marital satisfaction and  conflict ), the mother  relationship (maternal involvement and warmth) and maternal emotional functioning (depression, anxiety and self-esteem) relate to 's cortisol levels. s of 63  (32 kindergarten-aged , 31 adolescents) completed questionnaires regarding family and individual functioning, and 's salivary cortisol samples were collected on two consecutive weekdays at home immediately upon waking and at bedtime, such that wakeup, bedtime and average levels and the slope of their diurnal cortisol rhythms could be estimated. Higher marital functioning was significantly and independently associated with lower  cortisol levels (average levels and wakeup levels), while maternal  quality and emotional functioning were not significant when included in the same regression model. Associations between s' marital functioning and 's bedtime cortisol levels and diurnal slopes were moderated by  age, with higher  marital functioning being associated with a significantly greater lowering of bedtime levels and steeper diurnal slopes for kindergarten-aged  as compared to adolescents. Higher maternal  quality was found to be significantly related to steeper diurnal cortisol rhythms."
VALIDATION OF THE PARENTING STYLE SURVEY FOR PARENTS OF CHILDREN WITH MENTAL-RETARDATION,1991,
The association between parenting behaviours and marijuana use based on adolescent age,2015,"Study aims: The purpose of this  was to determine whether youth marijuana use (past year and past month) differed based on the frequency of positive  behaviours. Methods: The   performed a secondary data analysis of the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. A national sample of youth in the United States (N = 17,399) aged 12-17 years completed the survey. Findings: Results indicated 14.3% of students used marijuana in the past year while 7.8% used marijuana in the past month. Neither past year nor past month marijuana use differed based on the sex, but both did differ based on the age. Older students were more likely to have used marijuana than were younger students. Past year and past month use  differed based on the frequency of positive  behaviours. Students at highest risk for use were those with s who never/seldom engaged in positive  behaviours. While frequency of positive  protected all age groups against marijuana use, the protective effect was highest for 12-13 year olds, followed by 14-15 year olds and then 16-17 year olds. Conclusions: Prevention specialists and health educators should consider these findings when developing and implementing efforts to prevent youth involvement in marijuana use."
Teenagers and their parents: Parental time and parenting style - What are the issues?,2007,
The impact of 's internalizing and externalizing problems on parenting:Transactional processes and reciprocal change over time,2015,"Most theoretical models of developmental psychopathology involve a transactional, bidirectional relation between  and 's behavior problems. The   utilized a cross-lagged panel, multiple interval design to model change in bidirectional relations between  and  behavior across successive developmental periods. Two major categories of  behavior problems, internalizing and externalizing, and two aspects of , positive (use of support and structure) and harsh discipline (use of physical punishment), were modeled across three time points spaced 3 years apart. Two successive developmental intervals, from approximately age 7.5 to 10.5 and from 10.5 to 13.5, were included. Mother- dyads (N = 138; 65 boys) from a lower income longitudinal sample of families participated, with standardized measures of mothers rating their own  behavior and teachers reporting on 's behavior. Results revealed different types of reciprocal relations between specific aspects of  and  behavior, with internalizing problems predicting an increase in positive  over time, which subsequently led to a reduction in internalizing problems across the successive 3-year interval. In contrast, externalizing predicted reduced levels of positive  in a reciprocal sequence that extended across two successive intervals and predicted increased levels of externalizing over time. Implications for prevention and early intervention are discussed."
Relationship history and relationship attitudes in gay males and lesbians: attachment style and gender differences,1998,"Objective: The objective of the   was to assess the applicability of attachment theory to the relationships of gay males and lesbians, with particular emphasis on al relationships, relationship satisfaction, sexual attitudes and 'coming out' as being homosexual. Methods: Gay males (n = 77) and lesbians (n = 100) completed questionnaires assessing attachment , working models of attachment, early relationships with s and relationship history, status and functioning. A comparison sample of heterosexual participants completed measures of attachment  and relationship history. Results: Relative frequencies of attachment  were similar for homosexual and heterosexual samples. Contrary to previous  using largely heterosexual respondents, no link between early  and attachment  was found. However, homosexual males reported more positive early relationships with mothers than did females. Associations of attachment  with working models, relationship variables and sexual attitudes largely supported those based on heterosexual samples. Gender and attachment  differences were found in reported effects of 'coming out' on relationships with s. Conclusions: Overall, the  suggest that insecure attachment may not be over-reed in gay and lesbian samples, but that insecurity is associated with less relationship satisfaction and with problems related to the disclosure of sexual orientation. The implications of these findings for  and clinical practice are addressed."
Intergenerational Continuity in Attitudes: A Latent Variable Family Fixed-Effects Approach,2017,"Attitudes are associated with behavior. Adolescents raised by s who endorse particular attitudes are relatively more likely to endorse those same attitudes. The   addresses conditions that would moderate intergenerational continuity in attitudes across 6 domains: authoritative , conventional life goals, gender egalitarianism, deviancy, abortion, and sexual permissiveness. Hypothesized moderators included the attitudes of the other , and adolescent sex. Data come from a 2-generation  of a cohort of 451 adolescents (52% female), a close-aged sibling, and their s. After employing a novel specification in which family fixed-effect models partitioned out variation at the between-family level, hypotheses were tested on the within-family variance. Unlike typical family fixed-effect models, this specification accounted for measurement error.

"Bullying and victimization: Predictive role of individual, parental, and academic factors",2013,"This  explored the roles of individual factors (age, gender, locus of control, self-esteem, and loneliness),  , and academic achievement in discriminating students involved in bullying (as bullies, victims, and bully/victims) from those not involved. Participants comprised 742 middle school students (393 females, 349 males). The  of multinomial logistic regression analysis indicated that a higher locus of control, lower strictness/supervision scores, increased age, and being male increased the likelihood of being a bully; a higher locus of control, higher loneliness score, and a lower acceptance/involvement score increased the likelihood of being a victim; and higher loneliness and psychological autonomy scores and lower acceptance/involvement, strictness/supervision, and academic achievement scores increased the likelihood of being a bully/victim. Although al  variables play an important role in involvement in bullying, the individual factor loneliness is a more powerful predictor than other predictors in discriminating victims and bully/victims from uninvolved students. Age and gender are stronger predictors than other predictors in discriminating bullies from uninvolved students."
All in the family: A simultaneous model of parenting style and  conduct,2002,
Association between parental negligence in feeding and social activity of obese adults among jazan population,2020,"Background: Neglectful feeding and physical activity (PA) practices by s are associated with development of adulthood obesity. The Arab world has reported an alarming increase of adulthood obesity and hood neglect by s, yet have not studied the association between the two variables. Aims: The objectives of this  were to evaluate two al negligence parameters (feeding  and social activity) associated with adulthood obesity and to identify the level of al negligence on a customized  neglect scale. Methods: In total 450 adult subjects 18-30 were screened for body mass index (BMI) values. 240 subjects fulfilling the criteria for the  were divided into two groups normal weight (N Gp) (n = 150) and overweight/obese (Ov/Ob Gp) (n = 90) groups. A questionnaire was formulated through a dual moderator focus group discussion, which was then tested in a prepilot and a pilot  (qualitative) to determine its validity (content and criterion) and reliability (repeated measurement) before distributing to the s of both groups. Physical activity and screen time were  recorded for the subjects and their s. Chi square test for association/difference between two categorical variables and Pearsons correlation coefficient for BMI correlation were employed. Results:  parameters like maternal age, consanguineous marriage, breastfeeding duration, formula food introduction, and maternal smoking were significantly different between studied groups. Higher physical inactivity was observed among s (father/mother 53%) and subjects (80%). The higher amount of screen time (73% >= 60-100 h/week) was found in the Ov/Ob Gp that significantly differed with the other group. Maternal BMI was positively related to the subjects BMI. s of obese subjects were found negligent in feeding  and very negligent for social activity on a  neglect scale as compared to the s of the normal weight subjects. Conclusion: s are responsible for developing healthy eating habits and competitive social behavior among their . s need to practice the same to influence changes in their  during their early hood, as well as when their  grow into adults. Negligent  in the studied parameters were found to increase the risk of developing adulthood obesity and should be considered as a potential marker for adult obesity."
"Use of alcohol, tobacco, cannabis and other drugs in adolescence: Effects of family and neighborhood.",2015,"The aim of this  was to analyze the protective or risk factors of al educational  for the consumption of alcohol, tobacco, cannabis and other drugs, considering the interaction of   with the dangerousness of the neighborhood. Based on the responses of 628 adolescents, 369 females (58.8%) and 259 males (41.2%) between 15 and 17 years old (M = 16.03 years old, SD = 0.79 years old), families were classified according to their educational  (authoritative, indulgent, authoritarian or neglectful) and their level of perceived neighborhood risk (high or low). Results showed no interaction effect; however, main effects of educational  and perceived neighborhood risk were obtained. Adolescents from indulgent families showed the lowest consumption in the substances evaluated, while those from authoritative, authoritarian and neglectful families showed the highest consumption. Moreover, adolescents from high-risk neighborhoods obtained the highest consumption. Indulgent educational , acting primarily through affection and not imposition, works as a protective factor regardless of the danger in the neighborhood. The importance of encouraging this al performance in prevention and intervention programs is highlighted, promoting specific educational strategies to improve affection, communication and al involvement."
"Ideas about parenting in Argentina, France, and the United States",1996,"Central to a concept of culture is the expectation that different peoples possess different ideas and behave in different ways with respect to  rearing. In this , we investigated ideas that Argentine, French, and US American mothers hold about their own and their husbands' actual  rearing, as well as what they consider to be ideal  rearing, in three  domains: social, didactic, and limit setting. For each domain, we analysed mothers' reports of their actual behaviours and of their husbands' actual behaviours; mothers' ideal expectations of their own and their husbands' behaviours; and mothers' dissonance with respect to  (i.e. the extent to which mothers' actual and their husbands' actual behaviours each agrees with mothers' ideal expectations for themselves and for their husbands).

Associations of maternal influences with outdoor play and screen time of two-year-olds: Findings from the Healthy Beginnings Trial,2014,"Aim: This  aims to investigate if maternal influences are associated with 's outdoor playtime and screen time at the age of 2 years. Methods: A cross-sectional  with 497 first-time mothers and their  was conducted using the data from the Healthy Beginnings Trial undertaken in Sydney, Australia during 2007-2010. Maternal influences included their own physical activity and screen time, television rules for their , perceived neighbourhood environment, al self-efficacy and   (warmth and hostility). Children's outdoor playtime, screen time and maternal influences were collected through face-to-face interviews with participating mothers when the  were 2 years old. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the associations between maternal influences and 's outdoor play and screen time. Results: Mothers with low levels of al hostility and high perceived safe outdoor play environment were more likely to have  playing outdoor for = 2 h/day with adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.65 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.68-4.20, P < 0.0001) and AOR 2.44 (95% CI 1.85-3.85, P < 0.0001) respectively. Mothers' own screen time was the sole factor associated with 's screen time (AOR 1.90 (95% CI 1.29-2.81, P = 0.001)). Conclusion: Different maternal influences were independently associated with 's outdoor play or screen time at an early stage of life. Therefore, different intervention strategies are needed to increase 's outdoor playtime and decrease their screen time."
Peer relations in adolescence: Effects of parenting and adolescents' self-concept,1997,"In this  we examined the link between the -adolescent relationship and the adolescent's relationship with peers. The proposed model assumes that the quality of the - relationship affects the adolescent's self-concept, which in turn affects the adolescent's integration into the world of peers. The sample consisted of 508 families with adolescents (12- to 18-years-old). The data were obtained at the subjects' homes, where a battery of questionnaires was administered individually to mothers, fathers and adolescents. Several constructs relating to the quality of the - relationship were assessed: al acceptance, attachment, involvement, responsiveness, love withdrawal and monitoring of the . The measures of the adolescent's self-concept included Harter's Perceived Competence Scale for Adolescents and Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale. The indicators of the quality of peer relations were: degree of peer activity, having a best friend, perceived acceptance by peers and attachment to peers. Assessment of the hypothesized model showed that the adolescent's self-concept serves a mediating role in the relationship between maternal -rearing  and involvement with peers. The mediating role of self-concept was greatest for maternal acceptance. Paternal -rearing , however, appeared to have an independent effect on the adolescent's involvement with peers that is not accounted for by the adolescent's self concept. The prediction of the quality of adolescents' peer relations yielded similar  for both mothers and fathers. The  suggest that a positive self-concept and warm supportive  each contribute unique variance to satisfactory peer relations.

Mothers and toddlers lunch together. The relation between observed and reported behavior,2011,"Many factors are acknowledged as contributing to the current hood obesity crisis, with the role of   having recently come under scrutiny as ers have begun to apply behavioral concepts like control and permissiveness to the context of feeding. In the  , 20 mothers (10 overweight, 10 normal weight) and their 2-year-old offspring were observed eating a lunch under laboratory conditions. Mothers additionally provided demographic information and completed questionnaires regarding weight concerns and feeding . Overweight mothers were more concerned about their own weight relative to normal weight mothers but they showed no difference in their feeding behavior nor in their feeding behavior toward their . Apart from maternal weight, however, aspects of maternal feeding , namely observed and self-reported restriction and self-reported pressure, were associated with toddler Body Mass Index.

Parental discipline behaviours and beliefs about their : associations with  internalizing and mediation relationships,2009,"Introduction Internalizing disorders of hood are a common and disabling problem, with sufferers at increased risk of subsequent psychiatric morbidity. Several studies have found associations between   and 's internalizing, although few have considered the role of al discipline. al discipline  may exert an effect on 's internalizing symptoms. Anxiety and depression are reliably found to run in families and al anxiety has been shown to effect  behaviour. This  set out to examine the links between al anxiety, al discipline  and  internalizing symptoms. Method Eighty-eight s of  aged 4-10 years were recruited through primary schools. All s completed questionnaires including measures relating to: adult anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - Trait version, Penn State Worry Questionnaire), al depression (Beck Depression Inventory - Fastscreen), al discipline (The  Scale), -related attributions ( Attitudes, Beliefs and Cognitions Scale) and  psychological morbidity (Child Behaviour Checklist 4-18 version). Results Significant correlations were found between both al anxiety and  internalizing symptoms with ineffective discipline and negative beliefs about . Particularly strong correlations were found between al anxiety and  internalizing symptoms with harsh discipline. s of anxious/withdrawn  were more likely to hold negative beliefs about their . The link between al anxiety and  internalizing symptoms was mediated by harsh discipline. The link between al anxiety and harsh discipline was mediated by al beliefs about the .

Ninety-eight (98) practicing counselors, social workers, psychiatrists, and psychologists rated two videotaped family interviews. One interview demonstrated a matriarchal  of family interaction and the second demonstrated a patriarchal . It was found in perceptions of family functioning that participants perceived the mother-led family to be less healthy than the father-led family. Their views of the families, however, were not found to be related to personal attitudes or family history. In the assessment of individual family member functioning, it was found that participants viewed the father in the patriarchal family to be more healthy than the father in the matriarchal family. It was  found that a personal family history characterized by elevated al control combined with attitudes that favored elevated al control of  was related to the perception that the members of the patriarchal family were more healthy than the matriarchal family members. These findings suggest that in the practice of couples and family therapy, personal family history and attitudes regarding  may be significant factors in clinician gender role expectations and standards."
Circle of Security-Parenting: A randomized controlled trial in Head Start,2017,"Although evidence shows that attachment insecurity and disorganization increase risk for the development of psychopathology (Fearon, Bakermans-Kranenburg, van IJzendoorn, Lapsley, & Roisman, 2010; Groh, Roisman, van IJzendoorn, Bakermans-Kranenburg, & Fearon, 2012), implementation challenges have precluded dissemination of attachment interventions on the broad scale at which they are needed. The Circle of Security- Intervention (COS-P; Cooper, Hoffman, & Powell, 2009), designed with broad implementation in mind, addresses this gap by training community service providers to use a manualized, video-based program to help caregivers provide a secure base and a safe haven for their . The   is a randomized controlled trial of COS-P in a low-income sample of Head Start enrolled  and their mothers. Mothers (N = 141; 75 intervention, 66 waitlist control) completed a baseline assessment and returned with their  after the 10-week intervention for the outcome assessment, which included the Strange Situation. Intent to treat analyses revealed a main effect for maternal response to  distress, with mothers assigned to COS-P reporting fewer unsupportive (but not more supportive) responses to distress than control group mothers, and a main effect for one dimension of  executive functioning (inhibitory control but not cognitive flexibility when maternal age and marital status were controlled), with intervention group  showing greater control. There were, however, no main effects of intervention for  attachment or behavior problems. Exploratory follow-up analyses suggested intervention effects were moderated by maternal attachment  or depressive symptoms, with moderated intervention effects emerging for  attachment security and disorganization, but not avoidance; for inhibitory control but not cognitive flexibility; and for  internalizing but not externalizing behavior problems. This initial randomized controlled trial of the efficacy of COS-P sets the stage for further exploration of what works for whom in attachment intervention."

It is considered that Prosocial Behavior arises from a social demand due to the increase of aggressive and criminal manifestations. Several es attempt to answer the question of how human beings can be socialized to become a positive member of their communities, concluding that the prosocial and aggressive behavior are extremes of behavior modulated by cognitive and emotional processes in which   contributes to its development. Finally, assume prosociality as a tool for preventing violence, involves generating factors that influence its appearance."

Here, the first double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject experiment with intranasal oxytocin administration to fathers of  with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is ed. Fathers with their typically developing toddler (n = 18), and fathers of toddlers diagnosed with ASD (n = 14), were observed in two play sessions of 15 min each with an intervening period of 1 week. In all fathers oxytocin elevated the quality of paternal sensitive play: fathers stimulated their  in a more optimal way, and they showed less hostility which suggests the positive effects of oxytocin on paternal sensitive play irrespective of clinical status of their ."
Is Autonomy-Supportive Parenting Beneficial Only to Adolescents With an Autonomous Personality? Two Meanings of Goodness of Fit,2020,"Although autonomy-supportive  yields manifold benefits for adolescents' development, there is a dearth of  addressing the question of whether adolescents reap the benefits of this  , irrespective of their personality. Accordingly, this  examined whether associations between perceived maternal autonomy support and adolescent well-being depend on adolescents' dispositional motivational orientations. Further, we examined whether associations between perceived maternal autonomy support and wellbeing are accounted for by adolescents' subjective experiences of goodness of fit. A multi-informant three-wave longitudinal  (N = 198 at T1, 51% female, M age = 15 years) was used, allowing for an analysis of the associations both at the level of between-person differences and within-person changes. Adolescents' motivational orientations did not moderate associations between maternal autonomy support and well-being. Multilevel structural equation modeling showed that experiences of goodness of fit played an intervening role in associations between maternal autonomy support and adjustment. The discussion focuses on different meanings of the goodness-of-fit concept."
Financial Identity- Processing Styles Among Young Adults: A Longitudinal Study of Socialization Factors and Consequences for Financial Capabilities,2013,"Using identity theory as a basis for conceptualizing and clustering the financial identity-processing  of young adults, this  examines antecedent socialization factors and consequent financial capabilities associated with those clusters. Using two-timed longitudinal surveys (N=1,511) of college students, we proposed and confirmed three financial identity-processing , resembling Berzonsky's three identity-processing  (i.e., informational, normative, and diffused-avoidant). Labeled Pathfinders, Followers and Drifters: these three clusters were profiled with respect to their socialization factors and financial capabilities. We concluded that identity theory can be applied to the financial domain, financial identity-processing  are influenced by socialization factors (e.g., s, learning), and these  have consequences for individuals' financial capabilities (financial knowledge, self-efficacy, attitudes, and behaviors). Insights from this  may inform the design and implementation of effective financial , financial education and intervention programs, and identify those young adults who may benefit from education and intervention efforts."
Important Non-parental Adults and Positive Youth Development Across Mid- to Late-Adolescence: The Moderating Effect of Parenting Profiles,2014,"Both s and important non-al adults have influential roles in promoting positive youth development (PYD). Little , however, has examined the simultaneous effects of both s and important non-al adults for PYD. We assessed the relationships among youth-reported  profiles and important non-al adult relationships in predicting the Five Cs of PYD (competence, confidence, connection, character, and caring) in four cross-sectional waves of data from the 4-H Study of PYD (Grade 9: N = 975, 61.1 % female; Grade 10: N = 1,855, 63.4 % female; Grade 11: N = 983, 67.9 % female; Grade 12: N = 703, 69.3 % female). The  indicated the existence of latent profiles of youth-reported   based on maternal warmth, al school involvement, and al monitoring that were consistent with previously identified profiles (authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and uninvolved) as well as reflecting several novel profiles (highly involved, integrative, school-focused, controlling).  profile membership predicted mean differences in the Five Cs at each wave, and  moderated the relationships between the presence of an important non-al adult and the Five Cs. In general, authoritative and highly involved  predicted higher levels of PYD and a higher likelihood of being connected to an important non-al adult. We discuss the implications of these findings for future  on adult influences of youth development and for programs that involve adults in attempts to promote PYD."
Patterns of Risk and Protective Factors in the Intergenerational Cycle of Maltreatment,2009,"This  investigates the continuation and discontinuation of the intergenerational transmission of  maltreatment within the first 13 months of the 's life. Differences in risk factors and   between families who initiate (Initiators), maintain (Maintainers) or break (Cycle Breakers) the intergenerational cycle of  maltreatment are explored in comparison to control families (Controls). One hundred and three Health Visitors were trained to assess risk factors and   of 4,351 families, at both 4-6 weeks and 3-5 months after birth. Maintainers, Initiators and Cycle Breakers had a significantly higher prevalence for the majority of risk factors and poor   than Controls. Protective factors of financial solvency and social support distinguished Cycle Breakers from Maintainers and Initiators. Therefore, it is the presence of protective factors that distinguish Cycle Breakers from families who were referred to Child Protection professionals in the first year after birth. A conceptual, hierarchical model that considers history of abuse, risk and protective factors, in turn, is proposed to assess families for the potential of  maltreatment."
Paternal and maternal bonding styles in hood are associated with the prevalence of chronic pain in a general adult population: the Hisayama Study,2015,"Background: Previous  has suggested that extraordinary adverse experiences during hood, such as abuse, are possible risk factors for the development of chronic pain. However, the relationship between the perceived al bonding  during hood and chronic pain has been much less studied. Methods: In this cross-sectional , 760 community-dwelling Japanese adults were asked if they had pain that had been  for six months or more. They completed the al Bonding Instrument (PBI), a self-administrated questionnaire designed to assess perceived al bonding, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 to assess current depressive symptoms. The PBI consists of care and overprotection subscales that are analyzed by assigning the al bonding  to one of four quadrants: Optimal bonding (high care/low overprotection), neglectful  (low care/low overprotection), affectionate constraint (high care/high overprotection), and affectionless control (low care/high overprotection). Logistic regression analysis was done to estimate the contribution of the al bonding  to the risk of chronic pain, controlling for demographic variables. Results: Compared to the optimal bonding group, the odds ratios (ORs) for having chronic pain were significantly higher in the affectionless control group for paternal bonding (OR: 2.21, 95 % CI: 1.50-3.27) and for maternal bonding (OR: 1.60, 95 % CI: 1.09-2.36). After adjusting for depression, significance remained only for paternal bonding. Conclusion: The  demonstrate that the al bonding  during hood is associated with the prevalence of chronic pain in adults in the general population and that the association is more robust for paternal bonding than for maternal bonding."

"Maternal-fetal bonding among pregnant women at psychosocial risk: The roles of adult attachment style, prenatal parental reflective functioning, and depressive symptoms",2020,"Pregnancy offers a unique period for initiating preventive  interventions. Disturbances in maternal-fetal bonding may indicate suboptimal  and a need for intervention. However, more knowledge is needed on the development of maternal-fetal bonding among at-risk groups. The  aim was to examine psychosocial correlates of maternal-fetal bonding among pregnant women identified to be at risk socially and regarding their mental health. The sample consisted of 78 at-risk pregnant women participating in a perinatal intervention : Godt pa Vej Sammen [A Good Start to Life-an Early Cross-sectorial Intervention]. This  was cross-sectional reporting on the baseline characteristics of the participants. In the beginning of the second trimester, participants completed questionnaires assessing maternal-fetal bonding (the Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale [MAAS]), prenatal al reflective functioning, adult attachment , and depressive symptoms. We compared the distribution of MAAS  with norms from a recent Dutch community sample. In addition, we tested associations between psychosocial variables and the quality and intensity of MAAS scores in regression models and performed Chi-square analyses to assess the association of MAAS  with psychosocial variables. First, compared to women from a community sample, approximately half of the women in our sample ed lower and suboptimal MAAS scores. Second, insecure avoidant adult attachment  was negatively associated with MAAS intensity, and depressive symptoms were negatively associated with MAAS quality. Third, prenatal al reflective functioning positively correlated with both quality and intensity of MAAS. Fourth, we found no association between insecure anxious adult attachment  and MAAS scores. Fifth, women with a negative disinterested MAAS  demonstrated the highest avoidant attachment scores, while women with a positively preoccupied MAAS  demonstrated the highest prenatal al reflective functioning scores. The  suggest that there is a need to differentiate among at-risk pregnant woman and that prenatal screening using the MAAS may help identify those who need preventive  interventions and what those interventions should focus on. A main limitation of the  is the lack of a reative group of at-risk pregnant women which limits the generalizability of the   to all risk groups."
Feeding Practices and Styles Used by a Diverse Sample of Low-income Parents of Preschool-age Children,2010,"Objective: To describe the feeding practices and  used by a diverse sample of low-income s of preschool-age . Design: Thirty- to 60-minute meetings involving a semistructured interview and 2 questionnaires administered by the interviewer. Setting: Low-income communities in Philadelphia, PA. Participants: Thirty-two s of 2- to 6-year-old . Phenomena of Interest: The feeding practices and  of low-income s of preschoolers. Analysis: Qualitative interviews analyzed iteratively following a thematic approach; quantitative data analyzed using nonparametric and chi-square tests. Results: Qualitative analyses revealed s used a myriad of feeding practices to accomplish -feeding goals. Racial/ethnic differences were seen; East Asian s used more -focused decision-making processes, whereas black s used more -focused decision-making processes. Quantitative analyses substantiated racial/ethnic differences; black s placed significantly higher demands on  for the amounts (H = 5.89, 2 df, P = .05; Kruskal-Wallis) and types (H = 8.39, 2 df, P = .01; Kruskal-Wallis) of food eaten compared to s of other races/ethnicities. In contrast, significantly higher proportions of East Asian s were classified as having an indulgent feeding  compared to black s and s of other races/ethnicities (chi(2)[4, n = 32] = 9.29, P < .05). Conclusions and Implications: Findings provide support for tailoring nutrition education programs to meet the diverse needs of this target audience."
Autonomy-related Parenting Processes and Adolescent Adjustment in Latinx Immigrant Families,2019,"It is unclear how autonomy-related  processes are associated with Latinx adolescent adjustment. This  uses Latent Profile Analysis to identify typologies of al monitoring and -adolescent conflict and examines their association with Latinx youth's school performance and depressive symptoms. The sample included 248 Latinx 9th and 10th graders (50% female) who completed surveys during fall (Time 1) and spring (Time 2) semesters of the school year. When compared to a high monitoring/low conflict  profile, a moderate monitoring/moderate conflict profile was associated with stronger declines in school performance; for boys, a high monitoring/moderately high conflict profile  was associated with greater increases in depressive symptoms. For Latinx immigrant families, ers should consider monitoring and conflict as co-occurring processes."

"Help Me Play! Parental Behaviors, Child Temperament, and Preschool Peer Play",2014,"Social competence is a critical developmental milestone for preschoolers. Because play is the primary activity through which preschoolers interact socially with peers, it serves as an excellent indicator of social competence. The development of social competence in preschoolers is complex and multifaceted. In order to capture this complexity, we used Belsky's differential susceptibility hypothesis as a framework for examining the contributions of  temperament and   in the prediction of peer interactive play behaviors. Using  ratings of a sample of 44 preschool-age , we hypothesized that  temperament (specifically, reactivity and regulation) acts as a susceptibility factor in the relationship between   (authoritarian and authoritative) and  peer play behaviors (disruptive and interactive). Our findings indicated that  reactivity moderated the relationship between authoritarian   and both play outcomes, suggesting that reactivity serves as a potential susceptibility factor. More specifically,  with high reactivity who had more authoritarian s demonstrated higher levels of disruptive play and lower levels of interactive play. Regulation did not act as a susceptibility factor in our sample. Findings are discussed in terms of implications for practice and in terms of an approach that considers temperament (specifically reactivity) and  behaviors in preschool assessment and intervention efforts. Additionally, we discuss how our findings partially support the differential susceptibility hypothesis."
Parenting issues and attachment orientations: a comparison between Turkey and Bosnia and Herzegovina,,"A growing body of literature links particular  practices with attachment orientations in the Western societies. However, the effects of cultural differences on such linkages have not been adequately addressed in the literature on attachment. Therefore, this  aimed to examine the relationship between -rearing behaviors and adult attachment orientations in Bosnian and Turkish s. 227 s (124 Bosnian and 111 Turkish) aged 25-45 years were selected by multiple cluster sampling method. They filled out the following questionnaires: 'Child Rearing Behaviors Questionnaire' and 'Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised Questionnaire (ECRI II).' The most interesting finding is that the attachment orientations were not a predictor of any rearing behaviors in both countries. These   the consequences of attachment and  issues in non-western societies."
'BERTEHTUH' ENGLISH: THE EXPERIENCE OF A TEMIAR GIRL IN ACQUIRING ENGLISH,2016,"Despite being a community that is often associated with the terms 'illiterate', 'marginalised' and 'educationally disadvantaged', certain indigenous students demonstrate positive developments in their second language proficiency (English). This issue creates a centre of attention as it can highlight suggestions to better the education of indigenous people in Malaysia. Having this in mind, a  was conducted in a remote indigenous school situated in the jungle of Banjaran Titiwangsa. In an attempt to investigate why the subject, an indigenous student of the Temiar tribe, is able to demonstrate better language proficiency compared to her classmates, a micro-ethnographic  that employed interviews as its instrument was conducted. Themes are generated through thematic analysis where this  concludes that the following three factors have hugely contributed to her success: (1) positive teacher (2) integrative-instrumental motivation and (3) supportive environment at home. This   highlights conflict in culture between teachers and the indigenous tribe which is a  of the  , practiced by the indigenous s, instead of their culture as claimed by the teacher. This paper brings to the fore the importance of teacher's attitude and  awareness in empowering the process of learning English in this school."

The weight of the evidence from our studies indicates some degree of intergenerational continuity in behavior. We observed that adjacent generations G1 and G2 are similar with respect to their  of  and that adjacent generations G2 and G3 are similar with respect to antisocial behavior. In addition, the G2 's   plays an important role in mediating or transferring the risk of antisocial behavior across the generations. Implications and directions for future  are discussed."
Psychological control and indulgent parenting predict emotional-abuse victimization in romantic relationships,,"The   investigated the effects al psychological control, warmth, and behavioral control have on emotional-abuse victimization in romantic relationships. Two hundred and thirty university students who had been in a romantic relationship for at least six months completed the  Styles Questionnaire, the Earlier Abuse Experience Information Form, and the Emotional Abuse Questionnaire. Moderation analysis indicated that the three-way interaction between mother's psychological control, warmth, and behavioral control in regard to emotional abuse was significant. More specifically, mother's psychological control predicted emotional-abuse victimization when warmth was both moderate and high while behavioral control was low. These findings indicate that, when s do not provide sufficient behavioral control and monitoring of inappropriate behaviors during hood, al warmth exacerbates the negative effects psychological control has on emotional-abuse victimization in the romantic relationships of late adolescents. The   significantly contributes to developing an understanding of how perceived hood experiences of al psychological control and al attitudes are transferred to late adolescence and consequently could be a risk factor for adolescents' experiences of emotional abuse in their romantic relationships."
Parental styles and long-term outcome following treatment for anxiety disorders,2004,"Poor  has long been associated with the diagnosis of anxiety and mood disorders, but it is not clear whether perceived  can predict long-term outcome following treatment. The shortened al Bonding Instrument (PBI) was examined in respect to outcome, 3-14 years after initial treatment, in a group of patients having an original diagnosis of generalized anxiety, panic or post-traumatic stress disorder. All patients had been entered into one of six controlled clinical treatment trials between 1985 and 1999, which had compared cognitive behavioural therapy with other forms of treatment including psychotherapy, medication and placebo. Significantly lower levels of paternal care and higher levels of al control were reported by patients still having a clinical diagnosis at long-term follow-up compared with those with no diagnosis. In addition, the al  of 'affectionless control' (i.e. low care/high control) from either  was over-reed in those with a diagnosis at long-term follow-up. However, only maternal control was significant for male patients, whilst only paternal care and control were significant for females. Findings on a subgroup of patients, who completed the PBI both pre-treatment and at long-term follow-up, suggest the  are not due to changes in clinical status affecting recall in the recovered patients.

Migration background and the measurement of home-based parental involvement in education: a psychometric evaluation of two self-report questionnaires,,"Home-based al involvement in early education is linked to beneficial outcomes in 's development and may redress unequal educational outcomes associated with family background. The type of educational activities at home and the way s provide their support may differ across s with and without a migration background. It is unclear whether home-based al involvement is measured as the same construct across different origin groups. In this , the psychometric properties of two -report questionnaires on home-based al involvement were evaluated in 131 Dutch mothers of kindergarten-aged , of whom 47% had a migration background. The dimensional structure of both questionnaires was tested with Principal Component Analysis. Multi-group confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to test for measurement invariance of the ' Questionnaire' across migration background. Results supported the multidimensional nature of home-based al involvement, as formal and informal activities formed distinct components in the involvement of this diverse  sample. In addition, measurement invariance was largely confirmed, indicating that 's involvement  can be validly measured across s with and without a migration background in the Dutch context. Incorporating both formal and informal activities with involvement  is recommended when measuring home-based al involvement in different origin groups."
Stepping Stones Triple P: An RCT of a Parenting Program with Parents of a Child Diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disorder,2009,"Whilst the Triple P Positive  Program has a large evidence base (Sanders, Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review 2:71-90, 1999; Sanders, Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology 68:624-640, 2000) and preliminary evidence indicates that Stepping Stones Triple P is  efficacious (Roberts, Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, 35(2):180-193, 2006), to date Stepping Stones has not been evaluated with the ASD population. Fifty-nine families with a  with ASD aged between 2 and 9 participated in this randomized controlled trial.

Early Child Social-Emotional Problems and Child Obesity: Exploring the Protective Role of a Primary Care-Based General Parenting Intervention,2015,"Objective:To determine whether early social-emotional problems are associated with  feeding practices, maternal- feeding , and  obesity at age 5 years, in the context of a primary care-based brief general  intervention led by an integrated behavioral health specialist to offer developmental monitoring, on-site intervention, and/or referrals.Methods:A retrospective cohort  was conducted of mothers with 5-year-old  previously screened using the Ages and Stages Questionnaires: Social-Emotional (ASQ:SE) during the first 3 years of life. ASQ:SE scores were dichotomized not at risk versus at risk. At risk subjects were further classified as participating or not participating in the intervention. Regression analyses were performed to determine relationships between social-emotional problems and feeding practices, feeding , and weight status at age 5 years based on participation, controlling for potential confounders and using not at risk as a reference group.Results:Compared with  not at risk,  at riskno participation were more likely to be obese at age 5 years (adjusted odds ratio, 3.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 9.45). Their mothers were less likely to exhibit restriction and limit setting and more likely to pressure to eat than mothers in the not at risk group. Children at riskparticipation did not demonstrate differences in weight status compared with  not at risk.Conclusion:Early social-emotional problems, unmitigated by intervention, were related to several feeding  and to obesity at age 5 years. Further  is needed to understand how a general  intervention may be protective against obesity."
Factors Linking Childhood Experiences to Adult Romantic Relationships Among African Americans,2014,"It is well known that a high-quality relationship with a romantic partner is related to a variety of positive outcomes associated with health and well-being. Establishing such relationships is an important developmental task for young adults, and past  indicates that there is a link between experiences in the family of origin and the success of later intimate relationships. It has been suggested that this association can be explained by the acquisition of social competencies (e.g., emotions, schemas, traits) that are acquired during hood in the family of origin and, in turn, influence interaction with adult romantic partners. The current  builds on this foundation by identifying particular competencies expected to explain the association between hood exposure to supportive and harsh  and later patterns of interaction with romantic partners. Specifically, we examine anger management, attachment , hostile attribution bias, and self-control as potential mediators using prospective, longitudinal data from a sample of 345 African American young adults. Results from structural equation modeling indicate that each of the mediators in our  accounts for a significant portion of the effect of  on the quality of adult romantic relationships, although the constructs linking  to warm interactions with romantic partners are somewhat different from those that link  to hostile interactions with romantic partners. Even after accounting for the effect of the mediators, there is still a direct effect of  on both warm/loving and hostile/aggressive interactions with romantic partner. Implications for theory and practice are discussed."
What's parenting got to do with it: emotional autonomy and brain and behavioral responses to emotional conflict in  and adolescents,2018,"Healthy  may be protective against the development of emotional psychopathology, particularly for  reared in stressful environments. Little is known, however, about the brain and behavioral mechanisms underlying this association, particularly during hood and adolescence, when emotional disorders frequently emerge. Here, we demonstrate that psychological control, a  strategy known to limit socioemotional development in , is associated with altered brain and behavioral responses to emotional conflict in 27 at-risk (urban, lower income) youth, ages 9-16. In particular, youth reporting higher al psychological control demonstrated lower activity in the left anterior insula, a brain area involved in emotion conflict processing, and submitted faster but less accurate behavioral responsespossibly reflecting an avoidant pattern. Effects were not replicated for al care, and did not generalize to an analogous nonemotional conflict task. We  find evidence that behavioral responses to emotional conflict bridge the previously reported link between al overcontrol and anxiety in . Effects of psychological control may reflect a   that limits opportunities to practice self-regulation when faced with emotionally charged situations. Results support the notion that  strategies that facilitate appropriate amounts of socioemotional competence and autonomy in  may be protective against social and emotional difficulties."
Dysfunctional Parent-Child Communication About Sexting During Adolescence,,"Sexting (sending, receiving, and forwarding nude, semi-nude, or sexually explicit content) entails risks for adolescents; therefore, it is important for s to be able to communicate with their  about its implications. The goal of the   was to identify al characteristics that lead to dysfunctional communication (lower quality of communication) about sexting, on a sample of 427 s (336 mothers and 91 fathers) of Israeli adolescents aged 10-18 years and to determine whether s' perceived severity of sexting and the degree to which they perceive their adolescent to be susceptible to sexting function as mediating factors. s completed a set of questionnaires online. Findings indicated that authoritarian and permissive   were positively associated with dysfunctional - communication about sexting. Authoritative  was inversely related to dysfunctional communication and was mediated by positive attitudes toward sex education. Additionally, authoritative s were capable of assessing the severity of their 's sexting activities, and the degree to which their  were susceptible to engage in sexting. The quality of the discussion initiated by authoritative s appears to have enabled them to be aware of adolescent behaviors and to adjust their communication about the inherent risks. Findings suggest that the perception of sexting as too risky diminishes s' ability to conduct a high-quality discussion about it. In conclusion,  findings emphasize s' role in mediation of the online experiences of their  and conducting a constructive discussions with them about sexting."
Are They Listening? Parental Social Coaching and Parenting Emotional Climate Predict Adolescent Receptivity,2016,"Associations linking  emotional climate and quality of al social coaching with young adolescents' receptivity to al social coaching were examined (N = 80).  emotional climate was assessed with adolescent-reported al warmth and hostility. Quality of al social coaching (i.e., prosocial advice, benign framing) was assessed via -report and behavioral observations during a -adolescent discussion about negative peer evaluation. An adolescent receptivity latent variable score was derived from observations of adolescents' behavior during the discussion, change in adolescents' peer response plan following the discussion, and adolescent-reported tendency to seek social advice from the .  climate moderated associations between coaching and receptivity: Higher quality coaching was associated with greater receptivity in the context of a more positive climate. Analyses suggested a stronger association between coaching and receptivity among younger compared to older adolescents."
The inter-generational transmission of eating disorders,1998,"A self-perpetuating cycle has been implicated between early hood feeding problems and later eating disorders; between al management  and eating disorders in the ; and between the way a mother was raised and her own  behaviour. Questionnaires were distributed to all nurseries in a discrete area of the West Midlands, to elicit information about both nursery-school 's eating behaviour, and the earing attitudes and management  of their primary caregiver. Comparisons were made between the eating behaviour of  whose caregiver showed evidence of abnormal eating attitudes, as demonstrated by their scores on BITE and EAT-26, and that of a control group, drawn From the same population. Food refusal and fussiness were hypothesized to be orthogonal dimensions of earing behaviour in the . Food refusal significantly correlated with the management  of mealtimes when there was evidence of disordered eating in the caregiver, and co-varied with the caregiver's eating attitudes. Food fussiness was seen to be relatively stable across groups, but correlated with the management  of caregivers. This supports the hypothesis that food refusal and food fussiness are distinct behaviours, rather than degrees of the same behaviour.

"Psychosocial Adolescent Psychosocial Adjustment in Brazil - Perception of Parenting Style, Stressful Events and Violence",2014,"The objective of this  was to investigate the association between measures of exposure to violence, stressful events, family socialization practices, and demographic characteristics in a group of adolescents from a Southern region of Brazil. Three hundred adolescents were investigated in a case-control . The  showed that adolescents with emotional and behavioral problems had significant higher stressful events, violence exposure, and negative al practices, compared with controls. However, exposure to violence was the most deteriorating condition associated with the adolescents' clinical internalization and externalization behaviors. Findings suggest the benefit of targeting actions geared to strengthen the quality of family interactions as well as to implement preventive programs to reduce community violence impact and to enhance support in the community."
Home Food Environment in Relation to Children's Diet Quality and Weight Status,2014,"The objective of this cohort  was to explore relationships among the home food environment (HFE), / characteristics, diet quality, and measured weight status among 699 - pairs from King County, WA, and San Diego County, CA. HFE variables included  /feeding practices, food rules, frequency of eating out, home food availability, and s' perceptions of food costs. Child dietary intake was measured by 3-day recall and diet quality indicators included fruits and vegetables, sweet/savory snacks, high-calorie beverages, and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score. Individual linear regression models were run in which  BMI z score and  diet quality indicators were dependent variables and HFE variables and / characteristics were independent variables of interest. Fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with al encouragement/modeling (beta=.68, P<0.001) and unhealthful food availability (-0.27, P<0.05); DASH score with food availability (healthful: 1.3, P<0.01; unhealthful: 2.25, P<0.001), food rules (0.45, P<0.01), and permissive feeding  (-1.04, P<0.05): high-calorie beverages with permissive feeding  (0.14, P<0.01) and unhealthful food availability (0.21, P<0.001); and sweet/savory snacks with healthful food availability (0.26, P<0.05; unexpectedly positive). Children's BMI z score was positively associated with 's use of food restriction (0.21, P<0.001), permissive feeding  (0.16, P<0.05), and concern for healthy food costs (0.10, P<0.01), but negatively with verbal encouragement/modeling (-0.17, P<0.05), and pressure to eat (-0.34, P<0.001). Various HFE factors associated with  around eating and food availability are related to  diet quality and weight status. These factors should be considered when designing interventions for improving  health."
My  at mealtime: A visually enhanced self-assessment of feeding styles for low-income parents of preschoolers,2016,"The importance of caregiver feeding  on 's dietary outcomes is well documented.

"Maternal depression, stress and feeding styles: towards a framework for theory and  in  obesity",2015,"Against the background of rising rates of obesity in  and adults in the USA, and modest effect sizes for obesity interventions, the aim of the  narrative review paper is to extend the UNICEF care model to focus on hood obesity and its associated risks with an emphasis on the emotional climate of the - relationship within the family. Specifically, we extended the UNICEF model by applying the systems approach to hood obesity and by combining previously unintegrated sets of literature across multiple disciplines including developmental psychology, clinical psychology and nutrition. Specifically, we modified the extended care model by explicitly integrating new linkages (i.e. al feeding , stress, depression and mother's own eating behaviour) that have been found to be associated with the development of 's eating behaviours and risk of hood obesity. These new linkages are based on studies that were not incorporated into the original UNICEF model, but suggest important implications for hood obesity. In all, this narrative review offers important advancements to the scientific understanding of familial influences on 's eating behaviours and hood obesity. British Journal of Nutrition"
Association of Parental Warmth and Harsh Discipline With Developmental Trajectories of Depressive Symptoms Among Adolescents in Chinese Society,2015,"This article examines the relationship between   and the development of depressive symptoms among adolescents. We analyzed a nationally reative longitudinal data set of adolescents aged 12 to 14 in Taiwan. Results from growth mixture modeling revealed a nonlinear increase in the intensity of depressive symptoms between early and middle adolescence. More pronounced depressive symptoms in earlier years were  shown to be associated with more rapid development of similar symptoms later in adolescence. Perceived  , as manifest in al warmth and harsh discipline, were categorized into 4 latent heterogeneous classes: attentive, reserved, austere, and conflicting. Adolescents living under austere  tend to report the most pronounced depressive symptoms from early to middle adolescence; however, the development of symptoms in this group was the slowest. We  discuss the role of harsh  in Chinese culture, as it pertains to the roles traditionally assumed by the father and mother."
Exploring differences in perceptions of  feeding practices between parents and health care professionals: a qualitative study,2021,"BackgroundEvidence on  feeding practice is often based on the perspectives and experiences of s and less that of health practitioners. In this , we explored  feeding practice in Aboriginal communities in northern Australia from both the s and health practitioners' perspectives with the aim of informing nutrition improvement programs.MethodsQualitative  methods were employed. Using semi-structured interviews, s (n=30) of  aged 2-5years, and 29 service providers who were involved in the delivery of  health and nutrition programs in the same communities, were asked about  feeding attitudes and practices. Responses were analyzed through inductive and deductive analysis, recognizing that worldviews influence  feeding practices.ResultsSharing food was a central practice within families. s highly valued development of  independence in food behavior but were conflicted with the easy access to unhealthy food in their communities. This easy access to unhealthy food and inadequate food storage and kitchen facilities for some families were major challenges to achieving optimal diets for  identified by Aboriginal families and service providers. The responsive  of  described by s was often misunderstood by service providers as sub-optimal  when viewed through a dominant western lens.ConclusionsApproaches to support healthy feeding practices and optimal  nutrition require health-enabling food environments. Along with a community-based Aboriginal health workforce, it is paramount that the non-Aboriginal workforce be supported to be reflective of the impact of worldview on their practice, to ensure a culturally safe environment for families where   are understood and appropriately supported."
"Role of Dietary Factors, Food Habits, and Lifestyle in Childhood Obesity Development: A Position Paper From the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition Committee on Nutrition",2021,"Childhood obesity has high societal and economic impact but current treatment approaches are sub-optimal. In the last decade, important studies have been conducted aiming to identify strategies to prevent obesity during critical periods of life. Updated recommendations for hood obesity prevention are needed. We  data from systematic reviews and meta- analysis, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and large observational studies, published from 2011 onwards that consider the possible role of the following factors in obesity development: breast-feeding; macronutrient composition and method of complementary feeding;  ; dietary patterns; sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; eating behaviour (eg, skipping breakfast, family dinners. etc); meal frequency and composition (fast foods, snacking), portion size; dietary modulators of gut microbiota (including pre-, pro-, and synbiotics); physical activity and sedentary behaviour. We used the Medline database and the Cochrane Library to search for relevant publications. Important  gaps were  identified. This position paper provides recommendations on dietary factors, food habits, and life to prevent hood obesity development, based on the available literature and expert opinion.

Verify it DS are different according to MCFS; 4. Identify DS's predictors. Method. Correlational cross-sectional . The participants were 259 dyads (mother-preschool ) residents in Mexico' Northeast. Mothers answered the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Revised, and the Caregiver Feeding Styles Questionnaire. Mann-Whitney U test, Chi-square test, Kruskall-Wallis H, and multiple linear regression analysis were performed. Results. Twelve point eight percent of the mothers (n = 33) had DS, 35.5% (n = 92) authoritarian MCFS. No significant difference was identified between DS and MCFS according to the 's OW-OB or lack thereof (U = 5726.0, p .05 and X-2 = .078, gl = 3, p > .05). A significant positive correlation was found between DS and MCFS demandingness (r(s) = .208, p = .001). The authoritarian MCFS had the highest DS mean (H = 10.70, gl = 3, p < .05). The demandingness predicts the DS (X-2 = 826.445, gl = 1, p = .001). Discussion and conclusion. Authoritarian MCFS predominated, DS were higher in mothers with authoritarian MCFS; demandingness predicts DS. It is recommended to promote authoritarian MCFS which favors the development of healthy eating habits."
Cause of Caregiver Death and Surviving Caregiver Coping Style Predict Thwarted Belongingness in Bereaved Youth,2019,"Both bereavement and thwarted belongingness serve as risk markers for youth suicide-related behaviors. This  examined candidate predictors of thwarted belongingness among bereaved youth, including caregiver cause of death and surviving caregiver coping . A group of 43 caregiver-bereaved families (58  aged 7-13-years-old) participated in a longitudinal  investigating associations between hypothesized bereavement-related contextual factors and youth thwarted belongingness. Cause of caregiver deaths included anticipated deaths preceded by illness (37%; n = 16), sudden natural deaths (25.6%; n = 11), accidental deaths (20.9%; n = 9), death by suicide (9.3%; n = 4), and death from drug overdose (7.0%; n = 3). Children's thwarted belongingness was significantly higher among youth bereaved by suicide compared to youth bereaved by sudden natural death, accident, and anticipated death by illness. Surviving caregivers' use of behavioral disengagement and positive reinterpretation and growth as coping strategies at Time 1 predicted lower thwarted belongingness in  at Time 2. Implications for risk screening and assessment of suicide risk among bereaved youth are discussed."
Fathers' Representation in Observational Studies on Parenting and Childhood Obesity: A Systematic Review and Content Analysis,2016,"Background. The involvement of fathers in caregiving has increased substantially over the past 30 years. Yet in  and adolescent psychopathology, few studies include fathers as  participants and few   for fathers separate from those for mothers. We test for the first time whether a similar pattern exists in  on  and hood obesity. Objectives. To conduct a systematic review and quantitative content analysis of observational studies on  and hood obesity to (1) document the inclusion of fathers, relative to mothers, as  participants and (2) examine characteristics of studies that did and did not include fathers. This  s new data on the number and gender of   participants. Search methods. We searched title, abstract, and Medical Subject Headings term fields in 5  databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Academic Search Premier, PsycINFO, and CINAHL) using terms combining s or  (e.g., mother, father, caregiver,  , food ) and obesity (e.g., obesity, body weight, overweight) or obesity-related life behaviors (e.g., diet, snacking, physical activity, outdoor play, exercise, media use). Selection criteria. We identified and screened studies as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) published between January 2009 and December 2015, examining links between  and hood obesity, including s or caregivers as  participants, and written in English. We excluded interventions, nonhuman studies, dissertations, conference abstracts, and studies on youths with specific medical conditions. Of 5557 unique studies, 667 studies were eligible. Data collection and analysis. For each of the 667 studies, 4 coders were trained to code characteristics of the  (e.g., publication year, geographic region, journal,  focus) and   participants (e.g.,  gender, demographic background, biological relationship with , and residential status). We established intercoder reliability before coding the full sample of studies (mean Krippendorf's alpha = .79; average percentage agreement = 94%). Main . Of the studies, 1% included only fathers. By contrast, 36% included only mothers. Although slightly more than 50% of studies (n = 347) included at least 1 father, only 57 studies reported  for fathers separate from those for mothers. When we combined them with studies including only fathers, 10% of studies overall reported  for fathers. Samples sizes of fathers were small compared with mothers. Of studies with fathers, 59% included 50 or fewer fathers, whereas 22% of studies with mothers included 50 or fewer mothers. The mean sample size for fathers across all eligible studies was 139, compared with 672 for mothers. Overall, fathers reed 17% of  participants across all eligible studies. Conclusions. This  unequivocally demonstrates that fathers are underreed in recent observational  on  and hood obesity. Public health implications. The underreation of fathers in obesity  compromises the development of effective family interventions for hood obesity prevention. Targeted opportunities and incentives are needed to support  with fathers. (The full article is available online.)"
PREDICTORS OF MATERNAL AND PATERNAL PARENTING STRESS IN CENTRAL AMERICAN REFUGEE FAMILIES WITH ADOLESCENT OFFSPRING,2009,"Despite their strong presence in North America, Central American refugees have been identified as the most critically understudied Hispanic group. Relatively little is known about their cultural and familial adaptation (Dona & Berry, 1994; Guarnaccia, 1997; Organista, 2007). The cultural life of Central Americans is centered on the family and community rather than on the rugged individualism of North American society. Family and community relationships tend to have a hierarchical power structure with associated mores for interaction, in contrast to an egalitarian arrangement (Hernandez, 2005; Organista; Sue & Sue, 2008). Transmission of the culture of origin to one's  is a key focus among Central American families (Hernandez; Organista). Refugee s have been found to have a heightened attachment to their heritage culture due to the forced rather than voluntary nature of their resettlement process in the host society (Roizblatt & Pilowsky, 1996). However, intergenerational cultural transmission may be compromised by the pressures that adolescents experience to assimilate with peers in the new socio-cultural environment. s may use youth's behavior and ethnic identity to gauge the effectiveness of their  ability and strategies, with signs of weak ethnic identity or Western cultural influence generating stress in the rearing process (Baptiste, 1993; Hernandez; Sue & Sue). Existing  suggests that Central American mothers and fathers may play different roles in the cultural socialization of  (Harwood, Leyendecker, Carlson, Asencio, & Miller, 2002; Phinney & Vedder, 2006; Sue & Sue), implying a possible variance in indicators of adolescents' cultural stance that may serve as predictors of stress for s of each gender. This chapter describes a   investigating relationships between  stress and adolescent ethnic identity development, adolescents' openness to behavior changes towards Western norms, and adolescents' age of migration among 100 Central American refugee families. Close to one-third of the participating s reported high or clinically significant stress levels. Stepwise Multiple Regression Analysis revealed that in combination, adolescents' age of arrival in Canada and level of openness to behavior changes towards Western norms accounted for 37 percent of the variance in mothers' stress scores. Adolescent ethnic identity development was the only significant predictor of fathers' stress levels, accounting for 12 percent of the variance in fathers' stress scores. Relationships between these variables and maternal and paternal stress are discussed considering each 's role in adolescents' cultural socialization. Recommendations for assisting with the  process across two cultures are  ed."
"PARENTAL LEGITIMACY, PROCEDURAL JUSTICE, AND COMPLIANCE WITH PARENTAL RULES AMONG BRAZILIAN PREADOLESCENTS",2018,"The purpose of this  is to capture a snapshot of the lives of Brazilian preadolescents and gain a deeper understanding of the variables that influence compliance with al rules. This analysis draws from the Sao Paulo Legal Socialization Study, a cohort  (N = 800; age = 11 years) from public and private schools. Descriptive statistics provide a perspective on normative Brazilian  practices and preadolescents' perceptions of al legitimacy across multiple domains. Hierarchical linear modeling revealed that procedural justice, global legitimacy, issue-specific legitimacy, and disciplinary techniques all significantly predicted compliance across issues and between preadolescents. s who used constructive disciplinary practices paired with procedural justice practices were more likely to be perceived as legitimate authorities and to have their preadolescent  comply with their rules. Our findings broaden the literature on constructive  practices in preadolescence, and allow for greater generalizability of current Western  to a diverse metropolitan setting in Brazil."
Prevalence and familial predictors of suicidal behaviour among adolescents in Lithuania: a cross-sectional survey 2014,2016,"Background: In the past decades Lithuania has been experiencing a very high suicide rate among young people and there are scarce data on the role of the family in shaping these people suicidal behaviour. This  investigated the prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts, as well as their association with a range of familial factors in a reative sample of Lithuanian adolescents. Methods: Study subjects (N = 3572) were adolescents aged 13- and 15-years from the schools in Lithuania who were surveyed in Spring 2014 according to the methodology of the cross-national Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC). A standard HBSC international questionnaire was translated into Lithuanian and used anonymously to obtain information about suicidal behaviour (stopped doing activities, considered suicide, planned suicide, and suicide attempts) and family life (family structure, quality of communication in family, al monitoring and bonding,  , family time, etc.). Logistic regression was used to assess association between suicidal behaviours and familial variables. Results: Forty three percents of surveyed adolescents reported presence of emotions that stopped doing activities during the last 12 months, 23.8 % seriously considered attempting suicide, 13.7 % made a suicide plan, 13.2 % attempted suicide, and 4.1 % needed treatment because of suicide attempt in the previous year. Adolescents from non-intact families reported more suicidal ideation (OR ranged from 1.32 to 1.35, P < 0.05) and more suicide attempts (OR = 1.70, 95 % CI 1.38-2.09, P < 0.001). Among adolescents from intact families, some manisfestations of suicidal behaviour were significantly associated with low satisfaction in family relationships, low father's and mother's emotional support, low mother's monitoring, low school-related al support, authoritarian-repressive father's   and permissive-neglectful mother's  , but rare family time together and rare electronic media communication with s were inversely associated with suicidal behaviour. The boys, 15-yearolds and adolescents who indicated often activities together with their families were more likely than their counterparts to report suicide attempts treated by a doctor or nurse. Conclusion: The young people of Lithuania are at particular risk for suicides. A non-intact family structure and weak family functioning are significant predictors of suicidal ideation and attempts among adolescents of Lithuania. It is essential to consider family life practices in planning intervention programs for prevention of suicides among adolescents."
Paternal involvement in feeding and its association with nutritional status of  in an urban slum in a low-resource setting: A cross-sectional study,2020,"Objectives: In India, hood malnutrition continues to be a major public health problem, especially in slums. Research mostly focuses on the role of the mother in  feeding, as she spends significantly more time with . However, the role of fathers, their  skills, and -feeding practices may  affect  development and eating behavior, independent of maternal factors. To our knowledge, there is limited  on the role of the father in  undernutrition, especially in the Indian context. Thus, the aim of this  was to address this knowledge gap and to explore paternal -feeding patterns, their involvement in feeding, and its association with malnutrition in the slums. Methods: This community-based, cross-sectional  was conducted in an urban slum in Bangalore. The  included 210 father- dyads. The Caregiver's Feeding Styles Questionnaire was used to assess paternal involvement in  and feeding. Anthropometry measurements were taken using standardized methods. Nutritional status was classified according to the growth standards of the World Health Organization. Logistic regression was used to test the association between paternal   and malnutrition. Results: We recruited 116 boys and 94 girls and their fathers. The mean age of the  was 15.94 mo (SD 4.85). One-fourth of the fathers were illiterate and most of the families belonged to the middle class. Almost half of the fathers fed their  once a day (57.1%) and engaged them during feeding by telling stories (47.1%). The most common paternal feeding  was uninvolved (36%) followed by authoritative (29.5%). Prevalence of undernutrition, stunting, and wasting was 44.3%, 42.8%, and 9.5%, respectively. Religion, type of family, and per capita income were independently associated with uninvolved feeding . There was no association between paternal -feeding  malnutrition (P > 0.05) Conclusion: The   explored the dimensions of paternal involvement in  feeding in a slum setting and its effect on  nutrition. A good proportion of fathers were actively involved in  feeding and neither involvement nor paternal feeding  were associated with the nutritional status of . (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The Good Enough Parenting early intervention schema therapy based program: Participant experience,2021,"Background and objectives Schema therapy (ST) has become a mainstream therapy for the treatment of psychopathology and has been validated through a series of large scale, international randomized control trials. Among other things, schema therapy emphasizes the meeting of core emotional needs in  by primary caregivers as these unmet needs continue to adversely affect their lives into adulthood. An early intervention  program has been developed to help s meet these core emotional needs in order to prevent the development of psychopathology in the first place. The program, Good Enough , is equally focused on reducing problems and strengthening  practices, regardless of where the  is on the disordered to well-being continuum. This  aims to explore patient experience by users of this program. Best clinical  guidelines advocate that participants should be used as collaborators rather than pure recipients; this process should predate large scale trials. Design An exploratory qualitative  with 55 -participants of Good Enough  was conducted. Methods One-to-one interviews were conducted with participants, using critical incident technique and guided by semi-structured interview schedule, to explore their experiences with the program. Transcripts were then analyzed using thematic analysis. Results Coding showed a high degree of inter-rater reliability (kappa value of 0.78). The themes that emerged were Cultivating Awareness of s' Own Schemas, Cultivating Intentionality, Working through Developmental Issues, Responses to Challenges at Home, Performing Multiple Roles, and the Learning Process. Participants overwhelmingly reported satisfaction within these key themes. Conclusions The  support the development of the program and the choice of participant reported outcome measures for use in subsequent randomized controlled trials."
The making of a narcissist,1999,"In discussing the etiology of Narcissistic Personality Disorder, faulty  or disturbed object relations is a common causal theme in most writings. However, the question remains as to its specificity. In this author's experience, faulty  is ubiquitous in all psychological disturbance. This paper postulates that the specific fault lies in the caretaker's failure to provide optimal frustrating experiences necessary to enable the  to develop a more realistic self-image. Clinical case examples reveal some common personality characteristics in the s and   conducive to the 's development of a narcissistic disorder. A brief, informal comparison is made between these cases and over 100 other cases of poor, welfare  who were seen in psychoanalytic treatment by this author."
The Presence of a Controlling Parent Is Related to an Increase in the Error-Related Negativity in 5-7Year-Old Children,2019,"Anxiety disorders often begin early in life and there is substantial interest in identifying neural markers that characterize developmental trajectories that  in anxiety. The error-related negativity (ERN) is elicited when people make errors on lab-based reaction-time tasks, is increased in anxious , and can predict the onset of anxiety across development. In light of this, there is an increasing interest in identifying environmental factors that may shape the ERN in . Previous work suggests that controlling   may relate to the ERN in offspring. However, no  had yet examined the specific mechanism whereby   may impact the ERN in . We propose that it may be 's repeated exposure to making mistakes in the context of their s' reactions (i.e., verbal or non-verbal reactions, displays of al control, etc.) that may lead to an increased ERN. We test this novel hypothesis by measuring the ERN in 94  between the ages of 5-7years old, while their  observes them and then while an experimenter observes them complete a Go-No/Go task. Results suggest that the presence of s characterized by high control potentiates the ERN in their . Moreover, the relationship between controlling   and  anxiety disorder status was mediated by the  presence potentiation of the ERN. These findings are important and novel insofar as they highlight the impact of an environmental factor (i.e., ) in shaping a neural marker of risk for anxiety in  (i.e., the ERN)."
Physical Activity and Screen-Media-Related Parenting Practices Have Different Associations with Children's Objectively Measured Physical Activity,2013,"Background: Children's physical activity (PA) is inversely associated with 's weight status. s may be an important influence on 's PA by restricting sedentary time or supporting PA. The aim of this  was to investigate the association of PA and screen-media-related [television (TV) and videogame]  practices with 's PA. Methods: Secondary analyses of baseline data were performed from an intervention with 9-to 12-year-olds who received active or inactive videogames (n = 83) to promote PA. Children's PA was assessed with 1 week of accelerometry at baseline. s reported their PA, TV, and videogame  practices and 's bedroom screen-media availability. Associations were investigated using Spearman's partial correlations and linear regressions. Results: Although several TV and videogame  practices were significantly intercorrelated, only a few significant correlations existed between screen-media and PA  practices. In linear regression models, restrictive TV  practices were associated with greater  sedentary time (p = 0.03) and less moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA; p = 0.01). PA logistic support  practices were associated with greater  MVPA (p = 0.03). Increased availability of screen-media equipment in the 's bedroom was associated with more sedentary time (p = 0.02) and less light PA (p = 0.01) and MVPA (p = 0.05) in all three models. Conclusion: In this cross-sectional sample, restrictive screen-media and supportive PA  practices had opposite associations with 's PA. Longitudinal and experimental  PA studies should assess PA and screen-media  separately to understand how s influence their 's PA behaviors and whether the 's baseline PA or screen media behaviors affect the 's use of  practices. Recommendations to remove screens from 's bedrooms may  affect their PA."

Family variables and academic achievement in adolescence,2012,"The  examines the relationships between academic performance in adolescents, the amount of time spent doing homework, and family variables (including demographic variables and al educational ), together with developmental trends and gender differences. The sample consisted of 2400 adolescents aged between 12- and 17-years from 20 different schools in Andalusia. The time spent on homework and s' education level are the variables most strongly related with academic achievement. Dimensions of al  contributed to explain variability in academic performance, as four of them had a significant influence. However, while in two cases, behavioural control and disclosure, this relationship is positive, in psychological control and mood, it is negative. Gender differences were found in the variables studied, i.e., in general, the girls' performance was better. A reduction of academic achievement during the course of adolescence was observed in both sexes, though this was more pronounced among males."
Parenting Behaviors and Childhood Anxiety: A Psychometric Investigation of the EMBU-C,2013," rearing behaviors, including both behavioral modeling and - interactions, are associated with anxiety in . Patterns of overprotection or rejecting behavior from s may lead  to develop behavioral avoidance, lower self-confidence, and higher symptoms of anxiety. Additional  is needed to further elucidate the role that  behavior plays in the development of hood anxiety. Unfortunately, few measures of  behavior exist. The EMBU-C is a 40-item -report measure of these behaviors, but empirical data supporting the psychometric properties of the EMBU-C are limited. The current investigation examined the psychometric properties of the EMBU-C in the context of hood anxiety. Participants were 213  with an anxiety disorder and 150 recruited from the community (all aged 8-13 years). Overall, the EMBU-C demonstrated promising psychometrics. In terms of convergent validity,  rearing behaviors described on the EMBU-C were significantly related to 's anxiety symptoms, anxiety-related disability,  stress, family functioning and 's externalizing behaviors. Further, the overprotection and anxious-rearing subscales discriminated between clinical and community participants. Finally, al overprotection significantly predicted increases in  anxiety and anxiety-related disability 1 year later. Thus, the EMBU-C appears to have value as a clinical tool for assessing al factors that may contribute to anxiety in . Recommendations for further item development and measure improvement are offered."
Personality factors of adolescents in relation to the style of bringing up in a family,1996,"The  refers to the  of the contemporary phase of long-termed  realized by the Department of psychology of the Faculty of Philosophy of the Charles university in Prague. The  concentrates on the formation of personality in the family. The authors developed an analytic-synthetic model of the  of bringing up which includes several levels of analysis and expression: every level is compatible to some model of other authors (al attitudes, two dimensions of basic attitudes, forms of communication,  of bringing up). The authors fuse its advantages and in addition they define the forms of bringing up with the inconsistent control and  with the contradictory negative-positive emotional relation to the . These specific forms of bringing up were found nearly in one third of families. At the same time, these forms of bringing up are frequent in adolescents with problems. In the sample of mole than 1400 adolescents aging from 15 to 17 from different places in Bohemia the statistically significant and quite highly significant relations were found between the  of bringing up in a family - as assessed by the authors' questionnaire and expressed by their analytic-synthetic model - and all personality factors assessed by Cattell's HSPQ. The  of bringing up in the family is - according to the data obtained - connected as well as with the factors included in the character (G, Q3) as with the stability - lability (C, O, Q4), with the temperament (especially D, F), and with further subsystems of personality. Less close, though statistically significant relations were found between the  of bringing up and those personality factors which are strongly determined by heredity (H, I, J). The authors treat the relations found as the manifestation of mutual influence of the bringing up in the family and the personality of the developing .

Does the 's room really belong to me? A discussion about independence of a  in the private space of a 's room.,2014,"A 's independence in the 's room has always been an issue about power and control in upbringing topics between the  and his/her s. Nowadays the consumption of material items and media and the opportunities they offer created conditions for a  to desire independence and individual search for meaning, however s of 9-11 years old  get more involved in the issues about the surrounding aesthetic environment and things, as well as the length and contents of the used media. Things and media and their meaning in various 's rooms are different and they actually depend on the 's experience and upbringing patterns in the family. This report features modern 's rooms, the expressions of a 's independence in a 's room; and these points are analysed and explained by aspects such as individuality, independence, privacy and   in the family. There is a contradiction about the understanding and perception of expressions of independence between the  and his/her s. The socio-material approach is applied in this report. The  examines five case studies, respectively, five interviews with 9-11 years old  who have their own 's room, five interviews with their s and photographs of these 's room that express and outline those meanings that cannot be disclosed by interviews. The case  analysis provides an answer to the following question: whether a 's room really belongs to him/her in case the  cannot choose and independently use the objects in the 's room in accordance with his/her perception, meanings and sense?"
Association between perception of maternal bonding styles and social anxiety disorder among young women,2015,"Objective: To evaluate the association between social anxiety disorder (SAD) and perceived maternal bonding  among young women during pregnancy and 30 months after birth. Methods: A cohort of young women from the city of Pelotas, Brazil was followed up from pregnancy to 30 months postpartum. The Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus was used to assess SAD and the al Bonding Instrument was administered to measure maternal bonding . Poisson regression with robust variance was used for multivariable analysis. Results: After adjusting for potential confounding factors, SAD prevalence was 6.39 times higher among young women who perceived their mothers as neglectful (prevalence ratio [PR] 6.39; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.2-32.0), and 5.57 times higher in women who perceived their mothers as affectionless controlling (PR = 5.57; 95% CI 1.5-19.7) when compared with those who received optimal care. Conclusion: Maternal bonding  may have an influence on the development of SAD. Therefore, support and early prevention strategies should be offered to the family."
Stability and social-behavioral consequences of toddlers' inhibited temperament and parenting behaviors,2002,"A prospective longitudinal design was employed to ascertain whether different types of behavioral inhibition (i.e., traditional, peer-social) were stable from toddler to preschool age, and whether inhibited temperament and/or   would predict 's subsequent social and behavioral problems. At Time 1, 108 toddlers (54 males, 54 females) and their mothers were observed in the Traditional Inhibition Paradigm and in a toddler-peer session; then at age 4 years, 88  were observed with unfamiliar peers, and maternal ratings of psychological functioning were obtained. flow mothers and their toddlers interacted was  observed. Results revealed meaningful connections between toddler inhibition, maternal intrusive control and derision, and nonsocial behaviors at age 4. Both forms of toddler inhibition predicted socially reticent behavior during free play at 4 years. If mothers demonstrated relatively high frequencies of intrusive control and/or derisive comments, then the association between their toddlers' peer inhibition and 4-year social reticence was significant and positive; whereas if mothers were neither intrusive nor derisive, then toddlers' peer inhibition and 4-year reticence were not significantly associated. Thus, maternal behaviors moderated the relation between toddlers' peer inhibition and preschoolers' social reticence."

The   is unique in examining AS and CD in mothers with unipolar depression, bipolar disorder, or chronic physical illness, and in normal controls. The sample consisted of 64 mothers with  ages 8 to 16. Unipolar mothers were more likely to show negative AS than were any other maternal group. There were no group differences for CD. Chronic stress, few positive life events, and single  were associated with AS. CD was associated solely with lower socioeconomic status. Results suggest that dysfunctional interactions are determined not only by maternal psychopathology, but  by an array of contextual factors that are related to the quality of the family environment."
Parenting and hood obesity: Validation of a new questionnaire and evaluation of treatment effects during the preschool years,2021,"Objectives  is an integral component of obesity treatment in early hood. However, the link between specific  practices and treatment effectiveness remains unclear. This paper introduces and validates a new  questionnaire and evaluates mothers' and fathers'  practices in relation to  weight status during a 12-month hood obesity treatment trial. Methods First, a merged school/clinical sample (n = 558, 82% mothers) was used for the factorial and construct validation of the new  questionnaire. Second, changes in  were evaluated using clinical data from the More and Less Study, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 174  (mean age = 5 years, mean Body Mass Index Standard Deviation Score (BMI SDS) = 3.0) comparing a  support program (with and without booster sessions) and standard treatment. Data were collected at four time points over 12 months. We used linear mixed models and mediation models to investigate associations between changes in  practices and treatment effects. Findings The validation of the questionnaire (9 items; responses on a 5-point Likert scale) revealed two dimensions of  (Cronbach's alpha >= 0.7): setting limits to the  and regulating one's own emotions when interacting with the , both of which correlated with feeding practices and al self-efficacy. We administered the questionnaire to the RCT participants. Fathers in standard treatment increased their emotional regulation compared to fathers in the  program (p = 0.03). Mothers increased their limit-setting regardless of treatment allocation (p = 0.01). No treatment effect was found on  weight status through changes in  practices. Conclusion Taken together, the findings demonstrate that the new questionnaire assessing  practices proved valid in a 12-month hood obesity trial. During treatment, paternal and maternal  practices followed different trajectories, though they did not mediate treatment effects on  weight status. Future  should address the pathways whereby maternal and paternal  practices affect treatment outcomes, such as  eating behaviors and weight status."
The Relationship Between Resilience and Posttraumatic Growth Among the Primary Caregivers of Children With Developmental Disabilities: The Mediating Role of Positive Coping Style and Self-Efficacy,2022,"This  was conducted to investigate the relationship between posttraumatic growth (PTG), resilience, positive coping , and self-efficacy among the primary caregivers of  with developmental disorders in Chongqing, China. A total of 198 primary caregivers (s and grands) aged from 22 to 66 years old (M = 35.55, SD = 9.16), including 155 females (78.3%) and 43 males (21.7%), were enrolled. The Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire, and General Self-Efficacy Scale were used for data collection. The  found that PTG could be positively predicted by resilience. Positive coping  and self-efficacy mediated the relationship between resilience and PTG. The different levels of PTG were determined by the resident location, monthly income and education of the primary caregivers.

Affect and maternal parenting as predictors of adaptive and maladaptive behaviors in Chinese ,2006,"Emotional control has traditionally been emphasized in Chinese culture. The primary purpose of the  was to examine the relevance of early affect to social functioning in Chinese . A sample of , initially at two years of age, and their mothers in the People's Republic of China participated in this two-year longitudinal . At Time 1, observational data were collected on 's affect and maternal  in mother- interactions. At Time 2, 's behaviors were assessed in peer interactions. In addition, data on behavioral problems were collected from al reports. It was found that whereas positive affect positively predicted prosocial behavior, negative affect was positively associated with later behavioral problems. Both positive and negative affects were negatively associated with on-task behaviors. Finally,  affect might moderate the relation between maternal  and social behaviors. The  indicate the role of  affect and  in social and behavioral development in Chinese context."
Poor parenting behaviours and dental caries experience in 6-To 7-year-old ,2020,"Objectives The association between poor  and dental caries in  remains unclear. We investigated the association of poor  with dental caries and oral health behaviour among  aged 6-7 years in Japan. Methods Two waves of repeated cross-sectional surveys on  and their caregivers in Adachi City, Tokyo, were analysed. Questionnaires on  behaviour and the 's oral health behaviour were distributed through schools and completed by 8499 caregivers (response rate = 80.8%). The number of decayed or filled primary teeth (dft) at school dental health check-ups was linked to the survey data (N for complete case analysis = 6309). Factor analysis was performed to identify types of poor : poor involvement,  abuse and lack of supervision of a 's health behaviours. The association between factor scores (z-score), the number of dft and oral health behaviour (not brushing teeth twice a day, not controlling snack eating habits and drinking juice every day) was evaluated by Poisson's regressions adjusted for covariates, including caregiver's socioeconomic status. Results Poor involvement and lack of supervision of a 's health behaviours were positively associated with dft (mean ratio, MR [95% confidence interval, CI] =1.05 [1.03, 1.07] and 1.18 [1.16, 1.21], respectively) and unhealthy oral health behaviours. Child abuse was not associated with dft (MR = 0.99 [0.96, 1.01]) but was associated with all three unhealthy oral health behaviours (prevalence ratio, PR [95% CI] were 1.11 [1.06, 1.16], 1.11 [1.06, 1.16] and 1.06 [1.00, 1.11] for not brushing teeth, not controlling snack eating and drinking juice, respectively). Conclusions Poor involvement and lack of supervision of a 's health behaviours were associated with dental caries, and any type of poor  was associated with poor oral health behaviour among ."
"The interplay among socioeconomic status, household chaos, and parenting in the prediction of  conduct problems and callous-unemotional behaviors",2016,"Child conduct problems (CP) reflect a heterogeneous collection of oppositional, aggressive, norm-violating, and sometimes violent behaviors, whereas  callous-unemotional (CU) behaviors reflect interpersonal  of interactions reflecting a lack of guilt and empathy as well as uncaring and shallow emotional responses to others. Taken together, high levels of  CP and CU behaviors are thought to identify a relatively homogenous group of  at elevated risk for persistent and more severe problem behaviors across hood and into adulthood. Although a large body of  has examined the developmental etiology of CP behaviors, only recently has a developmental psychopathology approach been applied to early CU behaviors. The current  examines multiple levels of contextual influences during the first years of life, including family socioeconomic status, household chaos, and  behaviors, on CP and CU behaviors assessed during the first-grade year. Whereas previous studies found associations between  behaviors and  problem behaviors moderated by household chaos, the current  found no evidence of moderation. However, path analyses suggest that the associations between  CP and CU behaviors and the contextual variables of socioeconomic status (family income and al education) and household chaos (disorganization and instability) were mediated by maternal sensitive and harsh-intrusive  behavior. Analyses are ed, interpreted, and discussed with respect to both bioecological and family stress models of development."

Family background in relation to deceptive ability and understanding of the mind,1998,"The purpose of this  was to determine whether social factors might be linked with the development of certain aspects of deception. Fifty-seven  aged between 4 and 5 years were assessed for their ability to be convincing in an act of deception (expressive deception) and  for their understanding that minds are susceptible to deception (theory of mind). The mothers of 34 of the  completed a questionnaire which provided information on socio-economic status,  , al stress and family structure. The  revealed significant associations with family background and deceptive ability. Stepwise multiple regression analyses, controlling for age, identified socio-economic status as a predictor of understanding that the mind is susceptible to deception (theory of mind). In contrast, single  stress emerged as the major predictor of variance in expressive deception. Deceptive socialisation practices specific to single s were considered Implications for the dissimilar developmental pathways of theory of mind and expressive performance in deception are discussed."
AFRI_Starting Early Program Impacts on Feeding at Infant 10 Months Age: A Randomized Controlled Trial,2020,"Background: Disparities in obesity-promoting feeding patterns begin in pregnancy and infancy, underscoring the need for early primary prevention in high-risk groups. We sought to determine the impact of a primary care-based  obesity prevention intervention beginning during pregnancy on maternal infant feeding practices, knowledge, and  at 10 months in low-income Hispanic families. Methods: The Starting Early Program (StEP) randomized controlled trial enrolled pregnant women at a third trimester visit. Women (n = 533) were randomized to standard care or an intervention with prenatal/postpartum individual nutrition counseling and nutrition and  support groups coordinated with pediatric visits. Feeding practices (breastfeeding, family meals, juice, and cereal in the bottle) were assessed using questions from the Infant Feeding Practices Study II. Feeding  were assessed using the Infant Feeding Style Questionnaire. We analyzed impacts on feeding practices, knowledge, and  using regression analyses adjusting for covariates. Results: Four hundred twelve mothers completed 10-month assessments. Intervention mothers were more likely to give breast milk as the only milk source [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-2.58] and have daily family meals (AOR 1.91, 95% CI 1.19-3.05), and less likely to give juice (AOR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39-0.92) or cereal in the bottle (AOR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30-0.97) compared to controls. Intervention mothers were more likely to exhibit lower pressuring, indulgent and laissez-faire feeding , and to have higher knowledge. Attending a greater number of group sessions increased intervention impacts. Conclusions: StEP led to reduced obesity-promoting feeding practices and , and increased knowledge and provides great potential for population-scalability."
Domain-specific antecedents of parental psychological control and monitoring: The role of parenting beliefs and practices,2002,"This  examined the effects of domain-differentiated beliefs about legitimate al authority and ratings of restrictive al control on adolescent- and mother-reported psychological and behavioral control. The influence of  beliefs and practices regarding socially regulated (moral and conventional) and ambiguously personal (multifaceted and personal) issues was examined in 93 middle-class African American early adolescents (M = 13.11 years, SD = 1.29) and their mothers, who were followed longitudinally for 2 years. Domain-specific  beliefs and ratings predicted adolescent-reported maternal psychological control and al monitoring, but the nature and direction of the relations differed. Adolescents who rated s as more restrictive in their control of personal issues and who believed that s should have less legitimate authority over these issues rated their mothers as higher in psychological control. In contrast, more adolescent-reported al monitoring was associated with gender (being female) and adolescents' beliefs that s have more legitimate authority to regulate personal issues. As expected, adolescent age and gender influenced mother-reported monitoring and psychological control; in addition, the effects of mothers' ratings of restrictive control on both psychological control and monitoring were moderated by gender. The  indicate that psychological control and monitoring can be understood in terms of the particular behaviors that are controlled, as well as the  in which control is exercised."
The relationship of parenting stress and  temperament to language development among economically disadvantaged preschoolers,2008,"Oral language skills in the preschool years are predictive of 's later reading success and literacy acquisition, and among these language skills, vocabulary and narrative ability play important roles. Children from low socioeconomic families face risks to their language development and because of threats to these skills it is important to identify factors that promote their development among high-risk groups. This preliminary  explored two potential factors that may be related to language skills in 56 low SES mother- dyads ( aged 2;8-4;10), namely  temperament and  stress. Results showed that  temperament and  stress were related to 's oral language skills. Child temperament characteristics that would likely aid social interaction were related to narrative ability and  rated high on emotionality had poorer receptive vocabulary skills.  stress was related to 's receptive and expressive vocabulary skills. Results are interpreted in terms of the possible mediating role of - interactions in 's oral language skill development, and future directions for family intervention are discussed."
Does daily distress make parents prone to using psychologically controlling parenting?,2017,"The aim of the   was to investigate whether al daily distress in terms of negative emotions is associated with the daily variation in al use of psychological control with their . Whether al positive emotions play a role in the use of psychological control was  investigated. The participants were 149 Finnish families with a  between the ages of 6 and 7 years. s' negative and positive emotions, 's misconduct, and al use of psychological control when interacting with their  were measured daily using diary questionnaires filled in by the mothers and fathers over 7 successive days in the fall term of the 's first grade and, for replication purposes, again in the spring term. The  of multilevel modelling showed that, after controlling for the level of 's misconduct on a particular day, mothers' and fathers' negative daily emotions were related to a high level of psychological control in . This relation was evident particularly when combined with al perception of a high level of  misconduct. Positive emotions, in turn, were not found to be related to the daily variation in the use of psychological control. The  showed further that, at the level of individuals, mothers' and fathers' high overall level of negative emotions across the week was related to a high overall level of psychologically controlling ."
A longitudinal investigation of the role of parental responses in predicting 's post-traumatic distress,2018,"Background: While al post-trauma support is considered theoretically important for  adjustment, empirical evidence concerning the specific aspects of al responding that influence  post-traumatic distress, or the processes via which any such impacts occur, is extremely limited. We conducted a longitudinal examination of whether al post-trauma appraisals, trauma-specific support  and general   predicted  post-traumatic stress symptom severity (PTSS) following trauma; and whether such influences operated via the 's own appraisals and coping . Method: We recruited 132 - pairs following 's experience of acute trauma. We examined whether al responses assessed at 1-month post-trauma, predicted  PTSS at 6-month follow-up. al trauma-specific appraisals and responses, and general  , were assessed via both self-report and direct observations. Child-report questionnaires were used to assess PTSS and potential mediators. Results: Initial  negative appraisals and encouragement of avoidant coping were associated with higher -reported PTSS at 6-month follow-up. Predictive effects were maintained even when controlling for initial  symptom levels. Observational assessments broadly supported conclusions from self-report. There was evidence that al influences may operate, in part, by influencing the 's own appraisals and coping responses. In contrast, there was no evidence for an influence of more adaptive support or general   on  PTSS. Conclusions: Findings provide important insight into how elements of social support may influence  post-trauma outcomes."
Attributions and behaviours of parents abused as : a mediational analysis of the intergenerational continuity of  maltreatment (Part II),2005,"Background: This  extends previous  (Dixon, Browne, & Hamilton-Giachritsis, 2004) by exploring the mediational properties of   and their relation to risk factors in the inter-generational cycle of  maltreatment. Families with newborns where at least one of the s was physically and/or sexually abused as a  (AP families) were compared, in terms of s' attributions and behaviour, to families where the s had no hood history of victimisation (NAP families). Methods: Information was collected from 4351 families (135 AP families) by community nurses as part of the 'health visiting' service. The same health visitor visited each family twice at home when the  was 4 to 6 weeks and 3 to 5 months of age, to assess behavioural indicators of positive . Results: Within 13 months after birth, 9 (6.7%) AP families were referred for maltreating their own  in comparison to 18 (.4%) NAP families. Assessments found a significantly higher number of risk factors and measures indicating poor  for AP families. Mediational analysis found that intergenerational continuity of  maltreatment was explained to a larger extent (62% of the total effect) by the presence of poor   together with the three significant risk factors ( under 21 years, history of mental illness or depression, residing with a violent adult). The three risk factors alone were less explanatory (53% of the total effect). Conclusion: This  provides an explanation for why a minority of s abused in hood go on to maltreat their own infant, evidencing poor   and mediating risk factors. Hence, prevention may be enhanced in AP families by the promotion of 'positive ' in addition to providing additional support to young s, tackling mental illness/ depression and domestic violence problems."
Parents' and students' reports of parenting: Which are more reliably associated with college student drinking?,2013,"Recent efforts to reduce college student heavy episodic drinking have examined al influences, with the goal of continually refining -based interventions (PBIs). This  has primarily relied on student-reported data, which is often cited as a methodological limitation although the degree to which - and student-reported data on  behaviors correspond is unknown. The goals of the   were to assess the level of consistency between - and student-reported data for commonly examined  constructs and compare their associations with college student drinking. Data were collected from a sample of 145 -student dyads using a longitudinal design. At baseline, s and students reported on al monitoring, approval of light and moderate/heavy drinking, and permissiveness. At a 10-month follow up, students reported on their typical weekly drinking and consequences. s' and students' reports of  behavior at baseline were compared and their associations with student drinking and consequences at follow up were assessed. Agreement between s' and students' reports of  was fair to moderate, with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from .34 to .61. Student-reported data were more reliably associated with student drinking at follow up. Studies examining  influences on college student drinking, including  on PBIs, do not appear to be limited by using student-reported data. Implications for future  are discussed.

Late adolescents' perceptions of their caregiver's feeding styles and practices and those they will use with their own ,1997,"The purpose of this  was to examine the perceptions of late adolescents regarding their caregivers' feeding  and practices and their perceptions of those they plan to use with their . The 546 subjects were ii om a randomly selected sample of 1,000, non, 18 to 23-year old college students who responded to a questionnaire. Two distinct feeding  emerged: adult-controlled and cooperative. The adult-controlled  reflects a perception of control in which the adult decides what and how much a  will eat. The cooperative  reflects shared control where the adult decides what food will be ed and the  decides how much and whether to eat. Chi-square analysis of the relationship between subjects' perceptions of their caregivers' feeding  and their perceptions of the  they believe they will use with their , ed in a positive association. To examine perceived past and future feeding practices, a Pearson's r was computed on subscales from a factor analysis. Results indicated positive correlations between subjects' perceived past and future feeding practices. These  suggest generational transmission of feeding  and practices. A recommendation is made for  and nutrition educators to focus on both   and feeding practices."
Parental implications in criminal behavior of teenagers: trends and narratives,2015,"Criminal behavior is a matter of concern to different stakeholders. The need to respond appropriately to their attention has led to the development of different variables involved in the phenomenon from different perspectives. The aim of this paper is to  two methodologies that are complementary rather than opposed to understanding one of the most mentioned variables in these studies, which is the al relationships of a group of 133 inmates in the prison system of Jalisco. First quantitative test is performed through survival analysis of age of onset in criminal and who has brought the members of the sample behavior. The  show that respondents who were not raised by both s, have a foray into criminal behavior at an earlier age. Subsequently there has been an analysis of life stories, where the ing categories that refer to  by one  figure are obtained through a crosstab for your understanding."
Recognition of facial emotion and perceived parental bonding styles in healthy volunteers and personality disorder patients,2011,"Aims: Early al bonding experiences play a role in emotion recognition and expression in later adulthood, and patients with personality disorder frequently experience inappropriate al bonding , therefore the aim of the   was to explore whether al bonding  is correlated with recognition of facial emotion in personality disorder patients. Methods: The al Bonding Instrument (PBI) and the Matsumoto and Ekman Japanese and Caucasian Facial Expressions of Emotion (JACFEE) photo set tests were carried out in 289 participants. Results: Patients scored lower on al Care but higher on al Freedom Control and Autonomy Denial subscales, and they displayed less accuracy when recognizing contempt, disgust and happiness than the healthy volunteers. In healthy volunteers, maternal Autonomy Denial significantly predicted accuracy when recognizing fear, and maternal Care predicted the accuracy of recognizing sadness. In patients, paternal Care negatively predicted the accuracy of recognizing anger, paternal Freedom Control predicted the perceived intensity of contempt, maternal Care predicted the accuracy of recognizing sadness, and the intensity of disgust. Conclusions:  bonding  have an impact on the decoding process and sensitivity when recognizing facial emotions, especially in personality disorder patients."
Can Parenting Practices Moderate the Relationship between Reward Sensitivity and Adolescents' Consumption of Snacks and Sugar-Sweetened Beverages?,2020,"Background: Reward sensitivity has been associated with adolescents' intake of unhealthy snacks and sugar-sweetened beverages. However, so far, there are no studies published describing the impact of  practices on this relationship. The   will, therefore, investigate whether food  practices can moderate the association between reward sensitivity and diet intakes. Method: A cross-sectional   was conducted among 14- to 16-year old Flemish adolescents (n = 867, age 14.7 +/- 0.8 y, 48.1% boys) and a subset of their s (n = 131), collecting data on daily intakes, reward sensitivity, and food  practices. Linear regression was used to assess the moderation effect of  practices (both adolescent- and -reported) on the relationship between reward sensitivity, and diet using SPSS 25.0. Results: In the main analysis (adolescent-reported), no significant moderation effects were found for  practices on the relationship between reward sensitivity and diet. However, the sensitivity analysis (-reported) showed a moderation effect for health-reducing  practices on the association between reward sensitivity and unhealthy snack intake (beta = 0.297, 95% CI = 0.062, 0.531, p = 0.01). Conclusion: Given the difference in the effect of  practices between the adolescent- and -reported data, our inconclusive findings warrant more  in larger adolescent- dyad samples."
"Recalled parental bonding, adult attachment style, and personality disorders in  molesters: A comparative study",2005,"This article studies recalled al bonding, adult attachment , and personality disorders in  molesters and reports on the findings of two separate studies. The first  examines differences between a group of 84  molesters and 80 matched normal control subjects. This  found that the antisocial and the schizoid personality disorders are typical for the molester group, and that at an interpersonal level this group can be typified by recollections of an uncaring father and mother, recollections of an elevated level of autonomy emanating from the father, and insecure current attachment patterns. The second  compares a subgroup of personality-disordered  molesters to a subgroup without personality disorders. This  revealed that recollections of the role of the father in  are decisive. The personality-disordered group reports that the father was both more uncaring and granted more autonomy. Regarding current adult attachment , an avoidant and anxious-ambivalent attachment  characterised the disordered subgroup. We argue that the  can be useful for treatment. Since recalled al experiences play a role in the development of personality disorders and  molestation, psychotherapists should integrate interpersonal tools into treatment, especially in therapeutic work with  molesters who received less al sensitivity and suffer from personality disorders."
Importance of fathers' parenting to African-American toddler's social and cognitive development,1998,"The   examined the degree to which  attitudes and behavior (i.e., self-reported warmth, restrictiveness, and behavioral sensitivity as assessed during a freeplay session) were related to toddlers' development. Results showed a restrictive attitude was negatively related to social and cognitive development, whereas paternal sensitivity was positively related to aspects of social development that are less dependent on language skills (e.g., motor and daily living skills). Fathers of girls exhibited greater sensitivity in their freeplay interactions than fathers of boys. More globally, the   demonstrates important relations between the  attitudes and behavior of low- to working-income African-American fathers and young 's development, and similarities to White, middle-income fathers."
POSTPARTUM BONDING DIFFICULTIES AND ADULT ATTACHMENT STYLES: THE MEDIATING ROLE OF POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION AND CHILDBIRTH-RELATED PTSD,2018,"Despite decades of  demonstrating the role of adult attachment  and early mother-infant bonding in  behaviors and maternal mental health, these constructs have seldom been studied together. The   aimed to investigate the relationship between attachment  and specific bonding difficulties of mothers. In addition, as postpartum depression and birth-related posttraumatic stress symptoms have been associated with both constructs, we explored their possible mediation effect. One hundred fourteen mothers, 4 to 12 weeks' postpartum, completed a demographic questionnaire, the Adult Attachment Style Questionnaire (M. Mikulincer, V. Florian, & A. Tolmacz, 1990), the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire (L.F. Brockington, C. Fraser, & D. Wilson, 2006), the Modified Perinatal Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Questionnaire (J.L. Callahan, S.E. Borja, & M.T. Hynan, 2006), and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (J.L. Cox, G. Chapman, D. Murray, & P. Jones, 1996), using an online survey system. As predicted, insecure attachment  were associated with bonding difficulties wherein anxious/ambivalent attachment was associated with greater infant-focused anxiety, mediated by postpartum depression but not birth-related PTSD symptoms. In contrast, greater avoidant attachment  was associated with greater rejection and anger, mediated by birth-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but not depression symptoms. The current  confirmed the association of different attachment  with bonding as well as the mediating roles of birth-related PTSD and postpartum depression symptoms. Future psychological interventions may utilize such evidence to target interventions for bonding disorders in accordance with individual differences."
"Childhood circumstances, psychosocial factors and the social impact of adult oral health",2005,"Objectives: The aim of this  was to determine whether hood familial conditions are associated with the social impact of adult oral health and to investigate the role of psychosocial attributes as potential mechanisms by which risk might be conveyed from hood to adulthood. Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, self-report data were obtained from a reative sample of adults in Australia with a telephonic interview and a self-completed questionnaire. The dependent variable was the sum of impacts on the short-form Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14). Childhood familial conditions included socioeconomic position assessed by paternal occupation group, family structure and quality of rearing. Current adult sense of control, perceived stress and satisfaction with life were assessed with standard scales and social support was evaluated with four items. Results: Data were obtained for 3678 dentate adults aged 18-91 years. In bivariate analysis controlling for sex, age and household income in adulthood,   was significantly associated with OHIP-14 scores (ANOVA, P<0.001). Adults who were reared supportively had more favourable scores on all four current psychosocial attributes (ANOVA, P<0.001). All four psychosocial attributes were associated with summed OHIP scores in the expected directions (ANOVA, P<0.001). In the multiple regression, al rearing  was significantly associated with social impact after adjusting for sex, age and household income in adulthood, but was no longer significant in the presence of the psychosocial factors. Conclusion: The importance of al rearing to adult oral health may be mediated through the quality and nature of psychosocial attributes."
Prevention of behavior problems in a selected population: Stepping Stones Triple P for parents of young  with disabilities,2014,"Because young  with disabilities are at elevated risk for development of challenging behaviors, and caregivers of these  typically lack access to evidence-based  interventions, two randomized trials were conducted to examine the impact of an evidence-based  intervention, Stepping Stones Triple P (SSTP), as a selective preventive intervention. Both studies targeted s of  under two with a variety of disabilities who were enrolled in the IDEA Part C Early Intervention (El) system in one state. SSTP was delivered in family homes. In Study One, 49 families were randomly assigned to El services as usual, with or without SSTP; a 52% attrition rate from treatment was seen. No significant between-group differences were seen aside from a trend toward reduced symptoms of al depression at follow-up. Intervention group  demonstrated significant decline in behavior problems from post treatment to follow-up, and there was a trend toward improved   in the intervention group during this same time frame. Study Two incorporated a separate workforce intervention for El service coordinators; 40 families on their caseloads were then randomly assigned to receive El services as usual with or without SSTP. Attrition from treatment was limited to 20%. No differential impact was seen on  behavior; a trend was noted post-treatment on  symptoms of depression and on the observed - relationship. At 12-month follow-up, there was a trend favoring improvement in the intervention group in  ; statistically significant impact was  seen on the observed quality of the - relationship. SSTP shows promise as a selective preventive intervention for an early intervention population. Reasons for the differential findings between the two studies are explored and suggestions for future  are provided. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Ethnic variances in socializing young 's mastery motivation among White, African American, and Hispanic low-income families",2020,"Mastery motivation is an individual's drive to master and influence the environment and overcome challenges. Family plays the most important role in fostering 's mastery motivation development, starting from a young age. However, there is no unique way of socializing 's mastery motivation. The current  focused on ethnic variations in the patterns of s' behaviors (autonomy supportiveness, cognitive stimulation, and intrusiveness) when  encounter challenges, among White, African American, and Hispanic low-income families. Using Latent profile analysis (LPA), the  indicated unique   in each ethnic groups. Especially, majority of African American and Hispanic s' response  cannot be captured by Self-Determination Theory and empirical studies which based on white sample. Through comparing 's persistence and frustration across groups within each ethnic group, African American and Hispanic groups have more than one effective   in supporting 's mastery motivation. This  indicated the diversity in socializing young 's mastery motivation, and informed future ethnic adaptive practices in supporting young 's mastery motivation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Working with fathers of at-risk : Insights from a qualitative process evaluation of an intensive group-based intervention,2016,"This article is based on qualitative  with fathers who attended Mellow Dads, an intensive 'dads only' group-based intervention underpinned by attachment theory for fathers of at-risk . Specifically the article draws on data from a process evaluation of the programme in order to explore the challenges of engaging men in effective family work The methods used to undertake the process evaluation included participant observation of one complete Mellow Dads course, interviews with fathers and facilitators, interviews with the intervention author and a  of programme documentation. The article focuses on the theoretical underpinning of the programme, its acceptability to the fathers and the challenges faced by facilitators in delivering the programme as intended. The fathers appreciated the efforts of facilitators to make the group work, valued the advice on play and   as well as the opportunity to meet other fathers in similar circumstances. However, there were obstacles that impacted on the effectiveness of the programme. These included the considerable time required to get the men to attend in the first place and then to keep them coming, the lack of practice of  skills when fathers were not living with their , and the difficulties of sharing personal information. The challenges identified raise questions about how much change can be expected from vulnerable fathers and whether programmes designed for mothers can be applied to fathers with little adaptation. The article aims to contribute to ongoing dialogue about the best way to successfully engage fathers in 's well-being, and raises the question as to whether working with fathers requires different skill-sets and approaches from the more familiar social work territory of working with mothers.

Tiger Mother: Popular and Psychological Scientific Perspectives on Asian Culture and Parenting,2013,
Perceived Parenting Mediates Serotonin Transporter Gene (5-HTTLPR) and Neural System Function during Facial Recognition: A Pilot Study,2015,"This  examined changes in prefrontal oxy-Hb levels measured by NIRS (Near-Infrared Spectroscopy) during a facial-emotion recognition task in healthy adults, testing a mediational/moderational model of these variables. Fifty-three healthy adults (male = 35, female = 18) aged between 22 to 37 years old (mean age = 24.05 years old) provided saliva samples, completed a EMBU questionnaire (Swedish acronym for Egna Minnen Betraffande Uppfostran [ My memories of upbringing]), and participated in a facial-emotion recognition task during NIRS recording. There was a main effect of maternal rejection on RoxH (right frontal activation during an ambiguous task), and a gene x environment (GxE) interaction on RoxH, suggesting that individuals who carry the SL or LL genotype and who endorse greater perceived maternal rejection show less right frontal activation than SL/LL carriers with lower perceived maternal rejection. Finally, perceived   played a mediating role in right frontal activation via the 5-HTTLPR genotype. Early-perceived  might influence neural activity in an uncertain situation i.e. rating ambiguous faces among individuals with certain genotypes. This preliminary  makes a small contribution to the mapping of an influence of gene and behaviour on the neural system. More such attempts should be made in order to clarify the links."
"Perceived Parenting and Adolescent Cyber-Bullying: Examining the Intervening Role of Autonomy and Relatedness Need Satisfaction, Empathic Concern and Recognition of Humanness",2016,"Due to the progress in information technology, cyber-bullying is becoming one of the most common forms of interpersonal harm, especially among teenagers. The   (N = 548) aimed to investigate the relation between perceived   (in terms of autonomy support and psychological control) and cyber-bullying in adolescence. Thereby, the  tested for the intervening role of adolescent need satisfaction (i.e., autonomy and relatedness), empathic concern towards others, and adolescents' recognition of full humanness to cyber-bullying offenders and victims. Findings revealed both a direct and an indirect relation between  and cyber-bullying. More specifically, al psychological control directly predicted cyber-bullying, whereas al autonomy support related to less cyber-bullying indirectly, as it was associated with the satisfaction of adolescents' need for autonomy, which predicted more empathic concern towards others, which in turn differentially related to recognition of humanness to victims and bullies. The discussion focuses on the implications of the current findings."
"Relationships Between Home-Related Factors and Bilingual Abilities: A Study of Chinese-English Dual Language Learners from Immigrant, Low-Income Backgrounds",2019,"Focusing on 84 Chinese-English dual language learners (DLLs) in U.S. preschool programs serving  from low-income backgrounds, this  investigated which aspects of the home language and literacy environment and which   may be related to these DLLs' oral receptive and expressive language abilities in Chinese and English. Key findings were: (1) the frequency of al book reading was associated with better expressive English in DLLs; (2) al book reading (whether in English or in a combination of English and Chinese) was linked to better expressive English in DLLs; (3) DLLs whose s read to them in Chinese (Chinese-dominant) and those whose s read to them in both Chinese and English (bilingual language-dominant) achieved better receptive Chinese than those whose s did not read to them at all; (4) DLLs whose s used both English and Chinese (bilingual language-dominant) when conversing with them achieved better expressive English than those whose s used exclusively Chinese (Chinese-dominant); and (5) authoritative  was associated with better receptive Chinese in DLLs. Interpretations of the findings were discussed in the context of bilingualism."
The Family Socialization Interview-Revised (FSI-R): a Comprehensive Assessment of Parental Disciplinary Behaviors,2017,"Elucidating the complex mechanisms by which harsh  increases risk of  psychopathology is key to targeted prevention. This requires nuanced methods that capture the varied perceptions and experiences of diverse families. The Family Socialization Interview-Revised (FSI-R), adapted from an interview developed by Dodge et al. (Child Development, 65, 649-665, 1994), is a comprehensive, semi-structured interview for characterizing methods of al discipline used with young . The FSI-R coding system systematically rates  , usual discipline techniques, and most intense physical and psychological discipline based on rater judgment across two eras: (1) birth to the previous year, and (2) the previous year to . The current  examined the psychometric properties of the FSI-R in a diverse, high-risk community sample of 386 mothers and their , ages 3 to 6 years. Interrater reliability was good to excellent for codes capturing physically and psychologically harsh , and restrictive/punitive  . Findings supported the FSI-R's convergent and incremental validity. Importantly, the FSI-R demonstrated incremental utility, explaining unique variance in 's externalizing and internalizing symptoms beyond that explained by traditional surveys and observed . The FSI-R appeared particularly promising for capturing risk associated with young 's depressive symptoms, as these were generally not significantly associated with other measures of harsh . Overall, findings support the added value of the FSI-R within a multi-method assessment of disciplinary practices across early  development. Future implications for prevention are discussed."
On some models of altruistic behavior,2021,"The paper surveys several recent approaches to ing, modeling, and interpreting altruistic behavior. In the first section we describe a modification of the system of axioms of classical rational choice theory taking into consideration moral reference points. We  the moral monotonicity axiom, compare the predictions of the standard and the modified system of axioms, and describe series of experiments contradicting the standard system, but agreeing with the modified one. In the second section we discuss the approach of J. Roemer who suggested to consider Kantian optimization in place of the standard Nash one. It is well known that Nash equilibria are not necessarily optimal. It happens, as, for example, in the tragedy of the commons, that all the participants would benefit from choosing a different, non-Nash equilibrium, and in this section we consider mechanisms allowing to realize an optimal choice. In the third section we consider a model in which different   (based on altruism and paternalism) emerge as equilibrium outcomes and are affected by both al preferences and the socioeconomic environment. We discuss statistical and experimental data showing historical development of al  and allowing to check various predictions of the model."
PATRIARCHAL UPBRINGING IN THE 21ST CENTURY: THE IMPACT EMOTIONAL ABUSE RELATED TO PARENTAL STYLES HAS ON THE GENESIS OF GENDER INEQUALITY AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF UNRESOLVED TRAUMA IN CHILDREN,2021,"Background: Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG) (physical, sexual, and psychological/emotional) is a type of structural discrimination that violates the basic human rights of females on a global scale. Cultural norms that glorify male dominance, power imbalances, and abuse of authority are the most encountered reasons for VAWG. Emotional abuse, which can start in hood, is widely recognised as the most prevalent form of VAWG. However, although victims of emotional abuse usually suffer terribly, perpetrators often evade accountability. Emotional abuse is underestimated in part because it is normalized by victims who are mostly women and girls. The normalization of VAWG is contributing to the propagation and perpetuation of biased perceptions of sexism. The intergenerational transmission of   - which is an important contributory factor for  development often includes gender-stereotyping norms, or patriarchy. Hitherto, limited focus has been directed towards the consequences that emotional abuse related to patriarchal upbringing has on . Aim - to investigate if emotional abuse related to patriarchal upbringing influences the perception of sexism and gender stereotyping across genders, and the development of unresolved trauma in . Methods: Participants were recruited via social media platforms to complete online questionnaires assessing al emotional abuse, control, trauma, misogyny, and perceptions of sexism. Parametric analyses were conducted on the 188 participants (158 women and 30 men) recruited. Trauma and perceptions of sexism were statistically analysed using correlation and multiple linear regression. Results: Our findings show that al emotional abuse and control in females predicted for unresolved traumatic experiences (16.6%). Misogynistic culture and male gender predicted for hostile sexism (9.9%), whereas emotional abuse predicted for benevolent sexism (40%). Conclusion: Emotional abuse related to patriarchal upbringing contributes to the genesis of gender inequality and unresolved trauma in . Given that al  are transmitted from one generation to the next, to reduce sexism and improve mental health outcomes, the patriarchal al cycle must be broken."
"Associations between parenting and substance use, meal pattern and food choices: A cross-sectional survey of 13,269 Norwegian adolescents",2019,"Identifying factors that affect adolescent life behaviors is essential in order to develop effective generic prevention approaches. This  aimed to investigate the association between al monitoring, al emotional support, al-adolescent conflict and adolescent substance use, meal pattern and food choices. The  included data from 13,269 Norwegian adolescents aged 13-16 years collected in 2016. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for gender, age and al education were applied. Results show that low al monitoring was associated with increased substance use (Odds ratios (OR) ranging from 2.8; 95% Confidence intervals (CI) 2.1-3.6 to OR 3.8; 95% CI, 2.7-5.3) and irregular meal patterns (1.7; 1.3-2.1 to 2.6; 2.1-3.3), low fish intake (1.3;1.0-1.7), and high intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, diet beverages and energy drinks (1.4;1.1-1.7 to 2.1;1.6-2.8). Low al emotional support was associated with increased substance use (1.8;1.5-2.1 to 2.5;1.9-3.2), irregular meal patterns (2.0; 1.8-2.3 to 2.1;1.9-2.3), low intake of vegetables, fruits and fish (1.3; 1.1-1.5 to 1.5; 1.3-1.7) and high intake of salty snacks, candy, cakes, sugar-sweetened beverages, diet beverages and energy drinks (1.4; 1.2-1.6 to 2.1;1.7-2.5). Finally, high -adolescent conflict was associated with increased substance use (2.3; 2.0- 2.7 to 2.7; 2.3-3.1), irregular meal patterns (1.6;1.5-1.8 to 1.9;1.7-2.1), low intake of fruits and fish (1.3; 1.1-1.5 to 1.5; 1.3-1.7) and high intake of salty snacks, candy, cakes, sugar-sweetened beverages, diet beverages and energy drinks (1.5; 1.3-1.7 to 2.1; 1.8-2.5).

Specific Learning Disorders: A Look Inside Children's and Parents' Psychological Well-Being and Relationships,2016,"Despite their ascertained neurobiological origin, specific learning disorders (SLD) often have been found to be associated with some emotional disturbances in , and there is growing interest in the environmental and contextual variables that may modulate 's developmental trajectories. The   was aimed at evaluating the psychological profile of s and  and the relationships between their measures. s of  with SLD (17 couples, 34 participants) and s of  with typical development (17 couples, 34 participants) were administered questionnaires assessing  , reading history,  stress, psychopathological indexes, and evaluations of 's anxiety and depression. Children (N = 34, 10.7 +/- 1.2 years) were assessed with self-evaluation questionnaires on anxiety, depression, and self-esteem and with a scale assessing their perception of s' qualities. Results showed that s of  with SLD have higher al distress, poorer reading history, and different   compared to s of  with TD; there were no differences in psychopathological indexes. The SLD group  rated their  as more anxious and depressed. Children with SLD had lower scholastic and interpersonal self-esteem, but they report ratings of s' qualities similar to those of TD . Relationships between s' and 's measures were further explored. Implications for  and practice are discussed."
The Impact of Parenting Strategies on Child Smoking Behavior: The Role of Child Self-Esteem Trajectory,2010,"Multidisciplinary  has documented that  strategies influence 's cigarette use. Extending the extant literature, this article develops an integrative model that examines the effect of  strategies on 's smoking progression, in which 's self-esteem plays the role of mediator. The authors validate this model using longitudinal panel data from s and  ages 10-17. The primary findings are that  strategies influence 's smoking development and that the impact of these strategies is mediated by the 's self-esteem trajectory, particularly for the rate of increase in smoking. al responsiveness decreases 's smoking development by enhancing the 's initial self-esteem and reducing the natural rate of deterioration in self-esteem, while psychological control increases smoking development both directly and indirectly by reducing initial self-esteem. Targeting s through multimedia ad campaigns to bring about changes in  strategies to reduce or avoid teen smoking offers a fruitful complementary tool to targeting teens themselves. Such campaigns should  emphasize avoiding al psychological control as a strategy and begin reaching s well before their  approach late grade school."
Exposure to dysfunctional parenting and trauma events and posttraumatic stress profiles among a treatment sample with coexisting depression and alcohol use problems,2012,"Introduction and Aims. Trauma exposure (including experiencing dysfunctional  when a ) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently coexist with major depressive disorder (MDD) and alcohol use disorders (AUD), with the impact of this comorbidity usually studied as a dual disorder (i.e. PTSD-MDD or PTSD-AUD). This  explores trauma exposure (including to dysfunctional ), PTSD symptom severity and PTSD in people seeking treatment for coexisting depressive symptoms and alcohol use problems. Design and Methods. Participants (n = 221) with current depression and alcohol use problems were recruited. Trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms and PTSD were assessed using the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale. The Measure of  Style assessed dysfunctional  (neglect/over-control/abuse) experienced as a . Results. Most participants experienced trauma (71.6%, n = 159), with more than one-third reaching DSM-IV criteria for current PTSD (38.0%, n = 84). Unique to this  was that there were no gender differences in rates of trauma exposure, number of traumatic events and PTSD. More severe PTSD symptoms and PTSD were associated with: hood neglect; earlier depression onset; more severe depression and alcohol problems; and lower general functioning. More severe problems with alcohol were related to Intrusion and Avoidance symptoms, while severe alcohol dependence symptoms were related to hyperarousal. Discussion and Conclusions. PTSD symptoms and PTSD are highly prevalent in those with coexisting depression and alcohol use problems and are associated with a history of hood neglect and higher levels of comorbidity. Trauma, PTSD symptoms and PTSD should be assessed and addressed among people seeking treatment for coexisting depression and alcohol problems.[Bailey K, Webster R, Baker AL, Kavanagh DJ.

The  was carried out on a reative sample of 2 823 Croatian high school students. The participants completed scales that measured al support, monitoring and joint decision-making. Adolescent's school achievement, leisure-time activities and self-reported and drug use were  measured. Multiple regression analyses were conducted with school achievement, alcohol and drug use as criterion variables and sociodemographic variables as covariates followed by  practices and leisure-time activities as groups of predictor variables. al monitoring was the only variable among various  practices that significantly predicted positive and negative aspects of adolescent behaviour. Lower monitoring was related to lower school achievement and more frequent substance use. Besides lower al monitoring, inadequate support from the same sex  was a significant predictor of drug use among adolescents. An unorganised pattern of after school activities named going out and having fun was the most significant predictor of a lower school achievement and more frequent substance use, while adolescents' involvement in creative and extracurricular activities and higher interest in reading and cultural activities was related to a higher school achievement. Additional analyses revealed that s influence adolescents' psychosocial adjustment indirectly, by directing their  into various after school activities. The  are discussed in accordance with theoretical models that point out to the joint influence of s and peers in adolescent psychosocial development."
Influences on Food Away from Home Feeding Practices Among English and Spanish Speaking Parent-Child Dyads,2015,"One contributor to increased caloric consumption and obesity rates is food consumed away from home. Families are increasingly consuming food away from home (FAFH), contributing to increased daily energy consumption and the obesity epidemic. The interplay between feeding  and co-decision making between  and  dyads when eating FAFH is not understood. The   describes in-depth qualitative information about influential factors related to family feeding practices among low-income English and Spanish speaking families with school-aged  when eating FAFH. 20 - dyads (10 English-speaking, 10 Spanish-speaking) completed key-informant interviews about factors related to family feeding practices when eating food away. Interviews were independently coded for meaning units by two coders. Themes that emerged from the interviews included: decision making when dining out, al practices and feeding , use of and opinions about kid's menus, and overall influences on food choices. Many s had recommendations for healthier kid's menu options and overall, Spanish-speaking families tended to eat out fewer times a week and cooked more family meals. This  elucidated rules and policies set by s around food away from and inside the home as well as the factors that influenced ordering at restaurants. Further studies should explore the cultural value of food in Latino cultures, and the ant dietary behaviors. Decision-making between  and  dyads about menu ordering at restaurants is complex. The  of this  can be considered for future  in understanding the decision-making process for English- and Spanish-speaking - dyads when ordering from a restaurant menu."

The theoretical analyses and  that were carried out (N=238, Poland) on youth people aged between thirteen and eighteen have made if possible to distinguish four different educational : neglectful, controlling, controlling-supporting, and partnership. Each is characterized by a variation in the specifics of the   relationship, differing dynamics, the scope of educational influence in the family home, differing understandings of the significance of new mobile and web media, the varying knowledge of s regarding their 's e-activity in the context of online safety, and the competences that determine the development of safe forms of e-activity. The gathered data imply that one of the significant factors that protect teenagers from the electronic threats is s' knowledge and consequent  limits set in accordance with the ways of the new media are used in the family. Simultaneously, we need to point out that there is a further necessity to provide non-formal education among s, increasing the digital competencies in the area of threats caused by the development of the information society."

Grandmaternal and maternal ethnotheories about early  care,2008," ethnotheories re an organized set of ideas about s, , and development that are shared by members of cultural groups. Because these ideas and beliefs reflect cultural models and serve as reational frameworks for  strategies, they need to change with historical time. To analyze these changes, the authors interviewed mothers and grandmothers of 3-month-old infants in 4 different cultural environments-urban German middle-class families (41 mothers, 22 grandmothers), urban Indian middle-class families (36 mothers, 12 grandmothers), rural Cameroonian Nso families (29 mothers, 20 grandmothers), and urban Cameroonian Nso families (28 mothers, 12 grandmothers)-in regard to their ideas about infant care.

Bidirectional and interactive effects of  temperament and parenting in early hood on the trajectory of social anxiety in adolescence,,"Introduction Research suggests that certain  behaviors are best suited to promote optimal  development, depending on a 's distinctive temperamental ation. This multimethod, longitudinal  examines the interactive effect of  and temperament in early hood on the developmental trajectory of social anxiety in adolescence. Methods Longitudinal growth modeling was used to examine the developmental trajectory of  social anxiety from age 9-15 and the interactive effect of  and  temperament at 36 months on the developmental trajectory of  social anxiety from age 9-15. Results The slope of social anxiety from age 9-15 suggested a decrease in social anxiety throughout early adolescence. Furthermore, 36-month behavioral inhibition (BI) predicted the trajectory of  social anxiety from age 9-15 when s displayed low and high levels of dismissive and supportive  (at 36 months). Conclusions Results support an interactive effect of infant temperament and  in early hood (at 36 months) on the developmental trajectory of  social anxiety from age 9-15. Specifically,  suggest that engaging highly inhibited  with high supportive and low dismissive  may help reduce social anxiety over time in adolescence. Furthermore,  needs may differ for  high or low in BI to impact the developmental trajectory of social anxiety in adolescence, such that  who are high BI seem to benefit from low dismissive and high supportive , and  who are low in BI seem to benefit more from high dismissive ."
Observational measures of parenting in anxious and nonanxious mothers: Does type of task matter?,2006,"This  examined the relation between type of - interaction task and  behaviors among a predominantly African American community-based sample. Tiventy-five anxious and matched nonanxious (N = 50) mothers were videotaped with their  (Mage = 5.8years) engaging in both a structured and unstructured task. Blind raters coded 3  behaviors hypothesized to play a role in the development of  anxiety: overcontrol, anxious behavior, and criticism. Results indicated that higher levels of overcontrol, anxious behavior and criticism were found in the structured compared to unstructured task. Levels of criticism, among anxious mothers only, were significantly correlated across tasks. Results suggest that situation specific aspects of - interaction tasks may influence  behaviors. These findings help explain variations in observational  in the anxiety literature, and highlight the need for careful selection of - tasks infuture ."
Concepts of mother-infant interaction in Greece and Germany,2003,"This  deals with  from a cultural perspective. Based on Kagitcibasi's model of the autonomous relational self, the authors analyzed Greek urban middle-class mothers'  strategies and compared them with German urban middle-class mothers'  . Interactional behaviors were assessed during videotaped, free-play home observations. It was assumed that urban middle-class Greek and German mothers do not differ in their display of face-to-face context and object stimulation, both considered as supporting an independent agency, that Greek mothers modulate the face-to-face context more with facial warmth than do German mothers who on the other hand, modulate their face-to-face behavior more with experiences of contingency than do Greek mothers. The data confirm our assumptions with the exception of baby talk as a second indicator of facial warmth. The data are interpreted in terms of foundations of socialization pathways of urban families in independent and interrelated societies without denying intracultural variability."
"Self and Nature: Parental Socialization, Self-Esteem, and Environmental Values in Spanish Adolescents",2020,"Emergent  seriously questions the use of al strictness as the best  strategy in all cultural contexts. Moreover, previous  on environmental socialization offers inconsistent findings about which specific  practices would be the most appropriate for environmental socialization. The  paper aims to examine s' contribution (i.e., authoritative, indulgent, authoritarian, and neglectful) to adolescents' self-esteem and internalization of environmental values. Participants were 308 Spanish adolescents with 171 females (55.5%), between 12 and 17 years old. The four   were defined using measures of al warmth and strictness. Self-esteem was captured with global and multidimensional measures. Internalization of environmental values was evaluated by measuring the priority given to biospheric values. Results revealed a consistent pattern between   and adolescent self-esteem and internalization of environmental values. Overall, adolescents from homes characterized by al warmth (i.e., indulgent and authoritative) have higher self-esteem and greater internalization of environmental values than their counterparts. These findings clearly contrast with those obtained in other cultural contexts where al strictness is essential in achieving well-adjusted  with optimal psychosocial development."

In particular, the relationships among the coping strategies used by college students, social support, the   used by college students' mothers and fathers, college students' experience of anxiety, and academic-related stress were examined. Ninety-three undergraduate students enrolled in a psychology course at a large southeastern university completed a series of self-report questionnaires that measured the variables under . Results suggested that anxiety, problem-focused coping, and support from significant others may serve as potentially important predictors of the academic-related stress experienced by college students. Thus, identifying college students' experience with these variables and addressing these variables in practical settings may help college students alleviate their experience of academic-related stress and have a less stressful, and possibly more fulfilling, college career."
Links Between Perception of Parental Actions and Prosocial Behavior in Early Adolescence,2013,"We analyzed the links between al , practices, and empathy and specific forms of prosocial behaviors in early adolescence. The Argentine scale of perception of relationships with s for  and young adolescents, prosocial tendencies measure,  practices measure, and 's perception of al empathy were administered to a sample of 289 middle class , aged 10-16, of both sexes, from primary and secondary schools in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Correlations and hierarchical regressions were used to examine (1) relationships between al , 's perception of al empathy, al practices, and 's prosocial behavior, (2) the amount of unique prediction from al , 's perception of al empathy, and al practices to 's prosocial behavior. Results indicated that different aspects of al actions (al , practice, and empathy) have a differential relation according to the type of prosocial behavior involved. When taking these three kinds of al behavior into account, al  are related to public and responsive aspects especially through extreme control by the mother. al practices, in turn, are related mainly with anonymous and altruistic aspects, but with this latter negatively. Finally, adolescents' perception of al empathy explains added variance in all the cases, though to a lesser extent."
Parental Factors Associated with Rumination Related Metacognitive Beliefs in Adolescence,2017,"An increasing number of  studies have suggested that metacognition is associated with individuals' mental health.

In addition, al negativity was significantly associated with adolescents' positive metacognitive beliefs of rumination and al over-involvement was marginally associated with adolescents' negative metacognitive beliefs of rumination. The findings highlighted the association between al factors and adolescents' metacognitive beliefs about rumination. Implications on the prevention of adolescent's depression were discussed."
Perceived parental affectionless control is associated with high neuroticism,2017,"Objective: Depressed patients are prone to perceive that they were exposed to affectionless control by s. Meanwhile, high neuroticism is a well-established risk factor for developing depression. Therefore, this  examined whether perceived al affectionless control is associated with high neuroticism. Methods: The subjects were 664 healthy Japanese volunteers. Perceived al care and protection were assessed by the al Bonding Instrument. al rearing was categorized into either optimal  (high care/low protection) or three dysfunctional   including affectionless control (low care/high protection). Neuroticism was evaluated by the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised. Results: The subjects with paternal affectionless control had higher neuroticism scores than those with paternal optimal . Similar tendency was observed in maternal rearing. Neuroticism scores increased in a stepwise manner with respect to the increase in the number of s with affectionless control. Conclusion: The   shows that perceived al affectionless control is associated with high neuroticism, suggesting that this al  increases neuroticism in recipients."
Habitus and the accomplishment of natural growth: Maternal parenting practices and the achievement of 'school-readiness',2014,"RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT the cognitive and developmental foundations laid down in the first two to three years of a 's life are very significant in determining future educational outcomes and life chances. These first few years, when most  spend the majority of their time at home, usually with their mothers, are vital in determining whether or not a  will be 'school-ready' when it is time for them to make the transition to formal schooling. The relationships between socioeconomic disadvantage,  practices, 'school-readiness' and future educational outcomes for  has been well ed. Understanding the factors that influence these relationships, particularly the role played by the mother's perceptions, attitudes and beliefs, is an area where further  will be of benefit. Bourdieu's (1984) theories linking 'habitus' to the reproduction of class and disadvantage through education provides the framework for this , informed by Annette Lareau's (2003) work detailing two distinct class-based  , 'concerted cultivation' and 'accomplishment of natural growth'. The  informing this paper employed qualitative interviews with five mothers living in regional Australia to gain some insights into their attitudes and practices in preparing their  for the important early life transition to school. The findings highlight the important role of a mother's own life experiences and socioeconomic status in determining these attitudes and practices and indicate a need for further  to understand how this impacts on 's school-readiness and future life course."
An ecological model to factors associated with booster seat use: A population based study,2017,"Belt-positioning booster seat use (BPB) is an effective technology to prevent severe  injury in cases of car crash. However, in many countries, age-appropriate car restraint use for  aged 4-7 years old remains the lowest among all age groups.

Psychometric Properties of the Parental Bonding Instrument in a Sample of Canadian Children,2020,"The al bonding instrument (PBI) is a self-report questionnaire that was initially designed to retrospectively assess perceived   during hood in adult respondents. Recent studies have used the PBI to assess current perception of  in . However, few studies have evaluated the psychometric properties of the PBI in . This  examined the factor structure and reliability of the PBI in a sample of Canadian  aged 7-18 years (n = 257). Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were conducted separately for the mother and father form of the PBI and composite reliability was used to determine internal consistency of the PBI. A four-factor model (care, overprotection, autonomy, indifference) showed the best fit to the data. The PBI exhibited good internal consistency but poor convergent validity. Configural invariance was not found for the PBI between two age groups (7-12 and 13-18 years), however these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size in each age group. This  suggests the PBI may be a valid and reliable self-report measure of al bonding in  but further  is needed."
Maladaptive perfectionistic self-representations: The mediational link between psychological control and adjustment,2005,"This  examined the role of maladaptive perfectionism in the relation between perceived al psychological control and both self-esteem and depression. In line with our hypotheses. evidence was found for the mediating role of maladaptive perfectionism. In addition, we examined the unique contribution of psychological control in predicting severity of depression. self-esteem and maladaptive perfectionism in comparison to other   dimensions and s' own maladaptive perfectionism. Although  showed significant convergence between mothers' and daughters' maladaptive perfectionism, psychological control was found to predict daughters' perfectionism in addition to their mothers' perfectionism. Finally, psychological control predicted severity of depression: self-esteem and maladaptive perfectionism in addition to other  dimensions (i.e.. responsiveness and behavioral control). These findings suggest that the hypothesized pathway of al reations over maladaptive perfectionistic self-reations to adjustment may apply specificallly to the influence of psychological control.

"The Longitudinal Association Between Preadolescent Facial Emotion Identification and Family Factors, and Psychotic Experiences in Adolescence (The TRAILS Study)",2020,"The current  examines whether facial emotion identification and family factors at preadolescence (age 11) predict psychotic experiences 5 years later during adolescence (age 16) and whether family factors may mediate the association between facial emotion identification and psychotic experiences. Data was obtained from the epidemiological cohort TRAILS (N = 2059). At preadolescence, a facial emotion identification test and three questionnaires to assess family functioning, perceived   and  stress, were administered. At adolescence, a questionnaire on psychotic experiences was administered. Facial emotion identification at preadolescence was not associated with psychotic experiences at adolescence, and the mediational role of family functioning was not further explored. However, increased overprotective  at preadolescence was associated with a higher frequency of psychotic experiences and delusions at adolescence. Future  may examine the mechanism behind the role of overprotective  on psychotic experiences during adolescence."

We examined al psychological control and autonomy support as a mechanism between interal conflict and perfectionism dimensions. With structural equation modeling,  showed that psychological control was associated with personal standard, concern over mistakes and doubts about action, whereas autonomy support was associated with personal standard and organization. Interal conflict had a direct effect on doubts about action when  was considered. In addition, interal conflict had indirect effects on personal standard through psychological control and autonomy support, and on concern over mistakes and doubts about action through psychological control. The findings of the  identified interal conflict as an important contributor to the development of perfectionism, and  behaviors as explanatory processes of the formation.

Effects of social pressure and  failure on parents' use of control: An experimental investigation,2017,"Because  has shown that controlling  is related to general and school-related maladjustment in , there is a need to examine antecedents of controlling . In this , we addressed the role of two sources of pressure (i.e., social pressure eliciting ego-involvement and  failure) on s' situational use of control. 124 s worked with their 5th or 6th grade  on a puzzle task. The two sources of pressure were induced experimentally in a 2 x 2 design, with s receiving instructions eliciting either ego involvement or task-involvement and with  either failing or succeeding in the task. Following the task, there was a free choice period in which dyads could choose whether or not to make additional puzzles. In both phases of the experiment, we coded s' controlling interaction , dyadic reciprocity, performance, and s' and 's engagement. Additionally, in the free-choice period the dyads' degree of persistence was registered. While induced  failure was related positively to s' controlling  during the initial puzzle activity, induced social pressure was related to s' controlling  in the free-choice period. In turn, a controlling  was related negatively to performance, reciprocity, and engagement. The findings confirm that s' use of a controlling  is a multi-determined phenomenon affected by different sources of pressure and undermining 's performance and engagement."

There is scant  on maternal fatigue and its impact on the caregiving environment for either well women or women with chronic illnesses. The objective of this  was to examine the role maternal fatigue played in the caregiving environment, specifically in the mother's experience of the daily hassles of , the discipline  she employed, and how she monitored her 's whereabouts. Two-hundred sixty-two mothers participated in this : 103 mothers with multiple sclerosis (MS), 68 mothers with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and a comparison group of 91 well mothers. Mothers completed questionnaires assessing their self-reported levels of fatigue, depression, quality and quantity of sleep,  daily hassles, discipline , and monitoring. After sleep, depression, and number of  were controlled for, fatigue explained additional variance in predicting monitoring for all three groups of mothers. Fatigue was  a significant predictor of  daily hassles for both well mothers and mothers with RA, but not for mothers with MS. For mothers with MS, it was the covariates (i.e., the number of  in the family and sleep quality and quantity) that were predictive of  daily hassles. Several explanations for mothers with MS not being as influenced by fatigue are discussed."

The relationship between adult attachment and depression in Korean mothers during the first 2 years postpartum: A moderated mediation model of self-esteem and maternal efficacy,2015,"This  examined a possible pathway to better understand the relationships between attachment schema and maternal depression through self-esteem and maternal self-efficacy. Questionnaires regarding attachment , self-esteem, maternal self-efficacy, and depression were completed by 176 mothers who visited paediatrics centres. The  showed that self-esteem fully mediated the relationship between preoccupied attachment and maternal depression and partially mediated the association between fearful attachment and maternal depression. The mediating effects of self-esteem in the relationship between insecure attachments (preoccupied and fearful types) were moderated by the mother's  efficacy. More specifically, mothers with high maternal efficacy (scores >= 32, upper 10th percentile) were protected from the detrimental impact of attachment insecurity and low self-esteem on maternal depression, compared with mothers with low -efficacy. Maternal depression benefits from intervention targeting the mother's  efficacy. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

This article reports on a grounded-theory  that examined fathers' gender identity and the way they interpreted their role as a father. While endorsing some essential male and female gender characteristics,  indicate that fathers transcend traditional male stereotypes and embrace the opportunity for a more intimate and involved  of ."
The relation between parental coping styles and parent- interactions before and after treatment for  with ADHD and oppositional behavior,2004,"This  examined the relation between al coping , discipline, and  behavior before and after participating in a  training program for s of  with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and oppositional behavior For mothers, use of more maladaptive and less adaptive coping  was related to more self-reported lax and overreactive discipline, more observed coercive , and more observed  misbehavior prior to  training. No significant relations were found for mothers following  training after controlling for pretreatment variables. For fathers, use of more maladaptive and less adaptive coping  was related to self-reported lax discipline before and after  training. Contrary to prediction, fathers who reported less seeking support and adaptive-focused coping showed the most improvement in their 's behavior Most  remained significant after controlling for self-reported depression. Implications for improving  training  and programs were discussed."
Sleep duration differences between  of migrant and native origins,2015,"Aim To explore whether primary school  of migrant and native Dutch origins differ regarding their sleep duration per night, a risk for overweight and obesity, and to determine to what degree differences in   contribute to these differences. Subjects and methods A cross-sectional survey, including 1, 943  aged 8-9 years old and their primary caregivers, was performed. Data were collected from primary schools in cities and adjacent municipalities in The Netherlands: Eind-hoven and Rotterdam. The outcome measure was mean sleep duration per night. The main independent variable was migrant background, based on the country of birth of the s. A possible mediating variable was   (rejecting, neglecting, permissive, authoritarian, authoritative). Age and sex of the  as well as al socioeconomic status, as indicated by educational level, were added as confounders. Results Dutch  have the highest sleep duration: more than 11 h (mean=670.1; SD=27.7). All migrant  show less than 11 h of sleep per night. Migrant  of non-Western origin, especially Turkish and Moroccan , show the lowest sleep duration per night.   do not contribute to these differences. Conclusion Migrant background is associated with sleep duration. As  of migrant origin are, in general, at higher risk for overweight and obesity and sleep duration is regarded as a risk factor for overweight and obesity, further investigation of this association is needed."
The relative contribution of parenting practices in predicting trait emotional intelligence in an Italian adolescent sample,2019,"This  examines the relationship between trait emotional intelligence (trait EI), support, and al psychological control practices. Three hundred adolescents, between 11 and 13 years old, took part in the  (163 were males and 137 were females). Participants completed the Perceptions of s Scales for the al support, the Dependency (DPC)- and Achievement (APC)-oriented Psychological Control Scales for the al psychological control, and the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Child Form for the 's trait EI. Trait EI was related to  variables, and , al practices (both support and psychological control) predicted global trait EI in adolescents. Some gender-specific differences were found: both APC and DPC were negative predictors of trait EI in males, whereas only APC significantly predicted trait EI in females. Future longitudinal studies are needed to examine these  and to shed light on the processes involved in the development of trait EI. Statement of contribution What is already known on the subject? There exists strong evidence of the interaction between  practices and emotional development in  and adolescents. Therefore, al psychological control is negatively correlated with peer support and self-esteem, and positively related to anxiety and aggressive behaviour in . However, there is paucity on  examining the relationship between  and trait EI in . What does this  adds? This  extends earlier work in this field and investigates whether there is a relationship between trait EI and  practices (al support and psychological control) and whether it depends on  and  gender. This , therefore, aims to investigate, for the first time, al factors that may, in addition to those constitutional, be related to trait EI in . Specifically, the objective of the   was to investigate whether  practices would predict adolescents' trait EI and whether these relations depend on the gender."
Interdependencies among interparental discord and parenting practices: The role of adult vulnerability and relationship perturbations,2004,"We examined the nature and directionality of associations between interal discord and  practices in a sample of 227 mothers and fathers of kindergarten  over two measurement waves spaced 1 year apart. Cross-lagged models indicated that associations between interal discord and maternal and paternal  practices (i.e., acceptance, discipline) were generally negligible with one exception: interal discord at Time 1 predicted decreases in maternal acceptance from Time 1 to Time 2. However, consistent with the family systems conceptualization of the family as an open system, prospective associations among interal and - subsystems varied significantly as a function of al depressive symptoms, interal relationship insecurity, and -rearing disagreements. The moderating role of adult characteristics commonly varied across the type of adult vulnerability (e.g., depressive symptoms, interal relationship insecurity, -rearing disagreements), dimension of  practices (e.g., maternal and paternal acceptance and inconsistent discipline), and the directionality of the paths between interal and - subsystems."
Parenting in the Age of High-Stakes Testing: Gifted and Talented Admissions and the Meaning of Parenthood,2017,"Background/Context: This work contributes to the growing body of scholarly and popular literature on middle-class al anxiety and competition to ensure their 's academic success. Specifically, this  provides a better understanding of the measures s will take to obtain high status gifted and talented (G&T) placements that advantage their own  at the expense of others, which is somewhat contradictory given the growing uneasiness they feel about putting their  through the testing process-and paying for test prep-that the system ultimately rewards. By analyzing the different ways in which White s and s of color conceive of good  in the era of high-stakes testing, I demonstrate the processes in our current educational system that help to produce inequities related to race, class, and G&T identification. Purpose/Objective: This paper examines White s' beliefs about  as it relates to their school choice preferences in the segregated and stratified New York City school system. It  compares the   and school choices of lower income general education (Gen Ed) s of color. It explores how s' social constructions of where their  belong in school are tied to their beliefs about  and doing what is best for their  in a highly competitive society and city. Research Design: A qualitative case  was utilized to examine how a diverse group of 52 New York City s make sense of and interact with an elementary school that offers both a segregated G&T and a Gen Ed program. The semistructured  interview data was triangulated with school observations, a professional school-choice consultant interview, and an observation of a public school choice workshop for incoming kindergarten s led by the consultant. Findings/Results: The data show that White s believe that paying for test prep, going through the hassle of getting your  tested for G&T, and receiving a high test score are symbolic of being a good  in the system. In comparison, s of color had different conceptions of good  that did not include prepping for the G&T test or getting into the G&T program, where their  would be in the minority. White s had social networks of like-minded s pressuring them to get into the G&T program. Black and Latino s did not have the same G&T pressure from friends or family, nor did they view a G&T placement as giving their  extra advantages in terms of test scores or future schooling opportunities. Conclusions/Recommendations: The findings suggest that the pressure for  to succeed on a single test feeds into al anxiety and competition regarding getting their  into the high-status G&T program. Instead of trying to avoid an overly anxious  culture, the White advantaged s in this setting get swept up in the test-prepping fad because everyone else is doing it and because of the competitive nature of obtaining a G&T seat. If policy officials want to attack the root of the G&T segregation problem, the city should consider phasing out district G&T programs altogether and instituting school-wide G&T magnets instead."
Differential Trajectories of Alcohol-Related Behaviors Across the First Year of College by Parenting Profiles,2014,"This  examined the extent to which profiles of perceived  are associated with trajectories of alcohol-related behaviors across the first year of college. Participants were surveyed five times from the summer before college to the fall of the second year. A total 285 college students were enrolled from the incoming classes of consecutive cohorts of students at a large, public university in the Northeastern United States. At baseline, participants provided information on their s' alcohol-related behaviors (e. g., al modeling of use; perceived approval of underage use) and  characteristics (e. g., al monitoring; - relationship quality). Students  reported on their personal alcohol-related behaviors at each time point. Latent profile analysis was used to identify four subgroups based on the set of  characteristics: High Quality (14%) - highest -teen relationship quality; High Monitoring (31%) - highest al monitoring and knowledge; Low Involvement (30%) - poor relationship quality, little monitoring and communication; and Pro-Alcohol (21%) - highest al modeling and approval. Students were then assigned to profiles, and their alcohol-related behaviors were examined longitudinally using latent growth curve modeling. In general, students in the Pro-Alcohol profile displayed the highest baseline levels of typical weekend drinking, heavy episodic drinking, and peak blood alcohol content, in addition to showing steeper increases in typical weekend drinking across the first year of college. Results support the notion that al behaviors remain relevant across the first year of college. Differential alcohol-related behaviors across  profiles highlight the potential for tailored college intervention."
The role of behavioral inhibition and parenting for an unfavorable emotional trauma response and PTSD,2015,"ObjectiveThe role of behavioral inhibition (BI) and  for an unfavorable emotional trauma response (DSM-IV criterion A2) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) development is unclear. MethodA community sample of adolescents and young adults (aged 14-24) was followed up over 10years (N=2378). Traumatic events, criterion A2, and PTSD (according to DSM-IV-TR) were assessed using the M-CIDI. BI and  were assessed using the Retrospective Self-Report of Inhibition and the Questionnaire of Recalled  Rearing Behavior. Multiple logistic regressions adjusted for sex, age, and number of traumata were used to examine associations of BI as well as maternal and paternal overprotection, rejection, and reduced emotional warmth with (i) criterion A2 in those with trauma (N=1794) and (ii) subsequent PTSD in those with criterion A2 (N=1160). ResultsBehavioral inhibition (BI; odds ratio, OR = 1.32) and paternal overprotection (OR = 1.27) predicted criterion A2 in those with trauma, while only BI (OR = 1.53) predicted subsequent PTSD. BI and paternal emotional warmth interacted on subsequent PTSD (OR=1.32), that is, BI only predicted PTSD in those with low paternal emotional warmth. ConclusionOur findings suggest that BI and adverse  increase the risk of an unfavorable emotional trauma response and subsequent PTSD. Paternal emotional warmth buffers the association between BI and PTSD development."
"Poor parenting as an adult problem behavior: General deviance, deviant attitudes, inadequate family support and bonding, or just bad parents?",1999,"Theoretically appropriate constructs have not been fully established for deviant adult roles. The authors tested (a) whether poor  reflects general deviance, (b) whether associations between poor  and other adult deviant behaviors could be accounted for by deviant attitudes, and (c) whether these adult roles could be predicted from family support and bonding during adolescence. Data from a community sample of 199 ethnically diverse mothers revealed that Poor  was related to more Polydrug Problems, more Property Crimes, and less Social Conformity. These correlations were accounted for by a higher order factor of General Deviance, although deviant attitudes did not explain the associations among behaviors. Specific correlations delineated associations between types of  and deviance. Adolescent family support and bonding reduced mother's Poor  and was unrelated to other adult deviant behaviors."
Coping and care-related stress in parents of a  with autism spectrum disorder,2018,"Background and Objectives:  a  with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is challenging and can  in elevated levels of  stress. This  investigated the relationship between -ratings of their 's ASD symptoms and two conceptually different measures of  stress: One specific to the ASD context and the other a general stress measure applicable to the broader caregiving context. Additionally, the influence of coping  on the relationship between 's ASD symptoms and  stress was investigated.Design and Methods: Using an internet survey, s (N=178) caring for a  with ASD reported on coping strategies, completed two measures of  stress, and assessed their 's ASD symptoms.Results:  stress increased with severity of the 's ASD symptoms, but the strength of this relationship depended on whether a general or disorder-specific measure of  stress was used. Regression analyses indicated that some coping strategies moderated the impact of ASD symptom severity on the 's care-related stress, but moderation depended on how stress was conceptualized.Conclusion: This  reinforces the importance of identifying the coping strategies of s of  with developmental disorders, and highlights the consequences of using different conceptual approaches to measure  stress."
Young people's perspectives of being parented in critical situations: teenage non-offenders and desisters speak out,2013,"This paper considers young people's perspectives of being ed and draws on a  that comprised secondary analysis of 112 qualitative interviews with teenagers who had either never offended or who had ceased to offend for at least a year. Young people's offending behaviour has traditionally been linked to  , but it is  practices that proved central to al responses to revelations about their offspring's offending. During the interviews, desisters gave accounts of their upbringing and, in particular, the  they experienced in one critical situation, namely when their offending came to light. At this point, s of desisters were reported to be more punitive, more emotional and less measured than they were customarily, and non-offenders anticipated similar reactions from their s if they were to offend in the future. The relevance of the findings for professional interventions, especially  programmes, and for social workers in  protection is discussed, and suggestions for further  is made."
A Randomized Controlled Trial of Group Triple P With Chinese Parents in Mainland China,2016,"This  evaluated the effects of Group Triple P with Chinese s on  and  outcomes as well as outcomes relating to  academic learning in Mainland China. Participants were 81 Chinese s and their  in Shanghai, who were randomly allocated to an intervention group or wait-list control group. s in the intervention condition received Group Triple P training, and s and  were assessed at three/two time points. Compared with the control group, s in the intervention group reported significant improvements in  adjustment problems,  practices, al adjustment, and  self-efficacy at post-assessment. Moreover, there was a significant increase in s' satisfaction with 's academic achievement and a reduction in 's academic problem behaviors at post-intervention. All these effects were maintained at 6-month follow-up. There was  a significant increase in the  report of positive  at post-intervention."
Callous-Unemotional Traits are Associated With Child-to-Parent Aggression,,"This  examined the relations between callous-unemotional traits and perpetration of aggression toward s in two separate studies, while  considering motivation for aggression and   experienced among young people. Study 1 involved 60 s of  aged between 11 and 17 years old. The online  found high callous-unemotional traits, as reported by s, to be associated with aggression toward both s. Both types of motivation (proactive and reactive, as reported by s) were associated with aggression toward s. Study 2 involved 42 youths from an alternative education sample (between 11 and 16 years old). Youths with higher self-reported callous-unemotional traits reported more aggression toward both s. Both studies, which had different reporters and different samples, showed youths with higher callous-unemotional traits were more aggressive toward their s. In discussing the , we note the importance of including callous-unemotional traits in future  on -directed aggression and in studies on domestic violence more broadly."
Development of Physical Activity-Related Parenting Practices Scales for Urban Chinese Parents of Preschoolers: Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Reliability,2017,"Background: Valid instruments of  practices related to 's physical activity (PA) are essential to understand how s affect preschoolers' PA. This  developed and validated a questionnaire of PA-related  practices for Chinese-speaking s of preschoolers in Hong Kong. Methods: s (n = 394) completed a questionnaire developed using findings from formative qualitative  and literature searches. Test-retest reliability was determined on a subsample (n = 61). Factorial validity was assessed using confirmatory factor analysis. Subscale internal consistency was determined. Results: The scale of  practices encouraging PA comprised 2 latent factors: Modeling, structure and participatory engagement in PA (23 items), and Provision of appropriate places for 's PA (4 items). The scale of  practices discouraging PA scale encompassed 4 latent factors: Safety concern/overprotection (6 items), Psychological/behavioral control (5 items), Promoting inactivity (4 items), and Promoting screen time (2 items). Test-retest reliabilities were moderate to excellent (0.58 to 0.82), and internal subscale reliabilities were acceptable (0.63 to 0.89). Conclusion: We developed a theory-based questionnaire for assessing PA-related  practices among Chinese-speaking s of Hong Kong preschoolers. While some items were context and culture specific, many were similar to those previously found in other populations, indicating a degree of construct generalizability across cultures."
"Associations between gaming disorder, parent- relationship, parental supervision, and discipline styles: Findings from a school-based survey during the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam",2021,"Background and aims: Vietnam implemented numerous measures to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 among school students, including -at-home/self-quarantine. During the -at-home period, adolescents may engage in more video gaming than usual, potentially contributing to gaming disorder. However, the regionally-reative prevalence of gaming disorder and its asso-ciation with  practice and discipline practice have not been described. We assessed the prevalence of gaming disorder among Vietnamese adolescents during the initial 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associations between gaming disorder and  practice and discipline practice. Methods: We conducted a school-based, self-administered cross-sectional survey of 2,084 students in Hanoi, Vietnam (response rate = 97.1%). The survey included standardized in-struments translated from English to Vietnamese. We performed multilevel logistic regressions to assess the associations between  practice, discipline practice, and gaming disorder. Results: The prevalence of gaming disorder among the respondents was 11.6%. Healthy - relationship was protective against gaming disorder (Adj OR = 0.36; 95% CI = 0.21, 0.62). Non-supervision, non-discipline, violent discipline were positively associated with gaming disorder. Discussion and Conclusions: We found associations between gaming disorder and - relationship, al supervision, and al discipline. Future interventional studies should consider assessing the effect of fostering healthy - relationships and appropriate discipline on the occurrence or prognosis of gaming disorders."
The influence of temperament style on a student's choice of and performance in a computer programming course,2008,"This  is an attempt to determine whether it is necessary to include temperament  when compiling an instrument to predict a student's chances of success in a computer programming course. Temperament  is seen as the combination of qualities which constitute the natural disposition of an individual and which affect actions, thinking and emotions. The DISC model, as adapted by Boyd [Boyd, C. F. (1994). Different , different needs: the art of adjustable . Oregon: Questar Publishers Inc.], views people as behaving along two orthogonal dimensions: the speed at which a person moves through life, and his/her general focus when doing things, i.e. on people or on tasks. This  proved that both of these dimensions have an influence on the performance of students in a computer programming course while one of them  has an influence on a student's choice to pursue a programming course.

"The role of hope as a mediator in recollected parenting, adult attachment, and mental health",2003,"Because having hope is requisite for the establishment of satisfying adulthoods, factors contributing to its development must be understood. Using structural equation modeling, the current  tested propositions that hope (1) develops in the context of a secure relationship with a supportive adult in hood (Snyder, 1994), and (2) mediates the relationship between developmental processes and adult mental health outcomes. There was a good fit of the data to the hypothesized model. Adult attachment mediated the relationship between  and hope, and hope partially mediated the relationship between attachment and mental health. The developmental trajectory of hope is discussed as it relates to  and attachment, and a tripartite approach is suggested for developing primary and tertiary interventions for at-risk youth."
Family Risk Factors Associated With Aggressive Behavior in Chinese Preschool Children,2016,"Purpose: The  explored family predictors of aggressive behavior in preschool  in China. Design and Methods: Using a stratified cluster sampling method, 1382 preschool  were recruited from ten kindergarten schools in Shanghai, China. Their s completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)-aggression subscale, the  Behavior Inventory, the Family Environment Scale, and a demographic questionnaire. Results: The mean age of the 1382  was 4.97 years (SD =.88), with 55.1% (762) boys, and 44.9% (620) girls. According to the CBCL, the prevalence of aggressive behavior in preschool  was 12.4%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that family conflicts (OR = 1.231, 95% CI: 1.115- 1.360), hostile/coercive  (OR = 1.083, 95% CI: 1.051- 1.116), inconsistent  between grands and s (OR = 1.658, 95% CI: 1.175- 2.341), and more time spent watching TV (OR = 1.999, 95% CI: 1.568-2.550) significantly predicted aggressive behavior of . Conclusions: Children with more family conflicts who experience hostile/coercive  were more likely to engage in aggressive behavior. Moreover, inconsistent  attitudes between grands and s, and excessive TV exposure  contributed to hood aggression. Given that the  of this  show a high prevalence of aggressive behavior in preschool , future  must pay greater attention to this aspect. Practice Implications: Family risk factors identified as relevant to 's aggression in this  provide avenues to develop family-focused strategies for curbing aggression in preschool .

A Cluster-Randomized Evaluation of a Responsive Stimulation and Feeding Intervention in Bangladesh,2011,"OBJECTIVES: The goal of this  was to determine if a responsive stimulation and feeding intervention improved developmental and nutritional outcomes compared with a regular information-based  program. The hypothesis was that mothers in the intervention would exhibit better  skills and  would exhibit better developmental and nutritional outcomes than controls. METHODS: A cluster-randomized field trial was conducted with 302  aged 8 to 20 months and their mothers in rural Bangladesh who were randomly assigned according to village to 1 of 3 groups. The control mothers received 12 informational sessions on health and nutrition. The intervention groups received an additional 6 sessions delivered by peer educators who included modeling and coached practice in self-feeding and verbal responsiveness with the  during play. A second intervention group received, along with the sessions, 6 months of a food powder fortified with minerals and vitamins. Developmental outcomes included the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) Inventory, mother- responsive talk, and language development. Nutritional outcomes included weight, height, self-feeding, and mouthfuls eaten. We used analysis of covariance to compare the 3 groups at the posttest and at follow-up, covarying the pretest levels and confounders. RESULTS: At follow-up, responsive stimulation-feeding groups had better HOME inventory scores, responsive talking, language, mouthfuls eaten, and hand-washing. Micronutrient fortification ed in more weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: A brief behavior-change program that focused on modeling and practice in stimulation and feeding was found to benefit 's nutrition and language development. Micronutrients benefited 's weight but not length. Pediatrics 2011;127:e1191-e1197"
"The relationship between the broader autism phenotype,  severity, and stress and depression in parents of  with autism spectrum disorders",2011,"This  examined the relationship between  symptom severity,  broader autism phenotype (BAP), and stress and depression in s of  with ASD. One hundred and forty-nine s of  with ASD completed a survey of  stress, depression, broader autism phenotype, coping , perceived social support, and  symptom severity. s reported elevated  stress and depression relative to normative samples. A path analysis indicated that both  symptom severity and  BAP were positively correlated with these outcomes. The relationship between BAP and the outcome measures was partially mediated by maladaptive coping and social support and the relationship between  symptom severity and outcomes was partially mediated by social support.

Factors of perceived parental rearing styles: the EMBU-C examined in a sample of Dutch primary school ,2003,"The aim of the   was to explore the dimensional framework underlying the original item pool of 81 items of the Dutch EMBU-C in a large sample of primary school aged  (n = 824). It was demonstrated that the full range of 81 items of the Dutch EMBU-C, could be reduced to four reliable factors, Emotional Warmth, Rejection, Overprotection and Favouring Subject. It was shown that the EMBU-C Scales for  have conceptually much in common with their adult and adolescent counterparts. Thus, the EMBU-C can be considered to be a suitable measure examining whether relations between psychological disorders and the perception of  , as found in older subjects., can be confirmed in hood. Preliminary  showed that the associations between perceived , as measured by the EMBU-C, and trait anxiety in , as measured with the STAIC, are consistent with findings yielded in studies with adults where anxious individuals expressed that they had been reared in a more rejective and protected way than their non-anxious equivalents.

Associations Between Parental BMI and the Family Nutrition and Physical Activity Environment in a Community Sample,2017,"The purpose of this  was to examine the relationship between al BMI and the family environment and determine if differences exist in  diet and physical activity related  behaviors by al BMI in a community sample of families recruited through elementary schools in a local school district. We found an association between al BMI category and family nutrition and physical activity (FNPA) score. Families with an underweight or normal weight  had a larger proportion (64.3%) of high (indicating a healthier family environment) FNPA scores and families with an overweight or obese  had a smaller proportion (45.2%) of high FNPA scores (chi (2) = 5.247, P = 0.022). Families with a  who was overweight or obese had 2.18 times the odds (95% CI 1.11-4.27) of being in the low FNPA (less healthy environment) group. Further, underweight/normal weight s reported higher levels of monitoring of  diet (Z = -3.652, P < 0.0001), higher levels of al monitoring of  physical activity (Z = -3.471, p < 0.001), and higher levels of al limit setting related to  sedentary activities compared to overweight/obese s (Z = -2.443, P = 0.01).  BMI and  behaviors are known to have a major impact on hood obesity. In this , lower  BMI and authoritative  behaviors were associated with a less obesogenic home environment and a positive   related to  eating and physical activity behaviors."
THE FORGOTTEN BONDS: THE ASSESSMENT AND CONTEMPLATION OF SIBLING ATTACHMENT IN DIVORCE AND PARENTAL SEPARATION,2011,"Attachment theory is increasingly being considered when contemplating post-divorce  plans. Historically, there has been a strong emphasis on assessing the strength of the - bond as well as a 's attachment . Surprisingly little  has focused on sibling bonds and the implications for post-divorce  plans. This article provides an overview of sibling attachment theory, sibling attachment considerations in foster care decisions, and the limited  examining sibling attachment in divorce and  schedules.

ConclusionsFamily functioning may be screened in  with encopresis, especially when standard interventions have had limited success. Identification and treatment of familial factors may enhance the treatment efficacy in encopresis."
Culture beats gender? The importance of controlling for identity- and parenting-related risk factors in adolescent psychopathology,2018,"This  analyzed the unique effects of gender and culture on psychopathology in adolescents from seven countries after controlling for factors which might have contributed to variations in psychopathology. In a sample 2259 adolescents (M = 15 years; 54% female) from France, Germany, Turkey, Greece, Peru, Pakistan, and Poland identity stress, coping with identity stress, maternal  (support, psychological control, anxious rearing) and psychopathology (internalizing, externalizing and total symptomatology) were assessed. Due to variations in stress perception, coping  and maternal behavior, these covariates were partialed out before the psychopathology scores were subjected to analyses of variance with gender and country as factors. These analyses leveled out the main effect of country and revealed country-specific gender effects. In four countries, males reported higher internalizing and total symptomatology than females. Partialing out the covariates ed in a clearer picture of culture-specific and gender dependent effects on psychopathology, which is helpful in designing interventions."
"SOCIAL ANXIETY AND PERCEPTION OF EARLY PARENTING AMONG AMERICAN, CHINESE-AMERICAN, AND SOCIAL PHOBIC SAMPLES",1994,"Emotionally distant and controlling -rearing attitudes have been reported to characterize the s of American or western European social phobics in previous . However the notion that these al attitudes may be associated with social anxiety only in some cultures has not been investigated The   examined social anxiety among American social phobics and American and Chinese/Chinese American volunteer samples and how it may relate to their s' -rearing attitudes. Multivariate analyses of variance revealed overall group differences. Both volunteer samples reported lower levels of anxiety than social phobics. s of Chinese/Chinese Americans and social phobics were reported to be similar in their (1) isolation of  from social activities; (2) over-emphasis of others' opinions; and (3) use of shame tactics for discipline (more so than American volunteers' s). However s of nonsocial phobics were more likely to attend family social activities than social phobics' s Overall, the association between a reported   emphasizing others' opinions and shame tactics and social anxiety in their adult  was more evident in both American samples than among Chinese/Chinese Americans.

Parenting and adolescent adjustment: The mediational role of family self-esteem,2021,"The   analyzes the relationship between al socialization practices, acceptance/involvement, and strictness/imposition, and different indicators of adolescent adjustment, taking into account the role of family self-esteem. A sample of 848 Spanish adolescents (54.70% females) ranging in age from 14 to 18 years old (M = 16.11, SD = 1.10) participated in the . A series of structural equations models (SEMs) were tested to examine the mediational role of family self-esteem in the relationship between  practices and the outcome variables that capture adolescent adjustment: emotional instability, antisocial behavior, and academic achievement. The influence of al practices on adolescent adjustment is expected to take place through family self-esteem. The  showed that the effect of acceptance/involvement and strictness/imposition practices on emotional instability, antisocial behavior, and academic achievement was mediated by family self-esteem. Family self-esteem eliminates the previous direct relationships between al practices and all the adolescent adjustment variables, except the one between acceptance/involvement and emotional instability, which was reduced but not eliminated. Acceptance/involvement practices positively influence adolescents' adjustment via family self-esteem, whereas strictness/imposition practices negatively influence adolescents' adjustment via family self-esteem. This  contributes to clarifying the relationship between al practices and adolescent adjustment, considering family self-esteem as a mediational variable rather than as an adolescent adjustment indicator. The  findings and their implications for  science are discussed."

The aim of this  has been to examine the relation between the adolescents' perception about  practices, and their involvement in cyberbullying, bearing in mind both girls' and boys' gender and progenitors' gender. The sample comprised 2060 Spanish secondary school students (47.9% girls; Mage = 14.34). Two-way ANOVA and binary logistic regression analyses were carried out. An effect of the interaction between sex and cyberbullying roles in maternal affection and communication, inductive discipline, and psychological control, as well as paternal promotion of autonomy and psychological control, was found. In general, it can be observed that the more negative  were found in cyber-aggressors, especially when this role is assumed by girls. The  of logistic regression analysis suggest that  practices explain better cyberbullying involvement in girls compared to boys, finding some important differences between both sexes regarding protective and risk factors. These findings highlight the importance of  practices to explain cyberbullying involvement, which supports the necessity of including family among the addresses of intervention programs."
Psychological variables trunks in the development of social skills: differential study in  and adolescents diagnosed with Turner syndrome,2013,"Turner syndrome is a chromosomal disorder, not inheritable, determined by the total or partial deletion of the X chromosome in females. The physical and psychological characteristics of women with this diagnosis may affect the capacity and quality of their social relationships. At the same time, the transition from hood to adolescence involves major changes that directly affect social development and that could adversely affect, if not has a series of protective factors that buffer their effects. The aim of this  is to evaluate in  and adolescents diagnosed with Turner Syndrome protection and vulnerability trunk factors in the development of core social skills, by exploring the differential impact of measures such as self-concept, perceived  , coping strategies and stress school in relation to evolutionary variables. This investigation worked with a purposive sample of  and adolescents diagnosed with Turner Syndrome; in all variables analyzed differences may be attributed to the development stage, allowing the analysis of the differential impact of these factors in hood and adolescence. These data are useful for understanding the vulnerability of this population in relation to the assessment made of themselves in different evolutionary periods of his life, increasing, at the same time, knowledge of genetics and environment dialectic."
Educational competence of parents with  participating in youth welfare measures,2013,"Objective: The  examines the influence of specific risks on  at the beginning of youth welfare measures. Method: Family risk factors as well as al behaviour  of N = 74 s were assessed with standardized questionnaires. Results: The  were evaluated cross-sectionally with one-way factor analysis. Three groups were formed according to degree of risk factors. Families with special risks, i.e., material needs, physically ill s, or single s, show a significantly lower level of  competence. Differences in negative  features are not found to be under the influence of specific risks. Conclusions: s of  in youth welfare measures who are specifically stressed may need special training to increase their  skills, especially when pre-post comparisons show lower  quality in the group with specific risk factors at the end of an intervention."
"The effects of parental feeding styles, 's self-efficacy and social anxiety on adolescent obesity",2017,"Objective To examine the effect of al feeding  and 's self-efficacy and social anxiety on adolescent obesity. Methods The samples of this descriptive and cross-sectional  were collected by using a simple sampling method. The  group was composed of 649 Turkish secondary schools students and their s. Three secondary schools were selected from both rural and urban areas of the province. Data of the  were collected with the - socio-demographic data collection form, the  feeding  questionnaire, the middle school self-efficacy scale and the social anxiety scale for the adolescent. To analyze the data of the , we used percentages, mean, correlation, and regression analysis. Results The average age of the students was 11.58+1.21 years and percentages of female students 55.0%. The factors that significantly affect male adolescent obesity were fear of social situations in general, interpersonal relations, preventive healthcare self-efficacy, and strict dietary control, respectively. The factors affect male adolescent obesity at the rate of 35.0%. The factors that significantly affect female adolescent obesity were fear of social situations in general, preventive healthcare self-efficacy, emotional feeding, social evasion and distress in new situations, and tolerant dietary control, respectively. These factors affect female adolescent obesity at the rate of 32.8%. Conclusion It is indicated that the obesity of  is affected by self-efficacy levels, social anxiety, and the al feeding ."
Linked lives: The intergenerational transmission of antisocial behavior,2003,"There is a strong assumption of intergenerational continuity in behavior patterns, including antisocial behavior. Using a 3-generation, prospective  design, we examine the level of behavioral continuity between Generation 2 (G2) and Generation 3 (G3), and the role of economic disadvantage and  behaviors as mediating links. We estimate separate models for G2 fathers and G2 mothers. Data are drawn from the Rochester Youth Development Study, a longitudinal  begun in 1988 during G2's early adolescence (n = 1,000), which has collected prospective data on G2, their s (G1), and now their G3 . Results show that intergenerational continuity in antisocial behavior is evident, albeit somewhat modest.   and financial stress do play a mediating role, although their effects vary by G2's gender. In general, adolescent delinquency plays a larger role in linking the generations for G2 fathers, whereas  behaviors and financial stress play a larger role for G2 mothers."
Dating violence: A cross-lag path model with pregnant and parenting adolescents,2020,"Introduction: Dating violence is a common problem among adolescents, particularly among Latinx pregnant and  adolescents, and can be detrimental to adolescent s and their . However, little is known about whether different forms of dating violence behaviors are stable over time or what influences changes in these behaviors. Therefore, the purpose of this  was to use an exploratory autoregressive cross-lag path model to analyze whether conflict resolution, verbally abusive, and physically abusive behaviors were stable over time and whether these behaviors predicted one another in the future. Method: A total of 285 pregnant or  adolescents attending eight high schools in the Southwestern U.S. completed a pre-test at the beginning of a semester, a follow-up survey at the end of the semester, and a post-test at the end of the following semester to longitudinally assess the strategies they used when resolving a conflict with their partners (i.e., conflict resolution strategies, verbally abusive behaviors, and/or physically abusive behaviors). Results and conclusions: An autoregressive cross-lag model was performed to determine whether conflict resolution, verbally abusive, and physically abusive behaviors at one time point predicted the same variables in the future. Results from the autoregressive cross-lag model indicated that adolescents' reports of their conflict resolution strategies and verbally abusive behaviors were stable across time, but their use of physically abusive behaviors were not. Additionally, conflict resolution strategies predicted lower levels of verbally abusive and physically abusive behaviors."
"OVER-TIME CHANGES IN ADJUSTMENT AND COMPETENCE AMONG ADOLESCENTS FROM AUTHORITATIVE, AUTHORITARIAN, INDULGENT, AND NEGLECTFUL FAMILIES",1994,"In a previous report, we demonstrated that adolescents' adjustment varies as a function of their s'  (e.g., authoritative, authoritarian, indulgent, neglectful). This 1-year follow-up was conducted in order to examine whether the observed differences are maintained over time. In 1987, an ethnically and socioeconomically heterogeneous sample of approximately 2,300 14-18-year-olds provided information used to classify the adolescents' families into 1 of 4   groups. That year, and again 1 year later, the students completed a battery of standardized instruments tapping psychosocial development, school achievement, internalized distress, and behavior problems. Differences in adjustment associated with variations in  are either maintained or increase over time. However, whereas the benefits of authoritative  are largely in the maintenance of previous levels of high adjustment, the deleterious consequences of neglectful  continue to accumulate."
Developmental pathway to paranoia is mediated by negative self-concept and experiential avoidance,2014,"The  investigated the role of early interactions with s in the paranoid process. Student participants (N = 302) completed questionnaires measuring al , emotional invalidation, attachment, self-esteem, experiential avoidance (EA) and paranoia. Analyses using structural equation modelling confirmed a model in which cold and overprotective  was associated with insecure attachment and negative self-views. Childhood emotional invalidation, including punishment, belittlement, and distress on the part of the s in response to 's displays of negative emotions predicted EA in later life. Negative self-beliefs and avoidance of negative mental states, in turn, predicted paranoid ideation. In line with previous , our data suggest that suboptimal  fosters paranoid thinking later in life. Our findings are  consistent with the idea that paranoia arises as a  of dysfunctional attempts to maintain a positive view of the self."
Psychometric Validation of the Parental Bonding Instrument in a UK Population-Based Sample: Role of Gender and Association With Mental Health in Mid-Late Life,2018,"The factorial structure of the al Bonding Instrument (PBI) has been frequently studied in diverse samples but no  has examined its psychometric properties from large, population-based samples. In particular, important questions have not been addressed such as the measurement invariance properties across al and offspring gender. We evaluated the PBI based on responses from a large, reative population-based sample, using an exploratory structural equation modeling method appropriate for categorical data. Analysis revealed a three-factor structure reing care, overprotection, and autonomy  . In terms of psychometric measurement validity, our  supported the complete invariance of the PBI ratings across sons and daughters for their mothers and fathers. The PBI ratings were  robust in relation to personality and mental health status. In terms of predictive value, paternal care showed a protective effect on mental health at age 43 in sons. The PBI is a sound instrument for capturing perceived  , and is predictive of mental health in middle adulthood."
Improving flexible parenting with Acceptance and Commitment Therapy: A case study,2018,"This paper describes a case  of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy applied to the problems in a mother's interaction with her family. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is implemented using metaphors and exercises in seven clinical sessions with the mother. Psychological flexibility, experiential avoidance, behavior control, acceptance of private events and coherence of valued actions were assessed. The Valued Living Questionnaire was  used. The  show a decrease in control and avoidance behavior. Both mother and son's acceptance and valued actions increased at the end of the treatment and were maintained at follow-up. The treatment established a flexible behavioral repertoire not only by the mother, who received direct intervention, but was  in her son's behavior. The effects of her treatment are reflected in her son, suggesting two-way psychological flexibility between mother and son."
Early family-based intervention in the path to alcohol problems: Rationale and relationship between treatment process characteristics and  and parenting outcomes,1999,"Objective: Risk for subsequent development of alcohol problems is not uniform across the population of alcoholic families. but varies with al comorbidity and family history. Recent studies have  identified disruptive  behavior problems in the preschool years as predictive of alcoholism in adulthood. Given the quality of risk structure in highest risk families, prevention program ming is more appropriately Family based rather than individual. Method: A family-based intervention program for the prevention of conduct problems among preschool-age sons of alcoholic fathers was implemented to change this potential mediating risk structure. A population-based recruitment strategy enrolled 52 alcoholic families in a 10-month intervention involving  training and marital problem solving. The  examined the interplay between  treatment investment and  and therapist expectations and satisfaction in predicting change in  behavior and authoritative   during the program and for 6 months afterward among the 29 families whose sustained involvement allowed these effects to be evaluated. Results:  expectations at pretreatment influenced their early investment in the program, which in turn predicted  and  outcomes.  and therapist satisfaction ratings during treatment were associated with one another and with expectations that the program would continue to promote changes in their .  investment was a particularly salient influence on outcome, as higher investment throughout the program was associated with improvement in  behavior and authoritative  at termination. Conclusions: Findings indicate that treatment process characteristics mediate the influence of baseline  functioning on treatment success and that treatment changes themselves predict later  outcomes."
Perceived parental rearing behaviours and coping in young adolescents,2004,"Relationships between al rearing practices and coping  were examined in a sample of 122 young adolescents. Subjects completed the  version of the EMBU, a self-report inventory for assessing perceptions of current  practices, and the Utrecht Coping List for Adolescents, a self-report measure of general coping dispositions. As predicted, correlational and regression analyses showed, that perceived rejection by both father and mother was significantly associated with the use of passive coping strategies. Unexpectedly, no convincing relationships were found between al emotional warmth and coping . Finally, perceived control by both s was linked to higher scores of active coping. The  findings are discussed in light of previous work in this  field. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Interparental hostility and early adolescent problem behavior: The mediating role of specific aspects of parenting,2006,"This  examines how  helps explain the contemporaneous association between interal hostility and adolescent problem behavior. A theoretical model of spillover was tested specifying five aspects of mothers' and fathers'  that might be associated with s' hostile interactions with one another: harshness, inconsistency, psychological intrusiveness, and lower levels of acceptance and monitoring knowledge. The sample consisted of 416 early adolescents and their married s. The association between interal hostility and adolescent externalizing problems was mediated uniquely by fathers' and mothers' harshness, lower levels of fathers' monitoring knowledge, and mothers' psychological intrusiveness. The association between interal hostility and adolescent internalizing was mediated uniquely by mothers' harshness, psychological intrusiveness, and lower levels of acceptance. These patterns were similar for sons and daughters."
"Psychosocial Intimacy, Relationships with Parents, and Well-being among Emerging Adults",2018,"For emerging adults, the development of psychosocial intimacy may be a key developmental task shaped by past . In this , 232 emerging adult, college students completed a questionnaire about their intimacy development, identity development, self-efficacy in romantic relationships,  (i.e., attachment , al caring and overprotection, and al challenge), and well-being (i.e, depressive symptoms, loneliness, happiness, and self-esteem). Findings indicate that identity development, low attachment avoidance, and self-efficacy in romantic relationships predicted intimacy development. Furthermore, those individuals with high intimacy have less loneliness, greater self-esteem, and more happiness than those with low intimacy. Achieving psychosocial intimacy may have benefits for well-being."
Culture-general and -specific associations of attachment avoidance and anxiety with perceived parental warmth and psychological control among Turk and Belgian adolescents,2010,"Both the adolescent peer attachment and perceived   literatures emphasize the role of the quality of the - relationship in 's healthy adjustment beyond the family, but few studies have investigated links between adolescents' peer attachment and perceptions of . We investigate relations of adolescents' perceptions of warmth and psychological control from s with avoidance and anxiety in attachment to close friends in two contrasting cultures. Altogether, 262 Turk and 263 Belgian youth between 14 and 18 years of age participated. Cross-culturally, attachment avoidance was negatively related to maternal warmth, and attachment anxiety positively related to maternal and paternal control and negatively to paternal warmth. Beyond these general relations, attachment avoidance was associated with paternal psychological control in Belgians but not in Turks. The  provides cross-cultural evidence for specific relations between peer attachment and perceived  and suggests a culture-specific pathway for the development of attachment avoidance.

The relationships of parent- and -related psychiatric conditions with oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder symptoms in  with ADHD,2021,"This cross-sectional  evaluated the impacts of maternal and paternal affective temperament traits, maternal and paternal ADHD, depression and anxiety symptoms,  , 's depression and anxiety disorder symptoms, and 's autistic traits on the oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD) symptoms of  with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Analysis showed a positive relation of maternal anxious and irritable temperament and  inattention, hyperactivity-impulsivity and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) scores on ODD scores. However, there was a negative relationship between al acceptance/involvement and ODD scores. Regarding CD scores, maternal irritable and paternal cyclothymic and hyperthymic temperament scores and  ODD and autistic trait scores showed a positive relationship, whereas maternal ADHD showed a negative relationship on CD scores.

"Maternal Perceptions of Infant Hunger, Satiety, and Pressuring Feeding Styles in an Urban Latina WIC Population",2010,"Objective.-Control ling feeding  in which s regulate feeding without responding to  cues have been associated with poor self-regulation of feeding and increased weight, but have not been well studied in infancy. We sought to assess maternal perception of infant feeding cues and pressuring feeding  in an urban Latina Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) population. Methods.-Secondary analysis of a larger  of Latina mothers participating in New York City WIC programs. We examined maternal perception of infant feeding cues and pressuring feeding . Using logistic regression, we assessed: 1) characteristics associated with perceptions of cues and pressuring to feed, including sociodemographics, breastfeeding, and maternal body mass index; and 2) whether perceptions of cues were associated with pressuring feeding . Results.-We surveyed 368 mothers (84% response rate). Most mothers perceived that babies sense their own satiety. However, 72% believed that infant crying must indicate hunger. Fifty-three percent believed that mothers should always make babies finish the bottle (pressure to feed). Pressuring feeding  was associated with foreign maternal country of birth (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 3.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.66-5.60) and less than a high school education (AOR 1.81; 95% CI, 1.12-2.91). Two perceptions of feeding cues were related to pressuring feeding : belief that infant crying must indicate hunger (AOR 2.59; 95% CI, 1.52-4.42) and infant hand sucking implies hunger (AOR 1.83; 95% CI, 1.10-3.03). Conclusions.-Maternal characteristics influence perception of infant hunger and satiety. Interpretation of feeding cues is associated with pressuring feeding . Improving responsiveness to infant cues should be a component of early hood obesity prevention."
Factors associated with early sexual initiation and unsafe sex in adolescents: Substance use and parenting style,2020,
Attachment style and coping resources as predictors of coping strategies in the transition to parenthood,2001,"The relations among adult attachment , coping resources, appraised strain, and coping strategies were examined in a prospective  of married couples having their first  (N = 92). Attachment and coping resources were measured during the second trimester of pregnancy, and  strain and coping strategies were assessed when the babies were about 6 weeks old. Results supported a theoretical model proposing that attachment is predictive of coping resources and appraised strain, and that attachment, resources, and strain are predictive of coping strategies. Results  highlighted the complexity of associations among attachment, stress, and coping: Gender differences in mean scores and predictive associations were obtained, and some interactions were found between resources and strain in predicting coping strategies. The findings support the utility of integrating theories of attachment and coping in explaining couples' adjustment to important developmental transitions."
"Maternal symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety are related to nonresponsive feeding styles in a statewide sample of WIC participants",2008,", including nonresponsive feeding , has been related to under-or overweight among young . The relationship between maternal mental health and feeding  has not been examined. We hypothesized that mothers who report more symptoms of stress, depression, or anxiety report less responsive (e.g. more controlling, indulgent, and uninvolved) feeding  than mothers who report fewer symptoms of stress, depression, or anxiety. Our analyses included 702 mother-infant pairs from a statewide sample of Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children mothers. We assessed maternal mental health and feeding  by a telephone survey. After adjusting for potential confounding variables, maternal stress symptomatology was significantly associated with forceful (beta = 0.03; 95% CI = 0.02, 0.05) and uninvolved (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.1, 1.7) feeding  scores, maternal depression symptomatology was significantly associated with forceful (,6 = 0.03; 95% CI = 0.004, 0.05), indulgent (,6 = 0.03; 95% CI 0.004, 0.06), and uninvolved (OR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.001, 2.2) feeding  scores, and maternal anxiety symptomatology was significantly related to restrictive (beta = 0.11; 95% CI = 0.01, 0.21), forceful (P = 0.04; 95% CI = 0.02,0.06), and uninvolved (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.01, 1.9) feeding  scores. Among mothers who perceived their infant as temperamentally fussy, there was a significant positive relationship between restrictive feeding  scores and 3 indices of maternal mental health (stress, beta = 0.18; 95% CI = 0.07, 0.28; depression, beta = 0.21; 95% CI = 0.04, 0.38; and cumulative mental health symptomatology, beta = 0.29; 95% CI = 0.10, 0.48). Mothers who report stress, depression, or anxiety symptoms are at risk for nonresponsive feeding . These findings provide support for broadening the focus of existing  nutrition programs to include strategies that recognize how issues of maternal mental health can affect feeding ."
Needs Analysis for a Parenting App to Prevent Unintentional Injury in Newborn Babies and Toddlers: Focus Group and Survey Study Among Chinese Caregivers,2019,"Background: With the growing popularity of mobile health technology, app-based interventions delivered by smartphone have become an increasingly important strategy toward injury prevention. Objective: This  aimed to develop a framework supporting the design of an app-based intervention to prevent unintentional injury, targeted for caregivers of Chinese  aged 0 to 6 years. Methods: A theory-based mixed-method , including focus groups and Web-based quantitative survey, was performed. Adult caregivers who care for  aged 0 to 6 years and own a smartphone were recruited into 2 sequential stages of . First, focus groups were conducted among the caregivers at community health care centers and preschools from December 2015 to March 2016. Focus groups (8-10 participants per group) explored awareness, experiences, and opinions of caregivers toward using an app to prevent unintentional injury among . Second, based on the focus groups findings, a Web-based quantitative survey was designed and distributed to caregivers in November 2016; it collected information on specific needs for the app-based intervention. Thematic analysis and quantitative descriptive analyses were performed. Results: In total, 12 focus groups were completed, involving 108 caregivers. Most participants expressed a strong desire to learn knowledge and skills about unintentional  injury prevention and held positive attitudes toward app-based interventions. Participants expressed multiple preferences concerning the app-based intervention, including their contents, functions, interactive , installation and registration logistics, and privacy protection and information security. Following the focus groups, 1505 caregivers completed a WeChat-based quantitative survey, which generated roughly similar  to those of focus groups and added numerical metrics concerning participants' preferences on what to learn, when to learn it, and how to learn it. A detailed framework was established involving 5 components: (1) content design, (2) functional design, (3) interactive , (4) installation and registration logistics, and (5) privacy protection and information security, and 15 specific requirements. Conclusions: We developed a framework that can be used as a guide to design app-based interventions for s and caregivers, specifically for unintentional injury prevention of  aged 0 to 6 years."
THE AGE OF CONCERTED CULTIVATION A Racial Analysis of Parental Repertoires and Childhood Activities,2019,"In this paper I develop a race-centered, intersectional critique of concerted cultivation. First developed by Annette Lareau in Unequal Childhoods to describe the dominant middle-class cultural  of , this powerful concept continues to shape scholarship on  and the social reproduction of social inequality through culture and class. I critique and reconstruct this concept based upon: 1) Existing  on racial identity and racial socialization, and racialized  techniques, and 2) Alternative readings of selected ethnographic material ed in Unequal Childhoods. First, I argue that concerted cultivation is a racialized  practice and that families negotiate and navigate a complex race- and-class-based social context of rearing. Second, I  a re-reading of excerpts from Unequal Childhoods to show how families of color, and in particular Black families, cultivate racial knowledge and skills in their . Third, I make a case for the larger sociological usefulness of a layered race and class analysis of  culture, and argue that such a framework adds more depth to core arguments made by Lareau. In the last section, I discuss the social tensions that exist within concerted cultivation and intensive  culture. I reflect on possible implications for normative  culture that matches well with neoliberal market rationality, exists within racial capitalism, but at the same time connects to anti-racist socialization and rejection of hegemonic cultural ideologies."
Love and control: Self-criticism in parents and daughters and perceptions of relationship partners,2008,"The role of self-criticism in  behaviors and the impact of these behaviors on daughters' own levels of self-criticism, depression, and perceptions of romantic partners were investigated. s provided information on their levels of self-criticism (DEQ; Blatt, D'Afflitti, & Quinlan, 1976) and   (SASB; Benjamin, 1974). Their daughters completed questionnaires assessing their level of self-criticism, depression (BDI-II; Beck, 1996), and the interpersonal  of their boyfriends. Structural equation modeling indicated self-critical mothers and fathers reported being less loving and more controlling with their daughters, which predicted self-criticism in daughters. Self-criticism in daughters, in turn, was associated with increased depression and perceptions of boyfriends as being less loving and more controlling. These  support the concept of al influences on internal working models and their consequent impact on interpersonal functioning (Andrews, 1989; Benjamin, 1974). (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd."
Maternal Depression and Dyadic Interaction: The role of Maternal Attachment Style,2010,"Maternal mental health and the contents of her reational world are important determinants of early   relationship. We examined, first, the role of prenatal and postnatal depressive symptoms and maternal attachment  in predicting the quality of mother- interaction. Second, we analysed whether the secure-autonomous attachment  can protect the dyadic interaction from the negative effects of maternal depression. The participants were 59 mother-infant pairs examined during pregnancy (T1), 4-5 months postpartum (T2) and when the  were approximately 14 months old (T3). Maternal attachment  was assessed with a modified Adult Attachment Interview -procedure, depressive symptoms with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and observed mother- interaction with Care Index. The  show that autonomous mothers were more sensitive and responsive and their  more cooperative than dyads with dismissing maternal attachment . As hypothesized, mothers with the combination of both prenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms were highly unresponsive in their dyadic interaction. Further, prenatal depressive symptoms had a stronger impact on maternal unresponsiveness than postnatal symptoms. As hypothesized, mother's autonomous attachment  protected the mother- interaction from the negative impact of maternal postnatal depressive symptoms, whereas dyads with preoccupied mothers were especially at risk for interaction problems when mothers had postpartum depressive symptoms.

Individual Differences in Self-Compassion: The Role of Attachment and Experiences of Parenting in Childhood,2015,"Much evidence indicates that self-compassion is related to a wide range of positive outcomes, yet remarkably little is known as to the origins of self-compassion. Here we  two studies that investigate the potential origins of individual differences in self-compassion. In Study 1, participants' (N=329) recall of high al rejection and overprotection, and low al warmth in hood predicted low self-compassion, and this was mediated by attachment anxiety. Attachment avoidance did not mediate any association. Study 2 (N=32) extended this cross-sectional  by experimentally enhancing attachment security, which led to an increase in state self-compassion. Results suggest that early hood experiences and attachment may influence the development of self-compassion."
Once and Again,2019,"Animal and human studies suggest that   is transmitted from one generation to the next. The hypotheses of this  were that (1) a mother's rearing experiences (G1) would predict her own  resources (G2) and (2) current maternal mood, motivation to care for her offspring, and relationship with her s would underlie this association. In a subsample of 201 first-time mothers participating in the longitudinal Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment project, we assessed a mother's own hood maltreatment and rearing experiences (G1) using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and the al Bonding Instrument. At 6 months postpartum, mothers completed questionnaires on  stress (G2), symptoms of depression, maternal motivation, and current relationship with their own s. The sample consisted of mostly high socioeconomic status mothers recruited from Montreal (n=135) or Hamilton (n=66), Canada, with an age range from 18 to 43 years (M=29.41, SD=4.85 years). More severe maltreatment and less supportive rearing by the mother's s (G1) predicted increased  stress at 6 months (G2). These associations were mediated through distinct psychosocial pathways: maltreatment (G1) on  stress (G2) through symptoms of depression (Z=2.297; p=.022); maternal rearing (G1) on  stress (G2) through maternal motivation (Z=-2.155; p=.031) and symptoms of depression (Z=-1.842; p=.065); and paternal rearing (G1) on  stress (G2) through current relationship with the father (Z=-2.617; p=.009). Maternal rearing experiences predict a mother's own  resources though distinct psychosocial pathways, including depressed mood, maternal motivation, and social support."
"Parenting Adolescents in Times of a Pandemic: Changes in Relationship Quality, Autonomy Support, and Parental Control?",2021,"This Dutch multi-informant  examined effects of the first COVID-19 lockdown (LD; e.g., school closure and social restrictions) on -adolescent relationships. Four biweekly measurements before and 4 biweekly measurements during the LD were collected among adolescents (N = 179, M-age = 14.26 years, 69% girls) and their s (N = 144, M-age = 47.01 years, 81% female). s' educational level was relatively diverse: 12% low (high school or lower), 33% medium (vocational training), and 55% high (college or university). Adolescents and s reported on al support, -adolescent conflict, autonomy support, psychological control, behavioral control, and time spent on various activities. Adolescents spent more time with their s during LD (before M = 8.6 hr, during M = 12.7 hr), but less time with friends (before M = 8.1 hr, during M = 2.1 hr), and reported on average 13 COVID-19-related rules. Preregistered piecewise growth models confirmed that autonomy support decreased immediately during the LD, but no mean level changes were observed in the other relationship dimensions. During the first 2 months of the LD, s reported gradual increases in autonomy support and decreases in behavioral control. Moreover, significant differences between families were found in sudden and more gradual relationship changes, which correlated strongly with pre-LD characteristics of the relationship, and in some models with adolescent oppositional defiance and legitimacy beliefs. In sum, findings suggest resilience in most families, but  heterogeneity: Some families were negatively affected, and others were positively affected. A tailored approach is therefore needed to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on family functioning."
African American Mothers Talk to Their Preadolescents About Honesty and Lying,2021,"Objectives: While existing work points to the ways  behaviors and specific value socialization approaches influence 's internalization of moral values (Baumrind, Child Development 43, 261-267, 1972; Hoffman, Empathy and moral development: Implications for caring and justice, 2001; Grusec & Davidov, Child Development, 81, 687-709, 2010), little work has considered the experiences of African American and lower-income families. The current  capitalized on the availability of 53 video-recorded mother-preadolescent conversations about their disagreements from the Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Project (Vogel et al., Early head start  in grade 5: Long-term follow-up of the early head start  and evaluation  sample. OPRE Report # 2011-8, 2010). Methods: Using inductive analysis, we assessed mothers' affective tone, communication , and message content during the discussion of problems involving honesty and lying. Results: Mothers tended to display warm yet firm affect, incorporate both autonomy-supportive and dominant-directive communication , assert that lying is never acceptable, and explain why lying is problematic. Conclusions: Mothers' affect, communication , and message content reflected a no-nonsense approach to transmitting values about honesty to their .

"Maternal attachment style, sensitivity, and infant obesity risk in low-income, Latino families",2021,"Disparities in hood obesity highlight the need for  to identify its early predictors in high-risk populations, such as low-income, Latino families. In the current , the first of its kind in a low-income Latino sample (N = 55; M- age = 12.74 months, SD = 3.96), we investigated whether mothers' self-reported attachment  predicted their infants' weight-for-length (WFL; an early indicator of hood obesity). We  explored whether observed maternal sensitivity, coded from a video-recorded semi-structured play assessment, mediated this association. We found a significant direct effect of maternal attachment  on infants' WFL z-scores (c' = -0.68, SE = 0.22, p = .004). Infants of mothers who classified themselves as secure had lower WFL z-scores than infants of insecure mothers (avoidant or anxious). Maternal sensitivity did not mediate this association, but was positively associated with infant WFL z-scores. We discuss implications of these findings for future ."
"Emotional climate, feeding practices, and feeding styles: an observational analysis of the dinner meal in Head Start families",2011,"Background: A number of studies conducted with ethnically diverse, low-income samples have found that s with indulgent feeding  had  with a higher weight status. Indulgent s are those who are responsive to their 's emotional states but have problems setting appropriate boundaries with their . Because the processes through which  impact  weight are poorly understood, the aim of this  was to observe differences in the emotional climate created by s (including affect, tone of voice, and gestures) and behavioral feeding practices among those reporting different feeding  on the Caregiver's Feeding Styles Questionnaire. A secondary aim was to examine differences on  weight status across the feeding . Methods: Participants were 177 Head Start families from Houston, Texas (45% African-American; 55% Hispanic). Using an observational approach, the relationship between the observed emotional climate of the meal, behavioral feeding practices, and self-reported  feeding  were examined. Mean age of the  was 4.4 years (SD = 0.7) equally distributed across gender. Families were observed on 3 separate dinner occasions. Heights and weight were measured on the s and . Results: s with self-reported indulgent feeding  made fewer demands on their  to eat during dinner and showed lower levels of negative affect and intrusiveness. Surprisingly, these s  showed higher levels of emotional detachment with their  during dinner. Hispanic boys with indulgent s had significantly higher BMI z scores compared to Hispanic boys in the other three feeding  groups. No other differences were found on  weight status. Conclusions: Results suggest that the emotional climate created by indulgent s during dinner and their lack of demands on their  to eat may play an important role in how young  become overweight. Numerous observed emotional climate and behavioral differences were found between the other self-reported feeding  as well. Results suggest that s' self-reported feeding  may be a proxy for the emotional climate of the dinner meal, which may in turn influence the 's eating behaviors and weight status."
"Intergenerational differences in acculturation experiences, food beliefs and perceived health risks among refugees from the Horn of Africa in Melbourne, Australia",2015,"Objective: To investigate the differences in acculturation experiences between  and adolescent refugees from the Horn of Africa in Melbourne, Australia and to explore food beliefs and perceived health risks from an intergenerational perspective. Design: Qualitative cross-sectional  involving a combination of semi-structured one-on-one interviews and focus group discussions. Setting: North-West suburbs of Melbourne, Australia. Subjects: Eritrean, Ethiopian, Somali and Sudanese refugees. Results: Using a purposeful sampling technique, twelve semi-structured face-to-face interviews (nine adults and three adolescents) and four in-depth focus groups (two with adolescents each containing six participants and two with adults one containing six participants and the other ten participants) were carried out. Thus overall data were obtained on fifteen adolescents and twenty-five s. Qualitative analysis identified differences between s and adolescents in relation to life, diet and physical activity. Views regarding health consequences of their changed diets  differed. al feeding practices encompassed a variety of methods and were enforced in an attempt by s to control their 's dietary behaviours and prevent their drift away from traditional eating habits. Conclusions: These findings call for more  to contextualise dietary acculturation among refugee youth and the impact of migration on   and feeding practices in communities from the Horn of Africa. Preventive health programmes with Horn of Africa refugees need to acknowledge the effect of acculturation on diet and physical activity levels and a socio-cultural framework needs to be developed with respect to the importance and influence of the family environment."
The Role of Family in Bullying and Cyberbullying Involvement: Examining a New Typology of Parental Education Management Based on Adolescents' View of Their Parents,2019,"The influence of the family in 's involvement in bullying and cyberbullying has been well documented. However, previous  into this relationship seems to have overlooked recent social changes, which have affected the family context. The aim of this  is to put forward a categorization of the current educational management of Spanish s and examine how this is linked to their 's involvement in bullying and cyberbullying. To achieve this, 2060 school from the South of Spain (47.9% girls with mean age = 14.34) answered four questionnaires including the Scale for the Assessment of the  Styles of Adolescents' Mothers and Fathers, the Discipline Dimensions Inventory, the European Bullying Intervention Project Questionnaire, and the European Cyberbullying Intervention Project Questionnaire. The Cluster Analysis  revealed a typology containing six : permissive, authoritarian, strict, normative democratic, indulgent democratic, and punitive democratic. Lower levels of victimization and aggression in bullying and cyberbullying were found to be linked to the indulgent democratic or normative democratic  and higher levels to the authoritarian and strict . The value of s' educational practices and how they are combined in general , since these are elements that can predispose or prevent adolescent's involvement in bullying and cyberbullying, is discussed."
Predicting the -rearing practices of mothers sexually abused in hood,2001,"Objective: Although empirical investigations have established a relationship between hood sexual abuse and numerous long-term consequences, surprisingly little  has addressed the possible effects of hood victimization on the later -rearing practices of adult survivors. The   examined hypothesized predictors of three   among adult survivors of sexual abuse as compared with adult  of alcoholic s. Method: Forty-five clinical outpatients completed a questionnaire battery assessing experiences of hood abuse, current economic and social resources, and  attitudes and practices. The -rearing practices of participants were compared with those reported by a community sample of 717 mothers. Additional analyses examined the extent to which sexual abuse and its adult sequelae predicted the  behaviors reported by the  sample. Results: Both sexual abuse survivors and  of alcoholics reported significantly higher rates of permissive  practices than mothers in the community sample. Multiple regression analyses further revealed unique relationships between sexual abuse and , over and above the variance explained by physical abuse, current socioeconomic status, and the experience of growing up in an alcoholic home. Mothers' sexual abuse severity, social support satisfaction, and dysfunctional  attitudes moderated several of these relationships. Conclusions: The  findings suggest that sexual abuse and its adult sequelae may have negative consequences for the  practices of survivors, particularly for survivors' ability to provide their  with appropriate structure, consistent discipline, and clear behavioral expectations. Implications for the psychosocial development of survivors'  are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."
Feminizing leadership in the Middle East Emirati women empowerment and leadership style,2017,"Purpose - This paper aims to form an empirical , stemming from a Middle-Eastern context, on eliminating gender discrimination and achieving women's empowerment. It aims to develop a conceptual model on the principal social and cultural factors inducing the success of Emirati women in attaining senior leadership roles and shaping their leadership  to be transformational. Moreover, it examines the comparability and divergence of the accumulated data on the empowerment of Emirati women in an international context from existing international literature. Design/methodology/approach - The design of the  was based on data gathered from face-to-face, semi-structured interviews with four Emirati women occupying the highest leadership positions in various fields, followed by thematic analysis. Findings - Data analysis confirmed the significant influence of the 's key factors, namely, the role of the national government, Islamic work ethic and family, on the subjects' empowerment and their adherence to transformational leadership . However, two new key factors impacting empowerment emerged, namely, the influence of rulers' leadership and the efforts in balancing work/life commitments. The findings led to the development of a  model on Emirati women empowerment and leadership , reflecting the appropriateness of international literature on the Emirati context. Particularly, it is the social and economic circumstances of the nation supported by policies form the major source of empowerment, in addition to the important role that family capital and business ethics play. Remarkably, the challenges facing Emirati working women ought to be different than the rest of the Middle East. Originality/value - A dearth of literature pertaining to women's leadership exists; however, they were mostly carried out within Western contexts that may not be applicable to Arab societies because of cultural and religious differences. The  strives to portray an unambiguous picture to the significant impact of the  role and Islam work ethics in relating positively to their daughters and prompt them to develop crucial societal and professional skills, in a country as UAE where expatriates and Westerns dominate the population body. In addition, it shapes the UAE national government as a unique example and role model, to local governments in other Arab states, to learn from regarding supporting women, helping them to achieve excellence. Aiming for feminizing leadership, the Emirati women leadership  are explored in an attempt to demonstrate the capacities and potentials of Emirati and Arab women in positions of power and influence. It is assumed that this  will help in bringing confidence in Emirati women capabilities, inducing a change in attitudes towards Arab women managers and encouraging employment in non-traditional feminine based jobs."
Internalizing Behavior in Adolescent Girls Affects Parental Emotional Overinvolvement: A Cross-lagged Twin Study,2011,"The aim of this  was to examine the direction and the etiology of the association between different   (al emotional overinvolvement [EOI] and al criticism) and internalizing behavior from adolescence to early adulthood. A longitudinal genetically informative cross-lagged design was applied to a population-based sample of Swedish twins contacted at age 16-17 (n = 2369) and at age 19-20 (n = 1705). Sex-limitation modelling revealed different effects for boys and girls. For girls, genetic influences on internalizing problems at age 16-17 independently explained 2.7% of the heritability in al EOI at age 19-20. These  suggest that emotionally overinvolved and self-sacrificing al behavior stems in part from daughters (but not sons) genetic predisposition for internalizing behavior. These findings highlight the importance of genetically influenced -driven effects underlying the -internalizing association, and clarify that the role of such effects may differ depending on sex, type of  and developmental period."
The Inventory of Father Involvement-Short Form Among Portuguese Fathers: Psychometric Properties and Contribution to Father Involvement Measurement,2017,"The aim of this  was to analyze the psychometric properties of the Portuguese version of the Inventory of Father Involvement-Short Form (IFI-SF) with respect to its factor structure, reliability, and preliminary concurrent and discriminant validity (Study 1), and to confirm the factor structure in a different sample (Study 2). In Study 1, 380 men (M = 42.2, SD = 6.8) completed the IFI-SF translated version, and a subgroup of 92 men  completed the Portuguese versions of the  Stress Index-Short Form, the  Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire-Short Form, and the Paternal Involvement Scale. In Study 2, 220 men (M = 43.1, SD = 6.1) completed the IFI-SF translated version. The  of confirmatory factor analyses (Study 1) found that the Portuguese IFI-SF had a bifactor structure, dissimilar to that of the original version. More specifically, a model depicting a general factor and 9 first-order factors was confirmed, with omega hierarchical coefficients indicating that only an IFI-SF global score should be calculated/interpreted. This structure was confirmed in Study 2. Cronbach's alpha reliabilities in Study 1 and 2 were .93 and .95 for the global scale, respectively. Moreover, there was preliminary evidence of the scale's concurrent and discriminant validity. These  indicate that the measure is suitable for use in the Portuguese context with an interpretable global score, and may be a useful tool for  regarding the positive aspects of men's al involvement, as such information may  be relevant in cross-cultural studies."
Parental Overprotection and Sleep Problems in Young Children,,"Poor sleep in  predicts mental and physical disorders later in life. Identifying and changing modifiable factors associated with sleep problems in young  may improve their health trajectory. Our aim was to establish whether overprotective  was associated with problems sleeping in . s of  aged 2-6 years completed questionnaires about their own anxiety,  , and about their 's sleep. We obtained 307 reports on 197  from 240 s. Using mixed-effects linear regression, we found that maternal (beta = 0.26, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.41, p = 0.001) and paternal (beta = 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.53, p < 0.001) overprotection were associated with impaired sleep in . This relationship remained unchanged when controlling for al anxiety. Decreasing s' overprotection may improve 's sleep, and reduce the risk of physical and mental disorders later in their life."
Paternal malparenting and offspring personality disorders: Mediating effect of early maladaptive schemas,2017,"Objective: To examine the mediating role of maladaptive schemas between permissive/authoritarian  by fathers and personality disorders, including histrionic, antisocial, narcissistic and depressive attitudes among adults. Methods: This cross-sectional  was conducted at the University of Sargodha, Sargodha, Pakistan, and comprised university students. Data was collected by administering the al authority questionnaire, the young schema questionnaire and the personality diagnostic questionnaire. SPSS 23 was used for data analysis. The  was completed in one year. It was started from June 2014 and ended in June 2015. Results: Of the 200 participants who were handed the questionnaires, 100(50%) returned it fully filled up. Of them, 87(87%) were women and 13(13%) were men. All scales had greater than 0.70 alpha reliability coefficients. The values of skewness for all scales ranged from 0.10 to 0.86. Permissive   had positive correlation with histrionic (p< 0.05), narcissistic (p< 0.05) and antisocial personality disorders (p< 0.01). Authoritarian  had positive correlation with early maladaptive schemas (p< 0.01) and depressive personality disorder (p< 0.05). Conclusion: Both permissive and authoritarian   led to personality disorders among offspring in the adult phase of their lives."
"Parenting Behaviors, Adolescent Depressive Symptoms, and Problem Behavior: The Role of Self-Esteem and School Adjustment Difficulties Among Chinese Adolescents",2016,Cross-sectional data from 589 Chinese adolescents were used to investigate whether  behaviors are directly or indirectly (through self-esteem and school adjustment difficulties) associated with adolescent depressive symptoms and problem behavior. Structural equation modeling  showed that school adjustment difficulties fully mediated the relations between two  behaviors (al punitiveness and paternal monitoring) and adolescent problem behavior and partially mediated the relation between maternal monitoring and adolescent problem behavior. Adolescent self-esteem partially mediated the relations between maternal punitiveness and adolescent depressive symptoms and fully mediated the relations between al support and adolescent depressive symptoms. al love withdrawal was not significantly related to any adolescent adjustment when other  practices were controlled. The findings highlight the interactions between family and school contexts in adolescent development.
Parentality and resilience in adoption,2010,"In this article, we  the first  of our  that links the variables hood and resilience in the case of internationally adopted  and their families. We define the resilient characteristics of these  and how to promote them, emphasising the role of the family as a promoter of resilience. Considering the scarce previous literature relating these three variables, this  is necessarily exploratory. We worked with a sample of n=9, with the administration of the Educational Style Profile (ESP) for s (Magaz & Garcia, 1998) to assess  , and the Resilience Inventory for Children (Salgado, 2005a), validated in Peruvian , to assess resilience. Results show a significant correlation between the mother's inhibited educational  and the father's punitive educational , and  with the father's assertive . For this reason, we want to see the repercussion of these educational  on the 's resilience and verify the usefulness of an instrument to assess resilience. From this, we are currently validating this instrument in Spanish population, with the aim of using it both in  and in the clinical field."
The origins of individual differences in dispositional mindfulness,2016,"A large and coherent body of evidence reveals that high dispositional mindfulness is a positive personal resource, yet remarkably little is known about the origins of individual differences in mindfulness. Attachment theory describes how early experiences with caregivers shape psychosocial development across the lifespan. Drawing from attachment theory, we propose that those who have received sensitive and responsive caregiving in hood are more likely to have a secure attachment  which may, in turn, provide greater capacity for mindfulness. In an adolescent sample attending a large urban university (Study 1), there were indirect effects of al rejection and al warmth on mindfulness via attachment anxiety and avoidance. In Study 2 we tested the same hypotheses in a group of adolescent high school students and replicated the above pattern of . In brief, both retrospective reports (Study 1) and current reports (Study 2) of the quality of  received were associated with individual differences in mindfulness via attachment processes. This  suggests that the origins of individual differences in dispositional mindfulness may have their roots in early hood experiences. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Maternal mind-mindedness during infancy, general parenting sensitivity and observed  feeding behavior: a longitudinal study",2014,"Maternal mind-mindedness, or the tendency to view the  as a mental agent, has been shown to predict sensitive and responsive  behavior. As yet the role of mind-mindedness has not been explored in the context of feeding interactions. This  evaluates the relations between maternal mind-mindedness at 6 months of infant age and subsequently observed maternal sensitivity and feeding behaviors with  at age 1year. Maternal mind-mindedness was greater in mothers who had breast-fed compared to formula-fed. Controlling for breast-feeding, mind-mindedness at 6months was correlated with observations of more sensitive and positive feeding behaviors at 1year of age. Mind-mindedness was  associated with greater general maternal sensitivity in play and this general  sensitivity mediated the effect of mind-mindedness on more sensitive and positive feeding behaviors. Interventions to promote maternal tendency to consider their 's mental states may encourage more adaptive al feeding behaviors."
Differential parenting and sibling jealousy: Developmental correlates of young adults' romantic relationships,2007,"Data from a survey of 200 young adults assessed whether the early nonshared environment, specifically al differential treatment, was associated with romantic relationship distress through its effects on sibling jealousy, attachment , and self-esteem. Individuals who received equal affection from their s in comparison to their sibling reported equal jealousy between themselves and their sibling, had higher self-esteem, more secure attachment , and less romantic relationship distress. Receiving differential al affection, regardless of whether the participant or their sibling was favored, was associated with more negative models of self and others, which in turn were associated with greater romantic relationship distress. Results indicate that early within-family experiences may be particularly relevant for later healthy romantic relationship functioning."
Autonomy- vs. connectedness-oriented parenting behaviours in Chinese and Canadian mothers,2005,"The purpose of the  was to investigate maternal socialization goal-oriented behaviours in Chinese and Canadian mothers. Participants were samples of  at 2 years of age and their mothers in P. R. China and Canada. Data on  autonomy and connectedness and maternal encouragement of autonomy and connectedness were collected from observations of mother- interactions in a laboratory situation. Cross-cultural similarities as well as differences were found in the . Chinese mothers had higher scores on overall involvement than Canadian mothers during mother- interaction. When overall involvement was controlled, Chinese mothers had higher scores than Canadian mothers on encouragement of connectedness. In contrast, Canadian mothers had higher scores than Chinese mothers on encouragement of autonomy. The  suggest that culturally general and specific socialization goals and values are reflected in maternal  behaviours."
Influence of Parenting Quality and Neuroticism on Perceived Job Stressors and Psychological and Physical Stress Response in Adult Workers from the Community,2020,"Background: The complex interaction between  , job stressors, and the stress response has not been clarified to date. We hypothesized that neuroticism acts as a mediator in the effects of  quality on perceived job stressors and the psychological and physical stress response (PPSR), and tested this hypothesis using covariance structure analysis. Subjects and Methods: We conducted  between April 2017 and April 2018 on 597 adult from the community, and 69 subjects were excluded owing to missing data or nonworkers. Finally, a total of 528 participants were analyzed using the following self-administered questionnaires: the al Bonding Instrument, the shortened Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised, and the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire (BJSQ). The data were analyzed by single regression analyses and covariance structure analyses. Job stress was assessed by the BJSQ and 2 subscales, ie, perceived job stressors and the PPSR. This  was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tokyo Medical University. Results: On covariance structure analysis, high al overprotection was associated with high neuroticism and high PPSR directly, but had no significant effect on perceived job stressors. High al overprotection was associated with high-perceived job stressors and the high PPSR indirectly through enhanced neuroticism. High al overprotection was  associated with the high PPSR indirectly through 2 combined paths of neuroticism and perceived job stressors. This model accounted for 40% of the variability of the PPSR. On the other hand, al care had opposite effects to al overprotection, and this model of al care accounted for 39% of the variability of PPSR. The model fits of the 2 models were good. Conclusion: Our  suggest that the quality of  in hood is associated with perceived job stressors and the PPSR indirectly through neuroticism."
Attachment and attitudes toward : effects of security priming in parents and non-parents,,"The  two- investigation is the first to examine whether experimentally boosting attachment security (security priming) affects attitudes in the  domain for both s and non-s. Mothers (n = 72) and less undergraduates (n = 82) were randomly assigned to a neutral or a secure prime condition and then completed measures of implicit attitudes (a -focused version of the Go/No-Go Association Task) and explicit attitudes (self-reported) toward . Following the priming manipulation, mothers in the secure prime condition had more positive implicit attitudes toward their  compared to mothers in the neutral prime condition. Security priming  increased mothers' positive explicit attitudes toward their , but only among mothers who scored high on self-reported attachment-related avoidance. No priming effects emerged among non-s. These  provide the first evidence for a causal link between al attachment security and al attitudes toward ."
Value Added: Digital Modeling of Dialogic Questioning Promotes Positive Parenting During Shared Reading,,"American s describe bonding with their  as a primary reason for engaging in shared picture book reading. One prominent reading intervention (dialogic reading) reliably increases language outcomes, but until recently, has not been evaluated for how well it promotes warm - interactions. In this , a digital application designed to promote - conversation by modeling dialogic questioning  increased mutuality, positivity, and on-task behaviors. Three- and 4-year-old American  (n = 73) and their s were randomly assigned to read 10 times at home either: (a) an eBook with a character who modeled dialogic questioning (experimental); (b) a version of the same eBook without modeling (control); or (c) to choose between versions for each reading (choice). An adaption of the PARCHISY coding scheme was used to evaluate , , and dyadic behaviors during in-lab readings at the beginning and end of the 2-week home reading period. At the final visit, experimental group families showed significant growth in mutuality (i.e., responsiveness, reciprocity, and cooperation), on-task behaviors, and  and  positivity, and displayed more of these behaviors than families not exposed to modeling. Some increases in mutuality and positivity  emerged in families in the choice condition, but fewer than in families who only read the eBook with modeling. s and  exhibited no significant changes in negativity in any condition. This  suggests that carefully designed digital technology has the potential to foster positive shared reading interactions between s and young ."
Mindfulness Training for Children with ADHD and Their Parents: A Randomized Control Trial,2022,"Objective: The aim of this randomized control trial is to analyze the efficacy of a Mindfulness-based program (MYmind) in improving ADHD symptoms, associated problems, executive functions, and family functioning.

Links between socialization goals and -rearing practices in Chinese and Indian mothers,2003,"Mothers of preschoolers in China and India reported on the value they accorded to items tapping two socialization goals, Filial Piety and Socioemotional Development and two  , Authoritative and Authoritarian. In both cultures, maternal valuing of Filial Piety was associated with greater exertion of al control, whereas greater valuing of Socioemotional Development was related to more frequent use of Authoritative practices. However, patterns in relationships between Filial Piety, Socioemotional Development and Authoritative  differed across Chinese and Indian mothers. Positive associations were found among these three variables for Indian mothers, reflecting Hindu beliefs about young  and hood. Among Chinese mothers, on the other hand, Filial Piety was negatively related with Socioemotional Development and the use of Authoritative practices. Our  suggest that Chinese mothers believe that the use of authoritative practices, which encourage socioemotional development in , will inhibit achievement of filial behaviour and academic achievement. Contrasts between these two Asian cultures highlight the importance of considering s' socialization goals and beliefs in cross-cultural studies of -rearing practices.

The Role of Family and School in Securing Psychological Well-Being of Primary School Children,2019,"The paper reviews the age spicific form of psychological well-being in primary school age as the  of the acquisition of a new social position and role of student that, according to C.Ryff, is the essence of psychological adaptation of the  to school. The  was aimed at exploring the conditions of psychological adaptation to school in chidlren as a process that promotes psychological well-being at this age. The  goals were as follows: to explore the character and dynamics of school adaptation in first-graders; to compare the notions of successful adaptation in teachers and s; to  the relationship between successful psychological adaptation to school and a) the features of the internal position of student, b) the type of  . The sample consisted of 122 first-graders (7-8 years old) and 110 s. It was empirically proven that all components of psychological well-being in primary school , namely: positive relations in the form of cooperation in joint educational activities with the teacher and peers; self-acceptance reed in the form of internal position of student as self-identification with the social role of the student; competence as mastering the means of learning activity and autonomy as an independent implementation of the latter; important goals in the form of meaningful acceptance of learning objectives; personal growth, expressed in the content and pace of individual progress in personal and metacognitive development - all these are determined by the psychological readiness of teachers and s to transform their relationships with the  and to establish adequate forms of educational cooperation.

Family Management Style Improves Family Quality of Life in Children With Epilepsy: A Randomized Controlled Trial,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Epilepsy is a common chronic disease with transient brain dysfunction and critically influences the quality of patients' family life. The aim of this  was to analyze the effectiveness of family management  on family quality of life in . METHODS: We randomized 130  to either the intervention group (n = 65) or the control group (n = 65). Family management  combined with routine care was applied in the intervention group within the first 24 hours after admission, whereas only routine care was applied in the control group. Family management  contains 3 steps: involve families into the intervention group and determine treatment plan, educate s on how to manage their family, and monitor quality of home management. Scores on the Beach Center Family Quality of Life Scale (FQOL) of 2 groups were collected at 3 time points: within the first 24 hours after admission (T1), 6 months after discharge (T2), and 12 months after discharge (T3). Repeated-measures analysis of variance of FQOL scores was used to evaluate difference. RESULTS: Full scores and each subscale's scores on FQOL in the control group and the intervention group at T1 had no statistical significance (P > .05). Scores on FQOL at T2 and T3 increased in the intervention group, but there was almost no change in the control group, with statistical significance between the intervention group and the control group (P < .05). Scores on FQOL at T1, T2, and T3 showed that score of subscale except  FQOL improved in the intervention group (P < .05), but no difference was shown in the control group (P > .05). There was no difference shown among the control group and the intervention group that interacted with time (P > .05). CONCLUSION: The family management  can effectively improve the family quality of life in  with epilepsy, especially at the satisfaction level of family emotional well-being and disability-related support."
THE RELATIONSHIP OF MATERNAL EMPLOYMENT TO PARENTING STYLE AND ATTITUDES: PARENTS FROM SINGLE AND TWO PAYCHECK FAMILIES,2009,
Overparenting and Narcissism in Young Adults: The Mediating Role of Psychological Control,2018,"Over, or helicopter , can be generally characterized as  that is well-intentioned, but over-involved and intrusive. This  of  has been especially highlighted in the lives of young adults, who may be inhibited by this form of  in the appropriate development of autonomy and independence. Over shares conceptual similarities with s' psychological control practices, which involve emotional and psychological manipulation of  (e.g., inducing guilt, withholding love as a form of control). Although these constructs contain key differences, both have been linked to narcissism in young adults, by way of al over-involvement in 's lives. Thus, we sought to explore al psychological control as a mediator between over and narcissism, including in regard to both grandiose and vulnerable narcissistic phenotypes. Participants included 380 young adult college students (age range: 18-26 years) who completed the Pathological Narcissism Inventory, as well as reports of their s' behaviors related to over and psychological control. Mediation analyses through Process in SPSS supported the hypothesized role of al psychological control as a mediator between over and narcissistic traits, including traits related to both grandiose and vulnerable narcissism. Effect sizes for each analysis were modest. This  further clarifies the nature of over, and speaks to the need for further  in establishing the mechanisms by which over may lead to narcissistic traits among young adults."
"Mothers' Power Assertion; Children's Negative, Adversarial Orientation; and Future Behavior Problems in Low-Income Families: Early Maternal Responsiveness as a Moderator of the Developmental Cascade",2015,"al power assertion, a key dimension of family environment, generally sets in motion detrimental developmental cascades; however, evidence suggests that other qualities of , such as responsiveness, can significantly moderate those processes. Mechanisms that account for such moderating effects are not fully understood. We propose a conceptual model of processes linking al power assertion, al responsiveness, 's negative, adversarial, rejecting orientation toward the , and behavior problems. We test that model in a short-term longitudinal design involving 186 low-income, ethnically diverse mothers and their toddlers. When  were 30 months, the dyads were observed in multiple, lengthy, naturalistic laboratory interactions to assess behaviorally mothers' responsiveness and their power-assertive control . At 33 months, we observed behavioral indicators of 's negative, adversarial, rejecting orientation toward the mothers in several naturalistic and standardized paradigms. At 40 months, mothers rated 's behavior problems. The proposed moderated mediation sequence, tested using a new approach, PROCESS (Hayes, 2013), was supported. The indirect effect from maternal power assertion to 's negative, adversarial orientation to future behavior problems was  when mothers' responsiveness was either low or average but absent when mothers were highly responsive. This  elucidates a potential process that may link al power assertion with behavior problems and highlights how positive aspects of  can moderate this process and defuse maladaptive developmental cascades. It  suggests possible targets for  intervention and prevention efforts."
Parenting and person correlates of prosocial behaviors in Asian Indian young adults,,"The primary goal of this  was to examine the intervening roles of prosocial moral reasoning and respect for family in associations between  attachment and prosocial behaviors in Asian Indian young adults. Participants included 281 Asian Indian young adults (60.5% women; M age = 21.45 years). Path analyses suggested that  attachment was positively associated with respect for family and prosocial moral reasoning. In turn, respect for family was positively associated with emotional, compliant, dire, and anonymous prosocial behaviors, while prosocial moral reasoning was positively associated with altruistic and negatively associated with public prosocial behaviors. Discussion focuses on the importance of both general and culture-specific mechanisms in explaining links between  and prosocial behaviors in Asian Indian young adults."
THE ROLE OF THE FAMILY IN AUTISTIC SPECTRUM CONDITIONS: THEORY AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS,2009,"The role of the family in Autistic Spectrum Conditions (ASC) has a controversial history, but current  has identified a number of key relationships between the behaviors of the  with ASC and  stress and . The current review highlights a number of relationships between  stress,  behaviors, and  behavior problems in ASC samples, and identifies areas where current  is lacking. In particular, the following concerns need to be addressed: whether high  stress levels impact negatively on  outcomes following interventions for ASC; the nature of the relationship between  stress and  behavior problems over time; whether  stress impacts on  behaviors, and the types of  behaviors that are influential for subsequent  behavior problems in the context of ASC; whether any association between  behaviors and  behavior problems is a direct one; and whether the contact and communication experiences of s with professionals leading up to, and during, the diagnostic process is of particular significance. The  of such examinations may well have practical implications for the development of future interventions for ASC."
Do parental attributions affect treatment outcome in a parenting program? An exploration of the effects of parental attributions in an RCT of Stepping Stones Triple P for the ASD population,2009,This  was conducted in conjunction with a randomised controlled trial of the  program Stepping Stones Triple P for s of  with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Fifty-nine families with a  with ASD participated. This  focussed upon the role of al attributions in predicting treatment outcome. Stepping Stones altered al attributions such that following participation in Stepping Stones s were significantly less likely to believe that their 's misbehaviour was Caused by factors intrinsic to their  and more likely to believe that their 's ASD-related behaviour may change in the future. al attributions before the intervention significantly predicted change in the dysfunctional   over-reactivity and verbosity throughout the intervention. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of developing a model for the role of al attributions in predicting treatment outcome. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
EARLY MOTHER-CHILD BONDING FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH CHILDREN OBESITY,2015,"The aim of this  is to describe the experience of a group of mothers with obese , regarding how early bond affects the relationship that both have with food and this, in turn, impacts on hood obesity. The   has a qualitative, exploratory and descriptive design. The sample consists of five chilean women between 22 and 39 years old, with obese  between 2 and 4 years old. In-depth interviews were carried out and open coding strategy was used as method of analysis. Results show a tendency of mothers to establish insecure attachment relations, difficulties of tuning and expression of affection, and a predominance of a permissive   around food. This has important implications for prevention and treatment of obesity, focusing on the attachment bond between mother and ."
Cross-Cultural Adaptation of the Brazilian Portuguese Version of the Caregiver's Feeding Styles Questionnaire,2020,"The   describes the cross-cultural adaptation of the Brazilian version (Rio de Janeiro) of the Caregiver's Feeding Styles Questionnaire (CFSQ) among caregivers of  aged 3 to 6 years enrolled in a family health service in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The cross-cultural adaptation process included the following phases: (1) literature review; (2) translation and back-translation of the instrument; (3) assessment of semantic equivalence through cognitive interviews with caregivers; (4) discussion with experts; (5) pretesting of the revised version; and (6) assessment of psychometric characteristics, including reliability and validity of the scale. Results showed the appropriateness of the caregiver's feeding  concept within the Brazilian culture and that the instrument was understandable to caregivers enrolled in a family health service. The CFSQ measurements showed perfect intra-observer reliability for demandingness and almost perfect for responsiveness. Inter-observer reliability was almost perfect for both dimensions, demandingness and responsiveness. Factor analysis of the Brazilian CFSQ version proposed an instrument with one dimension and 13 items. The satisfactory  of the cross-cultural adaptation of the CFSQ suggest its applicability in the population of interest with the possible reduction of some scale items."
The Family-Couple-Parenting Questionnaire: Development of a Measure for Long-Term Couples and Young Adults,2016,"This work describes the construction of family-couple- (FCP) question-naire, a new measure of three aspects related to the developmental path toward  choices, within the perspective of the family life cycle and attachment theory. Two studies are reported. Study I reports the development of the FCP questionnaire and its psychometric properties. Study 2 assesses the FCP's nomological validity by investigating group differences on FCP factors and links between FCP factors and romantic attachment (experience in close relationships revised) and recalled al bonding (al bonding instrument). Participants were 791 Italian participants: 405 young adults (203 students, 202 workers) and 193 couples (91 less-by-choice, 102 s-to-be). The  suggest that the FCP's stable psychometric structure and strong theoretical basis make FCP a useful instrument for  related to the path to hood."
"Paternal Self-efficacy, Fathering, and Children's Behavioral Problems in Korea",2019,"ObjectivesWith the introduction of co-, Korean society has begun demanding that fathers share -rearing responsibilities. In the  , we examined the association between fathers'  self-efficacy and 's behavioral problems via fathers'  behavior, after controlling for mothers'  self-efficacy, to clearly identify the importance of fathers in  rearing.MethodWe analyzed data from 1,463  and their fathers, which were available from the 2014 Panel Study on Korean Children, by employing structural equation modeling.ResultsThe  were as follows. First, the  revealed that there was a significant association between fathers with  self-efficacy and both warm and positive controlling al behaviors. Second, warm al behavior was significantly associated with both internalizing and externalizing problems, while fathers' positive controlling behavior was not linked to 's behavioral problems. Third, fathers'  self-efficacy had significant indirect effects on both internalizing and externalizing problems via warm al behavior.ConclusionsThese findings imply the importance of the role of fathers in the family, father- relationships for  development, and fathers'  self-efficacy in  rearing."
How Do Mothers and Fathers Influence Pediatric Injury Risk in Middle Childhood?,2010,"Objectives al influences are among the strongest behavioral correlates to unintentional injury outcome in early hood, but are less well understood as  develop. We implemented a prospective  design to  how  , - relationships, and al mental health influence injury during middle hood. We  considered the roles of  and  gender. Methods al influences were assessed from a sample of 584 first graders, plus their mothers and fathers. Injuries requiring medical treatment were assessed regularly over the subsequent 5 years. Logistic regression models examined how maternal and paternal  factors predicted injury among all , just boys, and just girls. Results Fathers who reported more positive relationships with their  had  protected from injury. This was particularly true of father-son relationships. No maternal traits predicted injury. Conclusions A positive father-, and especially a positive father-son relationship, may protect  from injury during middle hood."
"Perceived parenting styles and tobacco, alcohol and cannabis use among french adolescents: Gender and family structure differentials",2008,"Aims: To assess associations between al control or al emotional support and current tobacco, alcohol or cannabis use among 12-18-year-old students, according to gender and family structure (intact family, reconstituted family, single- family). Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in a national reative sample in France (2003) of 6-12th grade students (N = 16 532), as a part of the ESPAD  (European Study Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs). The self-administered questionnaire included questions on last 30 days' consumption of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis as well as on socio-demographic characteristics, school characteristics, and some simple questions on al control and al emotional support. Logistic modelling was carried out and (adjusted Odds Ratio) Ora calculated, adjusted for age, al educational and characteristics of the school. Results: A negative relationship exists between al control and substance use, but this relationship is more marked for tobacco (OR a between 1.8 and 5.6 according to level of control, family status and gender) and cannabis (OR between 1.5 and 6.4) than for alcohol (OR a between 1.0 and 2.7). al control is more markedly related to substance use in girls than in boys. These tendencies were observed for intact families as well as for single- families or reconstituted families. al control has a greater impact than emotional support. Among girls, emotional support has a greater impact than among boys. Conclusions: There is a gradient relationship between al control and current consumption, especially among girls. Thus, there may be a need for al control, whatever the family structure."
Motherhood and Maternal Fitness of Mothers Whose Parental Rights Were Terminated in Israel: The Importance of Sexual Heteronormality and Legitimacy,2021,"Motherhood res a social construct that is given meaning within patriarchal systems of law and custom. The   analyzes the Israeli legal discourse surrounding motherhood,  capacity, and sexual conduct of marginalized women whose al rights were terminated. It examines how information about a mother's sexual heteronormal life  played a role in the construction of her motherhood as maternal unfitness. Drawing from 80 court decisions terminating al rights, three themes emerged: the bad wife as a marker of the bad mother, legitimate sexual life as a pre-condition to desirable , and negative views of women who give birth out of marriage. Maternal unfitness was associated with sexual immorality, illegitimacy, and inappropriate sexual choices. Alternative explanations of the findings are discussed from a critical feminist and legal perspective. Implications of the findings are outlined, particularly the need for women's voices to be heard in every decision-making process regarding state control of their , and the need for professionals to avoid bias against socially marginalized women and engage in critical reflective thinking regarding why information about a mother's sexual conduct and life  is considered relevant to any assessment of her al fitness and the 's best interest."
"Protective self-presentation, sources of socialization, and loneliness among Australian adolescents and young adults",2007,"This  assessed the relative impact of features of protective self-ation, key sources of socialization, and social anxiety on individual differences in loneliness among Australian adolescents and young adults. In Study 1, 281 high school students living with s completed self-report measures of loneliness, self-ation features (i.e., fear of negative evaluation, social competence),   (overprotection, care), peer relations (attachment, teasing) and social anxiety. Peer and  measures were significant predictors of loneliness, independent of self ation influences. Social anxiety  added to the model after controlling for all other measures. In Study 2, 170 undergraduates living independently completed measures of the same constructs. Paralleling findings from Study 1, protective self-ation features, peer relations, and social anxiety had unique effects on loneliness. As hypothesized, however,  measures did not add to the prediction model for young adults. Implications of findings are discussed in relation to understanding loneliness within high school and university age samples. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Parental reactions to 's negative emotions: Relationships with emotion regulation in  with an anxiety disorder,2015,"Research has demonstrated that al reactions to 's emotions play a significant role in the development of 's emotion regulation (ER) and adjustment. This  compared  reactions to 's negative emotions between families of anxious and non-anxious  (aged 7-12) and examined associations between  reactions and 's ER. Results indicated that  diagnosed with an anxiety disorder had significantly greater difficulty regulating a range of negative emotions and were regarded as more emotionally negative and labile by their s. Results  suggested that mothers of anxious  espoused less supportive al emotional  when responding to their 's negative emotions. Supportive and non-supportive  reactions to 's negative emotions related to 's emotion regulation skills, with father's non-supportive  showing a unique relationship to 's negativity/lability.

Interventions to Reduce Behavioral Problems in Children With Cerebral Palsy: An RCT,2014,"OBJECTIVE:To test Stepping Stones Triple P (SSTP) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in a trial targeting behavioral problems in  with cerebral palsy (CP).METHODS:Sixty-seven s (97.0% mothers; mean age 38.7 7.1 years) of  (64.2% boys; mean age 5.3 3.0 years) with CP (Gross Motor Function Classification System = 15, 22%; II = 18, 27%; III =12, 18%; IV = 18, 27%; V = 4, 6%) participated and were randomly assigned to SSTP, SSTP + ACT, or waitlist. Primary outcomes were behavioral and emotional problems (Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory [ECBI], Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire [SDQ]) and   ( Scale [PS]) at postintervention and 6-month follow-up.RESULTS:SSTP with ACT was associated with decreased behavioral problems (ECBI Intensity mean difference [MD] = 24.12, confidence interval [CI] 10.22 to 38.03, P = .003; ECBI problem MD = 8.30, CI 4.63 to 11.97, P < .0001) including hyperactivity (SDQ MD = 1.66, CI 0.55 to 2.77, P = .004), as well as decreased al overreactivity (PS MD = 0.60, CI 0.16 to 1.04, P = .008) and verbosity (PS MD = 0.68, CI 0.17 to 1.20, P = .01). SSTP alone was associated with decreased behavioral problems (ECBI problems MD = 6.04, CI 2.20 to 9.89, P = .003) and emotional symptoms (SDQ MD = 1.33, CI 0.45 to 2.21, P = .004). Decreases in behavioral and emotional problems were maintained at follow-up.CONCLUSIONS:SSTP is an effective intervention for behavioral problems in  with CP. ACT delivers additive benefits."
A Multidimensional Model of Mothers' Perceptions of Parent Alcohol Socialization and Adolescent Alcohol Misuse,2016,"We assessed a multidimensional model of  alcohol socialization in which key socialization factors were considered simultaneously to identify combinations of factors that increase or decrease risk for development of adolescent alcohol misuse. Of interest was the interplay between putative risk and protective factors, such as whether the typically detrimental effects on youth drinking of  practices tolerant of some adolescent alcohol use are mitigated by an effective overall approach to  and al modeling of modest alcohol use. The sample included 1,530 adolescents and their mothers; adolescents' mean age was 13.0 (SD = .99) at the initial assessment. Latent profile analysis was conducted of mothers' reports of their attitude toward teen drinking, alcohol-specific  practices, al alcohol use and problem use, and overall approach to . The profiles were used to predict trajectories of adolescent alcohol misuse from early to middle adolescence. Four profiles were identified: 2 profiles reflected conservative alcohol-specific  practices and 2 reflected alcohol-tolerant practices, all in the context of other attributes. Alcohol misuse accelerated more rapidly from Grade 6 through 10 in the 2 alcohol-tolerant compared with conservative profiles. Results suggest that maternal tolerance of some youth alcohol use, even in the presence of dimensions of an effective   and low al alcohol use and problem use, is not an effective strategy for reducing risky adolescent alcohol use."
A mechanism for gratitude development in a ,2016,"Most scholars consider gratitude as a moral emotion, with only few seeing it as a character trait. As a , no systematic mechanism has ever been attempted to develop gratitude in . Given the social issue of widespread lack of gratitude in the one- generations of China, this article attempts to outline a mechanism of al moral education for gratitude development. The mechanism is underpinned by love, induction and discipline; and theoretically justified in accordance with key psychological and sociological theories, such as Piaget's theory of moral development, Kohlberg's moral stages theory, attachment theory, Hoffman's internalisation theory, Rest's social justice theory and Baumrind's   theory. The benefits and potential risks of each strategy of the mechanism are addressed."
The Material Context of Adolescent Identity Formation: A Family Economic Stress Approach,2021,"Grounded in the family stress model and recent studies on cognitive effects of poverty, the current  examines how family material conditions relate to identity-relevant information processing among adolescents via family economic strain, family financial conflicts, and  behaviors. Data for the  come from the first wave of a longitudinal  on the development of adolescent goals in the context of socio-economic inequalities. The sample includes 1,268 adolescents (51.7% females; M = 14.87; SD = 0.39) attending 36 gymnasiums. Findings reveal that the family economic situation contributes to how adolescents process identity-relevant information, but these effects are primarily indirect. Specifically, better family material conditions are associated with more supportive al engagement in their 's identity-relevant decisions, which in turn is associated with higher levels of the information-oriented identity processing . Poorer family material conditions, economic pressures, and conflicts are associated with al interference and a lack of engagement, which in turn is associated with higher levels of diffuse-avoidant identity . The identity  themselves are known predictors for a wide array of outcomes. Therefore, our findings suggest that countering the adverse effects of socio-economic inequality may be crucial to break a self-perpetuation cycle of socio-economic adversity."
Psychological distress: Testing hypotheses based on Roy's adaptation model,2003,"This  examined the relationships among social support,  stress, coping , and psychological distress in s caring for  with cancer The hypothesis that coping  plays a mediating role between social support and  stress, and psychological distress was tested for both mothers and fathers. In total, 246 mothers and 195 fathers of 270  participated in the . Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesis. The findings indicate that the hypotheses derived from the Roy adaptation model were supported for both mothers and fathers. A longitudinal  is suggested to examine the circular process of stimulus, coping process, and adaptation outcomes."
"ATTACHMENT STYLE, INTIMACY AND TRUST IN YOUNG ADULTHOOD - A REFLECTION OF PERCEIVED PARENTAL SENSITIVITY",1993,"Bowlby's hypothesis that emotional security and autonomy experienced in the early attachment relationship with s, are causally related to later relational competence, was explored. Seventy-six students (62 girls. 11 boys and 3 of unknown gender), aged between 18 and 23 years (Mean age = 19.5 years) completed the al Bonding Instrument (Parker, 1983), which was used to probe for perceived emotional warmth and autonomy support, or in short perceived al sensitivity, during hood and adolescence. Relational competence measures included the subscales ''trust'' and ''intimacy'' of the Erikson Psychosocial Stage Inventory (EPSI) (Rosenthal el al., 1981), the subscales ''friendship'' and ''dating'' of the Revised EPSI (McPhail Gray et al., 1986) and an adult attachment  measure (Hazan & Shaver, 1987). Eleven weeks after the first assessment, 45 subjects (42 girls and 3 boys) completed the same instruments for a second time. Concurrent and time-lagged relationships between perceived al sensitivity on the one hand and the relational variables on the other hand, were examined. Results indicated that perceived al sensitivity was positively associated with basic trust and the capacity for intimacy and for friendship, even when  characteristics and relational competence were assessed 11 weeks apart. For mother, the perceived emotional warmth seemed especially important. For father, the perceived autonomy support beared the strongest relationship with later relational competence. In this , al sensitivity was not significantly associated with the young adults' attachment , nor with their readiness for a one-to-one exclusive relationship (dating). Although conclusions about causal relations would be premature, the   certainly invites for further exploration of Bowlby's hypothesis."
"Differential roles of early maladaptive schema domains on the link between perceived parenting behaviors and depression, anxiety, and anger",2020,"Research that focuses on the association between  and psychological problems provide consistent  indicating more severe levels of maladjustment being associated with high levels of al rejection and control. Nevertheless, it is equally important to understand the mechanisms that explain the relationship among these concepts. The   explored the role of Early Maladaptive Schema (EMS) domains in the relationship between  dimensions (rejection and control) and measures of anxiety, depression, and maladaptive anger expression in a sample of Turkish undergraduate students (N = 266, 188 female). Participants were administered scales that assess maternal rejection and control, EMS, anxiety, depression, and anger. Results revealed that perceived maternal rejection and control in hood might have substantial influence in adult functioning. More specifically, the association between maternal rejection and psychological symptoms was mediated by disconnection schema domain. On the other hand, maternal control was linked to anxiety and depression through impaired autonomy schema domain, but its association with anger was through impaired limits schema domain. Findings indicate differential roles of schema domains on the relation between  behaviors and psychological distress measures."
Predictors of Immigrant Children's School Achievement: A Comparative Study,2009,"This paper examines the predictors and indicators of immigrant 's school achievement, using the two of the most predominant groups of American immigrants (103 Koreans and 100 Mexicans). Regression analyses were conducted to determine which independent variables (acculturation,  school involvement,  ,  education,  English, family income, length of stay in the United States) were the predictors of 's school achievement. For the total sample, an overall model of four predictors (acculturation,  ,  education, and length of stay in the United States) on school achievement was significant. While acculturation,  , and family income were significant predictors for the Korean sample,  education and length of stay in the United States were significant predictors for the Mexican sample. Practice implications and suggestions for the intervention were discussed based on the  findings."
Using a Behavioural Family Intervention to Produce a Three-Generational Benefit on Family Outcomes: A Case Report,2013,"Background: Grands have a significant role in providing regular  care to their grand. As such, they are in a unique position to help with the prevention of  disruptive disorders. However, the -care role grands provide can  negatively impact the grand- relationship. Aims: This case  examined the impact of a  program designed specifically for grands on a grand providing regular  care to her granddaughter. Method: A case  is ed of a 56-year-old grandmother providing between 31-40 hours of care per week to her granddaughter, who is at risk of developing an early onset  disruptive disorder. The grand was measured on outcomes of  behaviour;  ;  confidence; psychological wellbeing in terms of stress, depression, and anxiety; and relationship satisfaction with the . The  was  measured on  behaviour outcomes and relationship satisfaction with the grand. Measures were given at baseline, post-intervention, and at 6-month follow-up. Results: The grand reported significant reductions in stress, anxiety and depression; improved relationship satisfaction with the ; and decreased reliance on dysfunctional  practices. The   reported decreased  behaviour problems and increased relationship satisfaction with the grand. No findings were found for  confidence. Conclusion: This case  provides encouraging findings for a new  program designed specifically for grands, and it is recommended that future  evaluate its efficacy in a randomised controlled trial."
Pressuring and Restrictive Feeding Styles Influence Infant Feeding and Size among a Low-Income African-American Sample,2013,"Objective: The prevalence of overweight among infants and toddlers has increased dramatically in the past three decades, highlighting the importance of identifying factors contributing to early excess weight gain, particularly in high-risk groups. al feeding  and the attitudes and behaviors that characterize al approaches to maintaining or modifying 's eating behavior are an important behavioral component shaping early obesity risk. Design and Methods: Using longitudinal data from the Infant Care and Risk of Obesity Study, a cohort  of 217 African-American mother-infant pairs with feeding , dietary recalls, and anthropometry collected from 3 to 18 months of infant age, we examined the relationship between feeding , infant diet, and weight-for-age and sum of skinfolds. Results: Longitudinal mixed models indicated that higher pressuring and indulgent feeding  scores were positively associated with greater infant energy intake, reduced odds of breastfeeding, and higher levels of age-inappropriate feeding of liquids and solids, whereas restrictive feeding  were associated with lower energy intake, higher odds of breastfeeding, and reduced odds of inappropriate feeding. Pressuring and restriction were  oppositely related to infant size with pressuring associated with lower infant weight-for-age and restriction with higher weight-for-age and sum of skinfolds. Infant size  predicted maternal feeding  in subsequent visits indicating that the relationship between size and feeding  is likely bidirectional. Conclusion: Our  suggest that the degree to which s are pressuring or restrictive during feeding shapes the early feeding environment and, consequently, may be an important environmental factor in the development of obesity."
Overnight care patterns following parental separation: Associations with emotion regulation in infants and young ,2013,"Children living in a shared-time  arrangement following separation ( known as joint physical custody or dual residence) spend equal or near-equal amounts of day and night time with each . Little data exist regarding developmental sequelae of such arrangements for infants. The current  examined a theoretically driven question: Are there associations between quantum of overnight stays away from a primary resident  and the infant's settledness, or emotion regulation with that ? Nationally reative  report data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) were used. Three age bands were studied and three levels of overnight care contrasted. When  , al conflict and socio-economic factors were controlled for, greater number of shared overnight stays for the 0-1 year old and the 2-3 year old groups predicted some less settled and poorly regulated behaviours, but none for the 4-5 year old group. Limits of these data are discussed, including application to the individual case. Findings suggest emotional regulation within the primary infant- relationship is one useful index of infant adjustment to  time arrangements."
Restrictive and Supportive Parenting: Effects on Children's School Affect and Emotional Responses,2010,"In this project upper primary school students were surveyed about their general liking for school, and reasons for going to school. Their s were asked to respond on a questionnaire indicating their restrictiveness and  support for their 's autonomy. Data were collected from 92 middle SES two- families and analysed using SmartPLS path modelling. It was found that  of mothers high on autonomy support enjoyed school more, and endorsed cognitive learning reasons for attending. Restrictive  (in either mothers or fathers) did not relate significantly to school affect, but was associated with elevated levels of negative emotional symptoms, notably loneliness and unhappiness."
Influence of social factors on the relation between lie-telling and 's cognitive abilities,2017,"Lie-telling may be part of a normative developmental process for . However, little is known about the complex interaction of social and cognitive factors related to this developmental behavior. The current  examined  , maternal exposure to stressors, and 's cognitive abilities in relation to 's antisocial lie-telling behavior in an experimental setting. Children (3-6 years, N = 157) participated in a modified temptation resistance paradigm to elicit spontaneous lies. Results indicate that high authoritative  and high inhibitory control interact to predict a lower propensity to lie, but those who did lie had better semantic leakage control. This suggests that although 's lie-telling may be normative during early development, the relation to 's cognitive abilities can be moderated by responsive  behaviors that discourage lying.

Outcomes and Mechanisms of Change of the Strengthening Families Program in a Clinical Sample of Children and Their Families in Austria,2022,"Family context and  behavior have the greatest influence on 's mental health and well-being, and interventions that take the whole family system into account are promising. This  aims to evaluate the outcomes, i.e., family strength,  behavior, and  behavior, of the Strengthening Families Program (SFP), developed by Kumpfer which was implemented in an outpatient clinic of a community-based non-governmental organization in Austria between 2012 and 2018. Furthermore, the program's mechanism of change as formulated by the program authors (i.e., to what extent  behavior mediates the relationship between family strength and  behavior) was tested in this clinical sample. Instruments measuring family strength,  behavior, and  behavior were administered before, immediately after, and 6 months after participation in the SFP. To test the mechanisms of change, a half-longitudinal model was applied with two measurement points (before and after). A total of 62 families (50 boys, 24 girls, and 69 s) participated in the culturally adapted SFP. Regarding the outcomes of the program, all variables yielded significant improvement in all variables. With respect to the mechanism of change, no significant association between the variables could be found. Implications for the implementation of the SFP in a clinical population and how further adaptation of the program could enhance the adherence of this target group are discussed."
Defining and measuring parenting for educational success: A Critical Discourse Analysis of the Parent Education Profile,2008,"The  Education Profile (PEP) is an instrument used by family literacy programs to rate s' support for 's literacy development. This article uses Critical Discourse Analysis to examine how the PEP constructs the ideal , the text's underlying assumptions about  and education, and its ideological effects. The analysis shows how many features of the PEP evaluate s according to a middle-class, predominantly White model of  and family-school interaction. Furthermore, the PEP tends to assume a universal, normative model of al support for literacy, al (mothers') responsibility for educational outcomes, equal access to resources required to meet the PEP standards, and a limited al role in assessment. In so doing, the PEP lends support to several dominant discourses regarding poor and minority families, such as the discourse of  involvement and the mothering discourse, which encourages mothers' supplementary educational work. Implications for policy, , and practice are discussed."
Family predictors of -to-parent violence: the role of family discipline.,2015,"Child-to- violence is a social problem that is qualitatively different from other types of family violence, since adolescents direct their violence toward those who should re authority and provide for their welfare. The main goal of this  was to analyze the role of family relationships and family discipline on violent and prosocial behavior by adolescents toward their s. Participants were 585  aged between 12 and 18 from 8 schools in the Autondinous Community of the Basque Country (Spain). Results show that family relationships based on affect and communication are those that promote prosocial behaviors by  and reduce their violent behaviors at home. However, power-assertive al discipline strategies and partially punitive strategies (monitoring and penalty) were associated to more physical and psychological violence by adolescents toward their s. Finally, implications of these findings for  education are discussed."
"Fatherhood and  with complex healthcare needs: qualitative study of fathering, caring and parenting",2011,"Background: Fathers are increasingly providing substantial amounts of technical and nursing care to growing numbers of  with complex healthcare needs. This exploratory  reports some of the first in-depth evidence of fathers' experiences and s a  agenda in this critically under-ed area. Methods: We conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with 8 fathers who provided a substantial amount of complex technical and nursing care for their  at home. The aim was to describe their experiences of fathering,  and caring. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using Burnard's approach, which has commonalities with phenomenological and content analysis. Results and Discussion: Fathers enjoyed their caring role and found it rewarding and at times stressful. They instituted structured regimes, which focused on the father//family. Performing intimate care posed specific challenges for which there is no guidance. Children's community nursing was highly valued. Fathers generally rejected the need for specific father-focussed services, as such provision would induce guilt feelings. Fathers reported positive relationships with their  and partners. Conclusions: Key areas for future exploration include gaining a better understanding of fathers' motivations and  of caring, developing interventions to support fathers' caring role, developing guidance on intimate care, and delivering tailored services to fathers in a family context. There is little understanding of fathering and caring by non-resident, teenage and step-fathers. Finally, knowing more about resilience and coping of fathers in strong relationships with partners and  may help inform interventions to support fathers who do not feel able to stay with their family."
Early maternal rejection affects the development of monoaminergic systems and adult abusive parenting in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta),2006,"This  investigated the effects of early exposure to variable   and infant abuse on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of monoamine metabolites and examined the role of monoaminergic function in the intergenerational transmission of infant abuse in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatto). Forty-three infants reared by their biological mothers and 15 infants that were cross-fostered at birth and reared by unrelated mothers were followed longitudinally through their first 3 years of life or longer. Approximately half of the infants were reared by abusive mothers and half by nonabusive controls. Abused infants did not differ from controls in CSF concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), homovanillic acid (HVA), or 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylgycol (MHPG). Abused infants, however, were exposed to higher rates of maternal rejection, and highly rejected infants had lower CSF 5-HIAA and HVA than low-rejection infants. The abused females who became abusive mothers in adulthood had lower CSF 5-HIAA than the abused females who did not. A similar trend was  observed among the cross-fostered females, suggesting that low serotonergic function ing from early exposure to high rates of maternal rejection plays a role in the intergenerational transmission of infant abuse."
Mentalization of complex emotions in borderline personality disorder: The impact of parenting and exposure to trauma on the performance in a novel cartoon-based task,2016,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by a range of interpersonal difficulties, which are, in part, related to adverse experiences during hood. Unresponsive  and traumatization may cause functional impairment of mentalization, i.e. the ability to reflect upon own and others' mental states. However, the relationship of poor , trauma and mentalization in BPD has not exhaustively been studied. Thirty patients diagnosed with BPD and 30 matched control subjects were asked to sequence a novel cartoon-based mentalization task involving complex emotions such as jealousy, shame, guilt etc. In addition, they were required to reason about cognitive and affective mental states of the cartoon characters. The quality of al care was assessed using a self-report measure for recalled al rearing , and hood trauma was measured in retrospect using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Patients with BPD performed more poorly in all aspects of the cartoon task. Mentalizing skills, particularly relating to affective mental states, were uniquely associated with the quality of recalled al care and hood trauma. Together, the quality of al care and the experience of hood trauma negatively impact on mentalization in BPD, even in an experimental offline task. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
The timing of verbal/vocal communications between mothers and their infants: A longitudinal cross-cultural comparison,2008,"Early dialogues between  and  constitute an important factor for the acquisition of culture and hence verbal interaction is considered to be a universal  system.  strategies and socialization practices are strongly influenced by the cultural conception of the self, prototypically defined as the model of independence and interdependence. Our  focuses on the temporal organization of spontaneous verbal/vocal behavior of 20 German middle-class and 28 Cameroonian Nso mother-infant dyads. The infants and their mothers were observed weekly in a 5 min free-play interaction scene from 0 to 3 months of age. We hypothesized to find different amounts of vocalization time, synchronous vocalizations, and contingent maternal responses in the verbal/vocal patterns of the two samples. The findings indicate cross-cultural differences in the temporal structure of verbal/vocal interactions already during the first three months of life, reflecting underlying differences in the culture-specific modes of verbal interaction.

Correlates of authoritarian parenting in individualist and collectivist cultures and implications for understanding the transmission of values,2001,"Measures of authoritarianism, collectivism, warmth, anger, attributions for 's misbehavior, and al feelings of control over failure were administered to Egyptian Canadian and Angle-Canadian men and women living in Canada. The Egyptian Canadians were higher on authoritarianism, collectivism. anger and the men were higher on perceived control over failure. The best predictor of authoritarian  for the Egyptian Canadian group was collectivism. For the Angle-Canadian group, the best predictors were collectivism and lack of warmth. Differences in the meaning of authoritarianism in collectivist and individualist groups and their meaning for the transmission of values are discussed: Higher levels of authoritarianism are not necessarily accompanied by overall lower levels of warmth; more negative (dispositional) attributions about ; or more automatic, maladaptive, and inflexible processing of information. Thus, the conditions that promote transmission of values-warmth and benign ways of thinking-are just as likely to be  in groups using authoritarian ."
"The moderation of maternal parenting on the association of trauma, dissociation, and psychosis in depressive inpatients",2022,"Background The effect of dissociation and   on the relationship between psychological trauma and psychotic symptoms has not previously been investigated. Objective The aim of this  was to develop a moderated mediation model to assess whether the association between psychological trauma and psychotic symptoms is mediated by dissociation and moderated by al maltreatment. Methods Inpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar depression (BP) were recruited. Self-reported and clinical rating scales were used to measure the level of dissociation, psychotic symptoms, history of psychological trauma and al maltreatment. The PROCESS macro in SPSS was used to estimate path coefficients and adequacy of the moderated mediation model. High betrayal trauma (HBT), low betrayal trauma (LBT), paternal maltreatment, and maternal maltreatment were alternatively entered into the conceptual model to test the adequacy. Results A total of 91 patients (59 with MDD and 32 with BP) were recruited, with a mean age of 40.59 +/- 7.5 years. After testing with different variables, the moderated mediation model showed that the association between LBT and psychotic symptoms was mediated by dissociation and moderated by maternal maltreatment. A higher level of maternal maltreatment enhanced the effect of LBT on dissociation. Conclusions Healthcare workers should be aware of the risk of developing psychotic symptoms among depressive patients with a history of LBT and maternal maltreatment."
Psychometric Properties of the Parent Cognition Scale in a Clinical Sample of Parents of Children With Disruptive Behavior,2021,"The  Cognition Scale (PCS; Snarr, Slep, & Grande, 2009) is a self-report measure of al attributions of  behavior that has demonstrated validity in community samples. However, its psychometric properties have not been examined in a clinical sample of s of  with disruptive behavior. Examining the psychometric properties of the PCS in this population is important given  linking  attribution with hood disruptive behavior. The   aimed to: (a) examine the psychometric properties of the PCS in a sample of s whose  were clinic-referred for disruptive behavior problems; and (b) investigate the concurrent validity of the PCS and its factors using correlations with  reports of 's emotional and behavioral difficulties, and  skills (i.e., discipline, supervision). A confirmatory factor analysis was run on 225 s' responses on the PCS, and revealed that a two-factor structure of the PCS fit the data well. Significant correlations were found between  Causal Attributions (Factor 1) and -reported  difficulties. Child Responsible Attributions (Factor 2) were correlated with elevations in 's emotion, attention, and conduct difficulties. The  provide information on the utility of the PCS for s of  with disruptive behavior and its potential clinical relevance."
Prospective Effects of Parenting on Substance Use and Problems Across Asian/Pacific Islander and European American Youth: Tests of Moderated Mediation,2017,"Objective: al warmth and knowledge are protective factors against substance use, whereas al psychological control is a risk factor. However, the interpretation of  and its effects on developmental outcomes may vary cross-culturally. This  examined direct and indirect effects of three  dimensions on substance use across Asian/Pacific Islander (API) and European Americans. Method: A community sample of 97 API and 255 European Americans were followed from Grades 6 to 12. Participants reported on  in Grade 7, academic achievement and externalizing behaviors in Grades 7 and 8, and substance use behaviors in Grades 7, 9, and 12. Results: Direct effects of  were not moderated by race. Overall, mother psychological control was a risk factor for substance use problems in Grade 9, whereas father knowledge was protective against alcohol use in Grade 9, substance use problems in Grades 9 and 12, and alcohol dependence in Grade 12. Moderated mediation analyses indicated significant mediational links among European Americans only: Mother knowledge predicted fewer externalizing problems in Grade 8, which in turn predicted fewer substance use problems in Grades 9 and 12. Father warmth predicted better academic achievement in Grade 8, which in turn predicted fewer substance use problems in Grades 9 and 12, as well as alcohol and marijuana dependence in Grade 12. Conclusions: Better academic achievement and fewer externalizing behaviors explain how positive  reduces substance use risk among European Americans. Promoting father knowledge of adolescents' whereabouts can reduce substance use risk among both European and API Americans."
Family relationships as moderators of the association between romantic relationships and adjustment in early adolescence,2003,"The role of adolescents family relationships as moderators of the negative associations between early steady dating and adjustment was investigated. Two hundred forty-four adolescents, 13 to 14 years old, reported on family and peer relationships (attachment security to mother and father, marital conflict,  , friend nominations) and adjustment. As predicted, negative associations between early steady dating and adjustment were moderated by family factors and gender For girls in families high in marital conflict, steady dating was associated with lower self-esteem, and in authoritarian families, with more symptoms of depression. Girls securely attached to their mother and not dating steadily had higher grades. These findings suggest that success in prior relationships contributes to adolescents' abilities to cope with later developmental challenges."
Lie-telling as a mode of antisocial action: Children's lies and behavior problems,2018,"Despite the fact that lie-telling is a common concern among s, clinicians, and professionals, there has been little systematic investigation of the lies that  tell in relation to their problematic behaviors, nor of other social factors that may influence this relation. This  explored the relation between 's problem behaviors and their lie-telling in two studies. The first examined whether  would tell an antisocial lie to an unfamiliar adult to conceal cheating behavior. The second analyzed the relation between 's problem behaviors,  , and the frequency of lies reported by s over two weeks at home. Results suggest that  with higher levels of behavior problems are more likely to tell an antisocial lie to an unfamiliar adult and have a higher frequency of -reported lies. Results  indicate that  approaches moderate the relation between behavior problems and the frequency of lies that s report."
How do Syrian refugee  in Turkey perceive relational factors in the context of their mental health?,2020,"Although there has been increasing attention on the impact of risk and resilience factors on refugee 's mental health, there has been limited evidence on the role of al factors to inform interventions, and this predominantly relies on adult reports. The aim was to investigate the relationship between perceived   and attachment relationships and  mental health, as reported by 322 Syrian refugee minors aged between 8 and 17 years in Turkey. Child-rated scales included the Children Revised Impact of Event Scale-8 (CRIES-8), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), Security Scale and Egna Minnen Betraffande Uppfostran for Children (EMBU-C), and were used as measures of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), general mental health problems, attachment relationships and perceived  , respectively. Children with secure maternal and paternal attachment perceived their s as less rejecting, while  with secure paternal attachment  reported their s as emotionally warmer. Attachment relationships significantly contributed in predicting PTSD after controlling for age and gender, while conduct problems were predicted by lack of emotional warmth, rejection and over-protection by both s, in addition to insecure attachment relationships. Refugee 's views are essential in establishing their needs and planning interventions. These should address both the impact of trauma and current family relationships."
Inter-parental similarity in responsiveness and control and its association with perceptions of the marital relationship,2014,"This  examined how similarities and differences between spouses'   are associated with characteristics of their marital relationship. First, we explored the extent to which husbands and wives are similar or different in their attitudes about and communication of al responsiveness and al control. Then, we investigated how similarity in partners' al communication predicts perceptions of the marital relationship. We conducted a  in which 51 families, consisting of a married heterosexual couple and their 3-6 year old , each completed a survey about their  beliefs and marital relationship and participated in interaction tasks where spouses evaluated each other's  behavior. Independent coders rated - interactions for observed al responsiveness and control. Results showed that spouses were interdependent in terms of observed al responsiveness and both self-reported and observed al control. Multi-level modeling revealed that similarity across spouses in terms of observed al responsiveness and self-reported and observed al control were positively associated with marital satisfaction. In addition, similarity of observed responsiveness and observed control were associated with more positive evaluations of a partner's  behavior. Our  are discussed in terms of implications for understanding co dynamics and interdependence between spouses."
The relation between 's task-specific competence and mothers' controlling practices,2019,"In the guided learning domain of socialization, studies examining the antecedents of controlling  suggest that 's lack of competence in a task could trigger controlling practices in that task. However, a stringent test of this relation remains to be conducted. This  examined this relation using a sample of 101  (M-age = 10.21 years) and their mothers, a standardized measure of 's competence in a task that was unfamiliar to the participants, and multi-informant observational measures of maternal controlling practices during a mother- interaction involving that task (rated by an independent coder and the ). Path analyses showed that 's initial lack of competence in a task was related to higher levels of coded maternal controlling practices during a subsequent mother- interaction involving that task, which in turn were positively linked to 's perceptions of their mothers' practices as controlling. A bootstrap analysis  confirmed that the indirect link from 's competence to perceived maternal controlling practices through coded maternal controlling practices was significant. These effects were observed while controlling for mothers' self-reported controlling   and perceptions of their 's academic skills. Implications of these findings for the promotion of optimal  and future  directions are discussed."
"Parenting behaviors, marital discord and the mental health of young females: a cross-sectional study from Saudi Arabia",2020,"BACKGROUND: Divorce is considered a sentinel event influencing the economic, psychosocial and physical health of the family as a whole. Research shows a negative impact of al marital discord (PMD) on the psychological health and social well-being of . Only one  from Saudi Arabia has assessed educational and social attainment among young females, and the  were school girls aged 12-16 years. OBJECTIVES: Explore the relationship between al marital discord and depression, anxiety, stress, social support and self-esteem of the female . We  studied the  behaviors and their association with the psychosocial health of adolescents. DESIGN: Cross-sectional questionnaire. SETTINGS: Women's university in Saudi Arabia. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: REDCap was used for collecting data through email invitations sent to all students at the university. Data on family structure, al relationship, self-esteem and psycho-social health was collected. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression, anxiety, stress, self-esteem and social support of the adolescent.  behaviors of both s were  assessed. SAMPLE SIZE: 296. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of participants was 20.5 (2.4) years (median 20.0, IQR 19-22). The frequency of PMD was 24.6% (73/296). Overall, 38% of the students had extra severe anxiety, 26.5% had extra severe depression and 20.5% had extra severe stress on the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS). The mean self-esteem score was 20.8 (5.5) and social support score was 57 (19.7). Both s demonstrated low care and high protection trait on the al Bonding Instrument (PBI). Among those with PMD, mean (SD) age at discord was 11.4 (6.7) years. Mean (SD) duration of al marriage was 20.9 (10.7) years and 35% of daughters received no financial help from the father. There was a significant association between PMD and depression, anxiety, stress and poor social support. PMD was associated with low paternal care and high protection trait. CONCLUSIONS: The  showed an alarming burden of mental health problems including depression, anxiety and stress among young Saudi females. Marital discord is prevalent in Saudi Arabia and is significantly related to poor psychosocial health in the . s undergoing marital discord should be educated about healthy   and their  should be provided with counselling and coping strategies to maintain their emotional and psychological well-being. LIMITATIONS: Online survey could lead to volunteer bias. Only females are included in the ."
The Grey-backed Shrike parents adopt brood survival strategy in both the egg and nestling phases,2021,"Background Great diversity exists in the  pattern of altricial birds, which has long been considered as an adaptive response to specific environmental conditions but not to their life-history . Methods We examined the egg-laying and nestling-raising pattern of the Grey-backed Shrike (Lanius tephronotus) that breeds only once a year on the Tibetan Plateau. We compared the dietary composition to that of its sympatric competitor, the Brown-cheeked Laughing Thrush (Trochalopteron henrici) that breeds twice a year. Results Female Grey-backed Shrikes produced a fixed clutch size of five, with increasing egg size by their laying sequence. The last offspring in the brood is disadvantageous in the size hierarchy because it hatches later. However, they had the largest fledgling body mass. These findings indicate that Grey-backed Shrikes adopt the brood survival strategy in both the egg and nestling phases. Moreover, males and females exhibit no sexual division in providing al care as they made an equal contribution to the total amount of food delivered to their brood. This  pattern of Grey-backed Shrikes, as well as their dietary items, differ significantly from those of the Brown-cheeked Laughing Thrush. Conclusions We suggest that the differentiation in life-history  between sympatric competitors, rather than a behavioral response to specific environmental conditions, plays a decisive role in driving avian  strategy diversification."
Parental and family factors for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in Taiwanese ,2007,"Objective: The   aimed to examine the association between attention-deficit - hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD) and maternal psychological distress,   and perceived family support, and the 's interaction with s and behavioural problems at home in Taiwan. Methods: The sample included 375 medicated pediatric patients with DSM- IV ADHD, and 750 school controls selected based on the age and gender structures of the ADHD group. Mothers reported on the Chinese Health Questionnaire, the Chinese versions of the al Bonding Instrument, the Family Adaptation, Partnership, Growth, Affection, and Resolve, and the Home Behaviours of the Social Adjustment Inventory for Children and Adolescents. Results: Mothers of  with ADHD reported greater psychological distress and perceived less support from their families than did mothers of controls. Moreover, mothers of  with ADHD were less affectionate and more overprotective and controlling toward their  than were mothers of controls. This difference was more ap in boys than in girls. Children with ADHD were less likely to interact with their s, yet demonstrated more severe behavioural problems at home. Conclusions: Although the Taiwanese  with ADHD were under treatment with methylphenidate, they and their families still encountered a variety of difficulties in interaction, support, and communication with each other. Therefore, the al approach should be integrated into the medication treatment for ADHD in Taiwan."
Differential Susceptibility to the Effects of Child Temperament on Maternal Warmth and Responsiveness,2013,"A 's difficult temperament can elicit negative  and inhibit positive  behavior. However, mothers appear to be differentially susceptible to  temperament. The author examined the differential susceptibility to the effects of a 's temperament on the mother- interaction  (i.e., maternal warmth and responsiveness) as well as plausible reasons for these differences. With 2,130 mothers of 14-month-old infants (51% male) as subjects, a regression mixture analysis identified three latent classes with varying associations between the 's temperament and mother- interactions: nonsusceptible class, susceptible-high class, and susceptible-low class. Mother-reported depression was most predictive of class membership. Latent class differences in the maternal self-efficacy, marital conflict, and co alliance were  found. On the other hand, family income, maternal employment, and the 's gender were not significant predictors of class membership when individual and contextual resources were considered. Overall, mothers with abundant individual and family resources (i.e., less depressed, highly self-efficacious, few marital conflicts, and high co alliance with their spouse) showed that their interaction  with a  would vary according to the 's temperament, whereas mothers with slender resources interacted with their  in a less warm and responsive manner, regardless of the 's temperament. The implications of these findings are  discussed."
Efficacy of the Tuebinger-Intensiv-Programm fur Eltern in Treating Childhood Anxieties - A Pilot Study,2015,"Anxiety problems among young  are highly prevalent and related to family factors such as  behavior or al psychological health. The current pilot  examined the effectiveness of the non-specific, short-term, behavioral-hypnotherapeutic  training Tip(e) in treating abnormal hood anxieties. Childhood anxiety,  behavior,  sense of competence, and psychological stress of the s were measured at three points in time (pretest, posttest, 3-month follow-up). Obtained data was compared to a waiting-list control condition. After participating, s of the treatment condition reported less dysfunctional  behavior, less psychological stress, and higher  sense of competence. Their  were significantly less anxious. These effects were stable after three months. Families of the waiting-list control condition, however, showed no significant changes. We conclude that a general behavioral-hypnotherapeutic  training positively affects the course of hood anxiety problems."
Do specific parenting practices and related parental self-efficacy associate with physical activity and screen time among primary school? A cross-sectional study in Belgium,2015,"Objectives: To assess the association between specific  practices and related al self-efficacy with 's physical activity (PA) and screen time. al body mass index (BMI), family socioeconomic status (SES), and 's age and gender were examined as possible influencing factors. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: January 2014, Flanders (Belgium). Participants: 207 s (87.4% mothers) of  aged 6-12 years. Outcome measures: Specific  practices, related al self-efficacy, and 's PA and screen time. Results: The majority of investigated  practices and related al self-efficacy were not significantly associated with 's PA or screen time. However,  were more physically active if sports equipment was available at home (p<0.10) and if s did not find it difficult to motivate their  to be physically active (p<0.05). Children had a lower screen time if s limited their own gaming (p<0.01). The associations between  practices and related al self-efficacy with 's PA or screen time were significant for s with a normal BMI, for medium-high SES families and for s of younger . Furthermore, the association between the  relating factors and 's PA and screen time differed for boys and girls. Conclusions: In contrast to what we expected, the findings of the current  show that only a very few specific  practices and related al self-efficacy were associated with 's PA and screen time. It was expected that al self-efficacy would play a more important role. This can be due to the fact that al self-efficacy was already high in this group of s. Therefore, it is possible that s do not realise how difficult it is to perform certain  practices until they are faced with it in an intervention."

Culture Stress and Difficulties: Lived Stories of Teenaged Mothers in Macau,2020,"The traditional Chinese culture influences perspectives toward family, marital status, and living  in Macau SAR, where Eastern cultures meet Western cultures. Although the Western living  and standards highly influence the daily practices of residents; broken marriage, single , and divorce are considered taboo in the community. The purpose of this  was to understand how teenaged single mothers describe their sources of stress and difficulties in the city. Eight single mothers, who were at different stages in single  and broken marriages, were interviewed and asked to share their lived stories. Guided by the Ecological System Theory, analysis of the data indicated that sources of stress and the behaviors of individuals may be highly influenced by surrounding people, environments, and societies. The  of the current  can help social caring providers and policymakers to better understand not only lived experiences of single mothers, but  the social problems, difficulties, and source of stress of the particular groups of people in society."
Parental influences on weight-related health behaviors in western and eastern cultures,2017,"Background Excessive bodyweight contributes to a myriad of risk factors for chronic diseases, and multiple reports have demonstrated that s influence the development of their 's behaviors that contribute to bodyweight. However, studies that include considerations for cultural influences are limited, and methodology that considers direct reports from young adults and their s across cultures does not exist. Methods A sample of young adults (N = 327) and their s in the U.S. and in China were recruited and completed a series of questionnaires in two cycles (2010 and 2014). With correlation and multiple regression analyses, s' characteristics, behaviors, and al authority  were examined and compared to weight-related health behaviors and bodyweight of their young-adult . Additionally, similarities and differences of al influences between the two cultures were explored. Results s' body mass indexes (BMIs) and dietary behaviors were positively associated with those of their young adult  in the mixed-culture sample (P <. 001 for both). When controlling for gender, at high levels of authoritarian and permissive al authority, the relationships between young adults' and their s' BMIs were negative for U.S. participants and positive for Chinese participants (P <. 05 for both). Further, at high levels of authoritarian , the relationship between young adults' and their s' dietary consumption behaviors was negative for U.S. participants and positive for Chinese participants (P <. 001). Conclusions This  provides evidence that the development of life-long health behaviors that contribute to BMI are significantly influenced by s' behaviors and  . Moreover, an interaction of al characteristics and cultural norms is indicated."
Ethnic Socialization in Current and Prospective Parents,2021,"Few studies have examined whether the manner in which one has been ed impacts one's subsequent   regarding ethnic socialization. We examined this question in current and prospective s. First, we found that receiving greater familial ethnic socialization is significantly correlated with stronger subsequent al ethnic socialization (PES) for both current and prospective s. Second, we found that PES did not significantly differ between current and prospective s. Third, given the limited  examining the ethnic socialization experiences of those who are White, we examined these questions specifically for our White participants. Our findings persisted when we examined all ethnicities together and when we examined White participants alone."
Being a father: constructions of fatherhood by men with absent fathers,2020,"Family dynamics and   are influential on 's wellbeing [Walsh, F. (2016). Strengthening family resilience (3rd ed.). New York: Guilford Press]. Additionally, hood experiences and how an individual experienced being ed can impact on how individuals as mothers and fathers choose to  their own  [Herland, M. D., Hauge, M.-I., & Helegland, I. M. (2015). Balancing fatherhood: Experiences of fatherhood among men with a difficult past.Qualitative Social Work,14(2), 242-258]. However, growing up in a home with an absent  may create challenges associated with  for individuals, due to not having these experiences themselves. Therefore, the article reports findings on men who grew up in a father-absent household and how their experiences influenced their understanding of fatherhood and becoming a father. Twenty-one men participated in this qualitative . Findings revealed that although men felt unprepared for fatherhood they attempted to learn to be a father and expressed the importance of not wanting their  to experience father absence. The  findings provide important insights in the provision of support for fathers who have experienced father absence."
"Is Teen Risk of Having Sex With Strangers Associated With Family Environment? Family Processes, Household Structure, and Adolescent Sex With Strangers",2020,"Research on family contexts and adolescent sexual risk behavior has largely neglected relational aspects of sexual risk, such as having sex with strangers. The   uses the NLSY97 to examine associations between sexually active adolescents' sex with strangers and al monitoring, support, strictness, and household structure. More than 12% of the sample report having sex with a stranger within the past year (19% of boys and 5% of girls). Generalized estimating equation models indicate that high monitoring and strictness may have protective effects for risk of sex with strangers, whereas inconsistent   and living in biological-father/stepmother homes may increase this risk. Boys appear to respond more strongly to al strictness than girls, and mothers'  processes may matter more for risk of sex with strangers than fathers'. These findings suggest there are gendered ways that healthy family contexts might reduce adolescents' risk of sex with strangers."
Parent perceived control and stress in families of  with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactive Disorder,2013,"This  will deal with the construct of perceived control in difficult -rearing interactions with s of ADHD . It has been hypothesized that a) these s develop low self-control schemata as  of a transactional history of failure interactions with their  more often than s of non-problem , and b) low perceived control beliefs are associated with increased al stress and punitive/inconsistent discipline practices. Results show significant differences between families as a function of 's clinical condition, with higher stress levels and lower perceived control in s of ADHD , but they do not support the influence of low-power attribution  on increased stress both in ADHD and non-clinical families. Finally, the influence of perceived control on  practices changes as a function of 's clinical condition with an increment of inconsistent and punitive  in association with low perceived control only for ADHD s. An unexpected  is the higher level of positive  in ADHD s if compared to non-clinical ones who, as initially assumed, report more affection in association with high perceived control attributions. Implications for assessing perceived control beliefs in families of  with behavioral disorders, particularly for the treatment of the ADHD, are discussed."
Validation of the TOSCA to measure shame and guilt,2003,"A college student sample (190 females, 148 males) was administered the Test of Self-Conscious Affect (TOSCA), which yields scales for shame and guilt. Subjects were  measured on perceived , personality dimensions, religiosity, and psychological adjustment. There was some evidence that al overprotection was associated with shame in males and guilt in females, while religiosity was largely not predictive of shame or guilt. Personality measures indicative of external locus of control and poor self-regulation were significantly correlated with shame for both males and females, with smaller effects in the opposite direction for guilt. For both genders, shame was highly predictive of poorer psychological adjustment, as measured by self-esteem, perceived stress, and psychiatric symptomatology, while guilt was uncorrelated with adjustment. These  support the validity of the TOSCA and suggest that shame is a significant risk factor for poor psychological adjustment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."
