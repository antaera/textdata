College performance and  of 298 State GEAR UP s were compared with other first-time, first-year s (1,841) who entered a moderately selective, medium-sized public research  in Fall 2012. The GEAR UP s were more likely to be from disadvantaged, underrepresented backgrounds; despite less advantageous beginnings, they entered  with similar high school grade point average and Scholastic Assessment Test scores, though lower American College Test scores. Also, s' first-term grade point average and credit loads served as predictors of . Most importantly, GEAR UP s were just as likely to perform and persist as their peers.",2018
"Oseguera, Leticia; Rhee, Byung Shik",The Influence of Institutional Retention Climates on  Persistence to Degree Completion: A Multilevel Approach,RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION,"Using multi-institutional data from the Cooperative Institutional Research Program's (CIRP) annual survey of entering freshmen, the Higher Education Research Institute's (HERI) Faculty Surveys, campus registrars' offices, and IPEDS data, we evaluated the extent to which peer institutional  climates and faculty perceived campus climates influenced individual 6-year  rates. We used hierarchical generalized linear models (HGLM) to examine the extent to which institutional climate (as measured by peer institutional  climate and faculty perceived climate), net of s' ability, expectations, and family socioeconomic status, influence s'  behavior. We found that institutional  climate, as defined by a  body's aggregated report of withdrawal intentions, did independently determine whether a  would persist or not. While past research has overlooked peer and faculty climates, the results from this work call for the attention of peer institutional  climates.",2009

Despite the evolution of open , an overall high  attrition rate remains. This paper examines the changes and trends in factors related to   in open universities. It reviews the empirical studies from the 1970s to the 2010s which reported factors influencing  . The relevant studies were searched from databases, including Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Among the 108 studies collected, a total of 284 factors influencing   were identified. The factors were categorised into  factors, institutional factors, and environmental factors. Their changes and trends over the years were examined. The results show that  factors were the most frequently studied over the years examined, with the major categories being s' psychological attributes and outcomes. Institutional factors have been increasingly studied in recent decades, with the design and delivery of programmes and courses being the strongest category. Finally, environmental factors have been decreasingly examined, with factors related to s' family and work being the two main categories. Based on the results, the implications for developing intervention and  strategies for   in open universities are discussed.",2019

An online doctoral school implemented a first-year program sequence taught by a cadre of 20 specialized faculty members who engage in best practices to assist s in persisting and progressing toward program completion. Design/methodology/approach This qualitative program assessment using content analysis examined the program effectiveness of one online doctoral program's first-year program sequence. Two research questions guided this program assessment, they were: RQ1. Based on online doctoral s' perspectives, what motivators contribute to online doctoral   and progression in an online doctoral program? RQ2. How do online faculty contribute to online doctoral   and progression? Data collection included myriad of program metrics: content area meetings (CAMs); closing the loop assessment data; faculty and  end of course survey data; and faculty and  semistructured interviews. Findings The resultant themes indicated that s are motivated by support from family, friends and religious beliefs; and s persist based on support from fellow doctoral s and faculty members. Additional themes revealed that faculty members motivate s through building faculty- relationships, individual coaching, providing  resources and through clarification of program requirements; and faculty members perceive that face-to-face doctoral residencies greatly contribute to   and progression through interpersonal interaction and through improved clarity.

The approach included using a descriptive correlational design and regression analysis to examine the relationship between engagement indicators and  among first-year, full-time Hispanic s and . Purposeful sampling obtained from the HERI data set resulted in a sample size of 1,206 s who attended public  and 1,187 s who attended private . Findings - Analysis of the results disclosed a positive correlation between first-year Hispanic s' intent to persist, satisfaction with peer interactions, amount of contact with faculty, first-year programs and sense of belonging. The results of the analysis disclosed differences between public and private . Of the collective variables, satisfaction with amount of contact with faculty and sense of belonging are significant predictors of . Research limitations/implications - The sample of the study was limited to the use of archival data and the responses to specific questions obtained from the 2014 YFCY survey. Factors such as insufficient experience at the  s are attending, unwillingness to provide honest feedback and exaggerating specific areas of their behavior or performance may affect s who respond to surveys (Kuh, 2004), affecting the accuracy of the data.

Cause and effect cannot be determined from correlational analysis, and the possibility exists that an unknown variable may be the cause of a correlation within the study. Incomplete information from predictors, complete separation and overdispersion can lead to SPSS output errors for logistic regression analysis. Social implications - It is important for   administrators to understand the cultural differences of not only Hispanic s but other ethnic and racial groups. As a global society, public and private    are looking for more inclusion of multi-cultural s. Recruitment is obviously important, but to recruit is not enough.

"Bowman, Nicholas A.; Holmes, Joshua M.",Getting off to a good start? First-year undergraduate research experiences and student outcomes,HIGHER EDUCATION,"Undergraduate research is widely perceived as a high-impact practice that promotes s' learning, cognition, career planning, and al attainment. With some exceptions, the existing evidence largely provides support for these beliefs. However, these studies typically examine research experiences that occur later in the undergraduate years, whereas engaging in undergraduate research during the first year is becoming increasingly common. First-year experiences may yield different outcomes than later experiences for a variety of reasons; in addition, previous studies often do not account sufficiently for self-selection into undergraduate research, which may be especially problematic for cross-sectional studies that occur in the junior or senior year. Therefore, this study examines the potential impact of first-year undergraduate research using propensity score analyses within a large, multi-institutional, longitudinal dataset. Research participation is significantly and positively related to first-year  satisfaction and fourth-year undergraduate GPA, but it is unrelated to satisfaction and grades in other years as well as graduate degree intentions,  at the same institution, and 4-year graduation.

Specifically, the authors investigate the reasons doctoral s consider leaving their programs, and how these reasons may differ for international and domestic s. The authors also examine international-domestic patterns by sex and by program of study. Design/methodology/approach - As part of a campus-wide doctoral program assessment, doctoral s and recent graduates at a large, public, Research I institution in the Midwest region of the USA are asked to complete a program satisfaction survey. Content analysis of open-ended survey responses is the basis of the analysis. Next, a code by committee approach is used whereby two members of the research team coded all open-ended responses and discussed discrepancies to reach consensus on all codes assigned, and to reduce individual biases. Each open-ended response is assigned at least one of 16 codes, with more than one code used as necessary. Findings - The results suggest that, although both academic and social factors are important influences of doctoral departure in general, academic concerns - specifically, alignment with goals, career preparation and program structure - may be particularly important for international s, whereas social aspects - faculty relationships and program climate - may be more important for domestic US s. Research limitations/implications - Researchers should consider conducting larger, multi-institutional studies in the USA, which would reflect a diversity of perspectives and experiences within the American context. Parallel studies of doctoral programs in other countries may be useful in identifying whether similar factors are found for international and domestic s attending those programs. Follow-up interviews could be used to further delve into and understand the emergent patterns from the surveys. The findings of such future studies have the power to inform programs and policies designed to increase the  of both domestic and international doctoral s. Practical implications - Given that faculty/advising is one of the most important factors cited by both domestic and international s, our findings suggest that US faculty members may need to give more attention to nurturing supportive relationships with their advisees. Furthermore, American  administrators might consider changing tenure requirements and reward systems for professors to place more emphasis on cultivating positive relationships with advisees, publishing, presenting and writing grants with advisees, and providing high-quality mentoring for doctoral s. Doctoral-granting  should consider implementing regular program reviews that include surveys from doctoral s to help programs identify and meet their s' needs. Originality/value - Likewise, while other research on international s' doctoral experiences has been conducted, such as the relationship with their faculty advisor (Kim, 2007; Rice et al., 2009), single studies that focus on factors affecting the attrition of domestic versus that of international s' remain limited. The purpose of this study is to address the following research questions: What factors contribute to doctoral s' considerations of departure in the USA?

Findings indicated that bridge programs varied in their offering of academic classes, academic support (e.g., study skills), research experiences, professional development, and planned social activities. s attending HBCUs scored more favorably than s at PWIs on some measures; however, these differences could be accounted for by satisfaction with bridge experiences. Satisfaction with specific aspects of the bridge programs, especially orientation activities and getting to know other s, were associated with feelings of belonging and STEM self-efficacy. These relations were stronger for belonging. Over the course of the academic year, the relations between bridge satisfaction and belonging and self-efficacy weakened.",2021

In spite of the growth, the high dropout rate in online learning has been of concern to many    and organizations. The purpose of this study was to determine whether persistent learners and dropouts are different in individual characteristics (i.e., age, gender, and al level), external factors (i.e., family and organizational supports), and internal factors (i.e., satisfaction and relevance as sub-dimensions of motivation). Quantitative data were collected from 147 learners who had dropped out of or finished one of the online courses offered from a large Midwestern . Dropouts and persistent learners showed statistical differences in perceptions of family and organizational support, and satisfaction and relevance. It was also shown that the theoretical framework, which includes family support, organizational support, satisfaction, and relevance in addition to individual characteristics, is able to predict learners' decision to drop out or persist. Organizational support and relevance were shown to be particularly predictive.

"Ronfeldt, Matthew; Schwartz, Nathaniel; Jacob, Brian A.",Does Preservice Preparation Matter? Examining an Old Question in New Ways,TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD,"Background: Over the past decade, most of the quantitative studies on teacher preparation have focused on comparisons between alternative and traditional routes. There has been relatively little quantitative research on specific features of teacher  that might cause certain pathways into teaching to be more effective than others. The vast majority of evidence on features of preservice preparation comes from qualitative case studies of single  that prepare teachers. Among the few large-scale cross-institution studies that exist, most provide only descriptive trends that fail to account for teacher and school characteristics that might explain apparent relationships in the data. Additionally, these studies typically look at state-or district-level data, providing little information on national trends. Purpose: Focusing on two features of preparation commonly targeted by certification policies, this study asks: Does completing more practice teaching and methods-related coursework predict teachers'  and perceived instructional preparedness? Do the results vary for different kinds of teachers and schools. Research Design: This is a secondary analysis of data from the two most recent administrations of the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), a nationally representative survey of teachers that includes information about preservice preparation, , and perceptions of preparedness. We link surveyed teachers to Common Core of Data on their schools and to Barron's ratings of  competitiveness. Data Analysis: We use linear and logistic regression with state and district fixed effects, as well as comprehensive controls for school and teacher characteristics, to estimate whether completing more practice teaching and methods-related coursework predicts teachers' self-perceived instructional preparedness and  in the profession. Findings: We find that teachers who completed more methods-related coursework and practice teaching felt better prepared and were more likely to stay in teaching. These positive relationships were similar across alternative and traditional routes and tended to be greater among graduates from competitive s, males, and mathematics and science teachers, as well as teachers in urban, rural, and secondary schools. Conclusions: Our study provides some of the best suggestive evidence to date that teacher  programs, and certification policies that influence them, can improve teachers' preparedness and  by increasing requirements for practice teaching and methods-related coursework. Policy makers often consider reducing preparation requirements to increase the supply of academically talented and underrepresented teacher groups. Finding these groups to be at least as, and usually more, responsive to additional preparation raises some concern that reducing requirements could have negative consequences for their preparedness and .",2014

Design/methodology/approach Tinto's (2004) and Bean and Metzner's (1985) models serve as the theoretical construct for the study's design and analysis. In-depth interviews were conducted with 41 s who discontinued studies at universities in the United Arab Emirates, to understand the situations that led them to drop out of  and how they experienced this event in their lives. Findings Several issues were identified as contributing factors for dropping out that are consistent with those found in the international literature. Additional issues were more gender or culture specific and, to some extent, represented the differences that signal a social development that is in a transitional stage. The findings revealed that institutional factors, poor pre- preparation, environmental factors (work- conflict), early marriage responsibilities, well-paid job opportunities and financial concerns were most influential. Research limitations/implications - Despite the limitations of relying on a small sample to generalize findings, the rich detail of this inductive study has added to the understanding of the dropout phenomenon in a new context. Practical implications - The paper recommends both remedial and early intervention strategies to be undertaken by the Ministry of Education and universities. Remedial strategies include re-examining the desired standard of English as a condition for admission and adjusting the grading system. Early intervention measures that accommodate the needs of at-risk s are also proposed. At local, regional and international levels,   should be freed from commodification and inflated fees.

Faculty interest groups provide opportunities for faculty across disciplines to meet to explore common interests and share concerns and best practices. The faculty interest group described in this  was designed to explore and address the challenges faced by historically underrepresented faculty and facilitate the process of attaining reappointment, promotion, and tenure. Nationwide, nearly half of community  s come from populations that are also historically underrepresented, and community s are challenged to recruit and retain faculty that mirror the  body. Research demonstrates that historically underrepresented faculty members enrich the overall  of all s, and yet a significant number of those faculty members describe their  campuses as unwelcoming. Factors that make campuses unwelcoming for these faculty include, but are not limited to, the following: isolation and marginalization; salary disparities; microaggressions based on race, gender, and sexual identity; heightened visibility; and additional role demands. Community  administrators ought to be concerned with historically underrepresented faculty members' satisfaction and  on campus because these faculty members are vital members of the academy. Faculty interest groups for historically underrepresented faculty may provide the support and professional development opportunities that will ensure their  and success in academia.",2015
"Mckee, Holly",An Instructor Learning Analytics Implementation Model,ONLINE LEARNING,"With the widespread use of learning analytics (LA) tools, there is a need to explore how these technologies can be used to enhance teaching and learning. Little research has been conducted on what human processes are necessary to facilitate meaningful adoption of LA. The research problem is that there is a lack of evidence-based guidance on how instructors can effectively implement LA to support s. The goal of the study was to develop and validate a model to guide instructors in the implementation of LA tools. Using design and development research methods, an implementation model was constructed and validated internally. Themes emerged falling into the categories of adoption and caution with six themes falling under adoption including: LA as evidence, reaching out, frequency, early identification/intervention, self-reflection, and align LA with pedagogical intent. Three themes emerged falling under the category of caution including: skepticism, fear of overdependence, and question of usefulness. The model should enhance instructors' use of LA by enabling them to better take advantage of available technologies to support teaching and learning in online and blended learning environments. Researchers can further validate the model by studying its usability (i. e., usefulness, effectiveness, efficiency, and learnability), as well as, how instructors' use of this model to implement LA in their courses affects , , and performance.",2017

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effects the course have on s in regard to three aspects:  awareness and utilization of resources, interaction patterns, as well as, general interests and attitudes toward  . Design/methodology/approach - The methodology of the assessment included analysis of a survey that has been conducted by the end of Spring 2014 semester. A quasi-experimental design was implemented to measure the impact of the intervention on s' awareness and utilization of resources, interactions, general interests, and attitudes toward  . Through the SPSS application, the Mann Whitney U Test, and chi(2) tests were used to check for significant differences while comparing the means or frequencies for both groups. For the three questions, the authors have used the 90 percent confidence level and the standard significance level p-value of 0.05 or less for statistical analysis. Findings - The results indicated that the course had a highly significant positive impact on  attitudes and awareness of campus resources but had less significant impact on  interactions and utilization of resources. The results in this study reveal a positive impact for the first-year seminar course on  satisfaction and attitudes toward   as well as their awareness of campus resources. However, in terms of the course impact on  interaction, results conveyed that s who have participated in the first-year seminar course show a slightly better interaction rate with instructors, academic advisors, and close friends than those in the control group.

Design/methodology/approach Within the context of a  scholarship and faculty development project, funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), STEM faculty members were interviewed at a small teaching-focused  in South Texas, United States. This research study utilized a qualitative case study approach based on semi-structured interviews with nine Mathematics and Computer Science faculty members. Transcripts were coded thematically, beginning with open coding and continuing with repeated rounds of comparison leading to the identification of four themes. Findings Four themes were identified in the data: describing settings where mentoring occurs, identifying the tasks of mentoring, developing skills for mentoring others and inhabiting the identity of a mentor. These findings suggest that increasing faculty engagement and effectiveness in mentoring STEM s may be a matter of broadening the definition of mentoring and helping faculty members develop the identity of a mentor. Practical implications In an effort to promote  of s, specifically within STEM fields, many initiatives highlight the importance of faculty mentoring for undergraduate s.

Some environmental behaviour models suggest that this can be accomplished in part by improving people's knowledge. Recent studies have identified a distinct, psychometrically supported environmental knowledge structure consisting of system, action-related and effectiveness knowledge. Besides system knowledge, which is most often the focus of such studies, incorporating the other knowledge dimensions into these dimensions was suggested to enhance effectiveness. Our study is among the first to implement these dimensions together in an al campaign and to use these dimensions to evaluate the effectiveness of a programme on water issues. We designed a four-day environmental  programme on water issues for s at an al field centre. We applied a newly developed multiple-choice instrument using a pre-, post-,  test design. The knowledge scales were calibrated with the Rasch model. In addition to the commonly assessed individual change in knowledge level, we also measured the change in knowledge convergence, the extent to which the knowledge dimensions merge as a person's environmental knowledge increases, as an innovative indicator of al success. Following programme participation, s significantly improved in terms of amount learned in each knowledge dimension and in terms of integration of the knowledge dimensions. The effectiveness knowledge shows the least gain,  and convergence, which we explain by considering the dependence of the knowledge dimensions on each other. Finally, we discuss emerging challenges for al researchers and practical implications for environmental educators.",2015

Little research exists, however, on faculty perceptions of faculty advising models, specifically at small, Christian  where employing professional advising personnel might not be affordable or feasible. Such information is valuable, as it highlights the strengths and challenges of faculty advising models and gives insight to the resources or tools that faculty might need to perform this increasingly demanding job function. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore faculty perceptions of faculty advising at small, Christian universities. Conducted at three Christian , this case study research resulted in both comparative and individual institutional findings. The commonalities across these cases were that faculty knew and enjoyed their s, but did not feel like they had time to adequately advise them. At the individual institutional level, faculty at the first institution saw the function and process of academic advising as different from enrollment. The faculty also seemed to be disengaged from their general  courses. The second institutional findings were that faculty accessibility and service were vital to academic advising, as personal interactions were believed to contribute to  success.

The Relationship Between Interpersonal Interaction Based on Motivation and Educational Outcomes Among s in Manufacturing Programs at Two-Year Technical Colleges,COMMUNITY COLLEGE REVIEW,": This study explored the relationship between different types of interpersonal interaction, characterized by their underlying motivations, and al outcomes among s in manufacturing programs at two-year s. While there exist several ways to classify interaction, motivation as an inherent attribute that fuels behaviors has been largely neglected. In this study, we developed a nuanced approach to differentiating types of interaction based on s' underlying motivation and further investigated how different forms of interaction are related to al outcomes. Method: We analyzed the Community College Survey of  Engagement data and administrative records of 242 s entering manufacturing programs during 2011-2012 at four public two-year technical s in Wisconsin. The outcome variables were s' cumulative grade point average (GPA) and their /graduation status as of spring 2013. A multiple regression model and a logistic regression model were separately estimated. Results: We found that interaction can be grouped into three categories that represent different underlying motivations: interaction as a response to curricular demands, interaction for broader al purposes, and interaction for diverse experiences. Interaction for broader al purposes was positively associated with GPA, but interaction as a response to curricular demands had a negative relationship with GPA. Diversity-related interaction moderated the relationship between  under-preparedness and /graduation status.

While some scholars argue that employers prioritize the degree, and not institutional affiliation, in hiring graduates, the argument needs to be warranted with more recent data accounting for the changing market structure. Furthermore, some studies found that having a STEM degree matters more than institutional selectivity, particularly for occupational outcomes of women and racial minorities. Yet there is slim empirical evidence to support this conclusion. Using data from the National Survey of Recent College Graduates, we examine how occupational outcomes are different for different STEM degrees generated by different selectivity of  for those who graduated in the 1990s, early and mid-2000s, and late 2000s. Female graduates, although they entered the industry and STEM fields at no different levels from their male counterparts, still earned significantly lower wages.

"Yamada, Hiroyuki; Bryk, Anthony S.",Assessing the First Two Years' Effectiveness of Statway (R): A Multilevel Model With Propensity Score Matching,COMMUNITY COLLEGE REVIEW,": Statway is a community  pathways initiative developed by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching designed to accelerate s' progress through their developmental math sequence to acquiring  math credit in statistics. Statway is a multifaceted change initiative designed to address the complex problems that impede  success. Specifically, it is a one-year pathway program through which s acquire  math credit. Instructors use research-based learning principles to improve the content and pedagogy for  learning and incorporate social-psychological interventions to sustain  engagement and . In addition, language supports for s' accessibility to mathematics learning are integrated into the curriculum. Professional development resources assist faculty as they teach new content utilizing unfamiliar pedagogies. Statway is organized as a networked improvement community intending to accelerate educators' efforts to continuously improve. This study was aimed to assess the effectiveness of Statway during its first two years of implementation. Method: We applied a multilevel model with propensity score matching to control for possible selection bias and increase the validity of causal inference. Results: We found large effects of Statway on s attaining  math credit with persisting effects into the following year as Statway s also accumulated more -level credits. These improved outcomes emerged for each gender and race/ethnicity groups and for s with different math placement levels. Conclusion: This study provided robust evidence that Statway increases  success in acquiring  math credit and enhances equity in  outcomes. Directions for future work are suggested.",2016
"Hicks, Terence; Wood, J. Luke",A meta-synthesis of academic and social characteristic studies First-generation college students in STEM disciplines at HBCUs,JOURNAL FOR MULTICULTURAL EDUCATION,"Purpose - Given that a relatively large percentage of  s entering historically black s and universities (HBCUs) are first-generation s and considering the low completion rate among this group in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) discipline, the purpose of this preliminary meta-synthesis study is intended to facilitate a greater understanding of the academic and social adjustment among  s, particularly first-generation  s enrolled in STEM disciplines at HBCUs. Therefore, this meta-synthesis will shed light and offer important recommendations for  administrators and faculty members in supporting the academic and social adjustment of these s in STEM fields at HBCUs. Design/methodology/approach - This review of literature was conducted using a meta-synthesis approach (also referred to as integrative review). A meta-synthesis is based on a process by which findings across multiple studies are organized and presented (Turner, Gonzalez and Wood, 2008; Wood, 2010). This approach is used to provide insight to academicians and practitioners alike on the status of research on a given phenomenon (Bland, Meurer and Maldonado, 1995; Patterson, Thorne, Canam and Jillings, 2001; Wood, 2010). We engaged in a cyclical process of collecting, annotating, and synthesizing research over a 45-year time-frame (1970 to 2015). This produced over 50 cited resources with more than 100 scholars including peer-reviewed s, reports, books, book chapters, and conference papers. Findings - Factors present in the literature that affected s enrolled in a STEM program at a HBCU are grouped into three contexts: (a) first-generation academic and social characteristics, (b) first-generation  dropout and transition, and (c) first-generation STEM . Tables 2 to 4 provide these contexts by author and year of publication. Within these general groupings, four interrelated themes emerged from the literature: (a) prior academic performance and STEM discipline, (b)  adjustment and STEM discipline, (c) social integration and STEM discipline, and (d) academic integration and STEM discipline. Originality/value - This information may help professors and  professionals in the STEM fields to be more aware of the challenges faced by incoming  s. More empirical work is needed in this area in a way that is useful for understanding and enhancing professors' and  professionals' knowledge. To this end, research that carefully describes what HBCU professors and  professionals know or their ideas about teaching  s, especially first-generation s enrolled in the STEM discipline, is needed.",2016
"Hatch-Tocaimaza, Deryl K.; Garcia, Crystal E.; Mardock-Uman, Naomi; Rodriguez, Sarah L.; Young, Dallin George",What Works: Learning Outcomes Due to Design Variations in Community College  Success Courses,TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD,"Background/Context: Based on well-established evidence that certain  success skills and  knowledge are closely associated with academic achievement, , and completion, community s increasingly implement various types of first year  success courses and programs. However, by looking only at the distal impact of program participation, the question of whether these programs act 'tally influence those mediating skills of  success has scarcely been investigated in the   literature, let alone which program features may be determining factors. Purpose/: This study examined the scope and design of community   success courses to address which program features relate to learning objectives of  success skills,  knowledge, and engagement. Population/Participants/Subjects: Participants were s and instructors drawn from 47  success course sections at 42 public community s in 24 states, representing all U.S. geographic regions. Research Design: The study adopted a multimodal research design, using both qualitative and quantitative research methods while primarily relying on quantitative analysis. Data Collection and Analysis: s in selected  success course sections completed a pre- and postsurvey. Instructors participated in a structured interview and provided course syllabi. Course design information was quantitized and merged with -level data to model variation in learning outcomes as a function of course features, according to an activity theory conceptual framework. Data were analyzed using hierarchical linear modeling. Conclusions: Findings from this research point to several recommendations for practice by highlighting the reality that one term may be too little to learn some  success skills and that particular features of course designs may result in unintended adverse effects. Results indicate that structural elements are the most impactful features and that the skills-based curricular features that receive the most attention may be in fact the least influential features in realizing desired skills and knowledge outcomes. The study points to methodological ways forward to further explore and unpack the relationship between success course design features and al outcomes.",2019

"Goeman, Katie; Deschacht, Nick",The learning strategies of mature students: a study of social science students in Belgium,JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION,"Purpose Though different claims are made in the literature with regard to learning approach differences between mature and non-mature  s, the issue seems to bare detailed study. The purpose of this paper is to report about an investigation of mature and non-mature  s' learning strategies. The authors examine the relationship between age and learning strategy, and assess to what extent this relationship is mediated by individual and contextual factors. Design/methodology/approach Using original survey data on 448  s enroled in Social Sciences programmes in Belgium, this paper examines the relationship between age and learning strategy and assesses to what extent this relationship is mediated by individual and contextual factors. Findings The results of the multinomial logistic regression show significant differences in learning strategies between both groups of learners. The analyses suggest that mature s are 15.3 percentage points more likely than regular s to adopt a navigator learning strategy. The navigator strategy develops in a non-linear way between the ages 30 and 37. Moreover, only a small part of the learning strategies of mature learners can be explained by mediating factors, with the job involvement playing a particular role. Research limitations/implications - This study contributes to the body of knowledge concerning the assessment and classification of learning strategies, including a focus on mediators affecting such strategies. The results are confined to only two   (HE) . Furthermore, there may be a non-response bias; it is plausible that we miss among the respondents a particular type of mature s such as those that do not like to participate or those that have dropped out of their master's programme. By means of larger, random samples in future research we should verify this study's conclusions. This study did not include motivation as a variable. However, it might also explain why mature and non-mature s' learning approaches differ. Further research could entangle motivational components in relation to learners' studying approaches. Practical implications - The research results contribute to our understanding to what extent mature and non-mature s' learning strategies differ and which mediators are prevalent in explaining these differences. It helps to understand how universities can create a supportive academic environment for mature learners. Social implications - The authors found significant differences with regard to learning strategies between mature and non-mature  s. Furthermore, having a professional occupation plays a mediating role in explaining learning strategy differences. The study raises the issue of learner-centred HE, with considerations about differentiated designs of learning environments, programmes and support services targeting s of different ages. By integrating the Assessing the Learning Strategies of Adults instrument, instructional designers can identify learning strategies and take appropriate action to accommodate learners. Additionally, awareness of one's own learning strategy strengthens mature s' decision making in self-directed learning environments. In that respect, the authors note also that  pedagogical flexibility, i.e. more varied al formats, tracks and study arrangements, ensures adult learners' access,  and  in HE. Originality/value Previous studies suggest that  learning approaches are distinguishable, but did not yet focus on differences between non-mature and mature s. As the authors include graduate s in this study, the focus is on a group which has not been studied previously.",2019

The opportunity to engage in hands-on, discovery-based activities as part of a community helps s develop a strong self-identity in STEM and strengthens their self-efficacy in what can otherwise be daunting fields. Kansas State University has developed an array of undergraduate research opportunities, both in the academic year and summer, and has established a management infrastructure around these programs. The Graduate School, which hosts its own Summer Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program aimed at URM and first-generation  s, coordinates the leadership of the other grant-funded programs, and conducts a series of enrichment and networking activities for s from all the programs. These include professional development as well as primarily social sessions. The Kansas LSAMP, led by Kansas State University, created a summer program aimed at under-represented minority community  s enrolled in STEM fields to recruit them into research opportunities at K-State. There has been strong interest in the program, which incorporated  experience elements in addition to an introduction to STEM research and the four-year . In the 5 years since the program's inception, cohorts of nine to fourteen s came to K-State each year for eight-week experiences and took part in both cohort-based sessions and individual mentored research experiences. The two-fold focus of this program, Research Immersion: Pathways to STEM, has resulted in the majority of the s presenting a poster at a national conference and transferring to a STEM major at a four-year institution. Survey results showed that the program was successful at improving STEM identity and academic self-concepts. Qualitative feedback suggested that the two parts of the program worked together to increase interest and self confidence in STEM majors but also ensured that s connect with other s and felt comfortable in the transition to a 4-year institution.",2021

"Mgardle, Erin E.; Turner, Jennifer D.",I'm Trying to Beat a Stereotype: Suburban African American Male s' Social Supports and Personal Resources for Success in AP English Coursework,TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD,"Background: African American male s attending U.S. suburban schools remain severely underrepresented in Advanced Placement (AP) programs. A number of structural barriers, including racialized tracking policies; limited referrals from educators and school counselors; conventional AP practices centered on Eurocentric curricula, literature, and pedagogies; and educators' deficit mindsets toward Black masculinity, mitigate African American male s' access to and success in suburban AP classrooms. Despite these sobering realities, African American male s have achieved success in AP English Language Arts coursework. Yet few researchers have investigated the multiple and complex farms of support to which African American male s attribute their successful performance in AP English coursework in suburban high schools. Purpose/Research Question: In an effort to close opportunity gaps in AP English programs, the present study illuminates the social supports and personal resources that African American male s mobilized to earn exemplary grades (i.e., maintaining a grade of B- or ,, or 79.6% or  out of 100%) in an AP English Language and Composition and/or an English Literature and Composition course, and earn a passing score on the formal AP exam (i.e., 3 or ). Countering deficit-oriented research paradigms, we employed an anti-deficit achievement framework to (re)position young African American men as capable. motivated, and agentive learners who marshal complex supportive networks, as well as their own personal resources, to successfully learn academic literacies in AP English classrooms. Our inquiry was guided by the following research question: To what social supports and personal resources do young African American men who graduated from a suburban high school attribute their success in AP English caursework? Participants: Eight young African American men who were enrolled in AP English coursework in a suburban Mid-Atlantic secondary school were the participants in this study. Participants were successful learners who received exemplary grades in an AP English class, were taught by the first author, and earned a passing score on an AP English exam. Participants' ages ranged from 21 to 33 years, and all were attending or had graduated from a four-year  or . Research Design: The young men participated in one-on-one, in-depth interviews. Interviews probed the participants' personal experiences in AP English, their perspectives in achieving success in the class and on the formal exam, and their recollections of the AP English curriculum, and were cross-analyzed for common sources of supports through multiple coding cycles. Findings: The young men highlighted six sources of support that were integral to their AP English success. They described three sources of social supports-the wisdom, guidance, and caring that they received from family members, English teachers, and peers-that promoted their success in AP English. In addition, participants identified three types of personal resources-their own  aspirations,  in learning academic literacies, and racial consciousness-that inspired and motivated their high scholastic achievement in AP English. Conclusion: By mobilizing the rich social supports and personal resources in their lives, African American male s have the resilience, courage, and the intelligence to enroll and succeed in AP English coursework. We suggest that suburban school administrators, school counselors, and teachers use open AP enrollment policies; work closely with and provide pertinent information to African American families; address s' social emotional concerns; and ensure that AP English pedagogical practices are humanizing to improve the recruitment and  of African American male s in AP English programs. Finally, we contend that al scholars and practitioners must continue to engage in research and practice that nurture young African American male s' social supports and personal resources for AP English success.",2021
"Wang, Xueli; Chuang, Yating; McCready, Bo",The Effect of Earning an Associate Degree on Community College Transfer s' Performance and Success at Four-Year Institutions,TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD,"Background/Context: As the cost of postsecondary  continues to rise, more s begin their postsecondary careers at a community  with the ultimate goal of upward transfer. However, there is limited evidence regarding how earning an associate degree prior to transfer shape transfer s' eventual success at baccalaureate . The existing literature on this topic either draws on data from single states or does not address self-selection. Purpose: In this study, we seek to understand whether transfer s' performance and attainment at 4-year  vary based on whether they achieved an associate degree prior to pursuing a baccalaureate degree. This study attempts to provide clearer evidence by using national data and robust quasi-experimental designs to investigate the effect of pretransfer associate degree attainment on posttransfer success. Research Design: We drew upon data from the Beginning Postsecondary s Longitudinal Study (BPS: 04/09) and its supplementary Postsecondary Education Transcript Study (PETS: 09) to answer our research question. To address self-selection, we employed two complementary quasi-experimental approaches in our study: propensity score matching (PSM) and instrumental variable (IV). The results were compared with baseline analyses using ordinary least squares (OLS) and probit regression. Findings: In the baseline analyses that did not deal with potential selection, we found that, compared to their counterparts who did not earn an associate degree prior to transfer, transfer s who had an associate degree showed no statistically significant differences in bachelor's degree attainment, , or GPA, but earned significantly fewer credits at 4-year . The results from the PSM are substantively similar to those from the baseline models. Using an IV approach, we found no impact of earning an associate degree on any of the aforementioned al outcomes at 4-year . Our study suggests that, based on a national dataset, s transferring upward to a 4-year institution from a community  are likely to have similar outcomes regardless of whether they earned an associate degree pretransfer. Conclusions: The uncovered null effect may not mean that earning an associate degree has no impact within specific state contexts; instead, it may mean that the impact varies across contexts, but aggregates to be null. Given that earning an associate degree at least does not hurt later transfer success, community s may wish to encourage pretransfer credential attainment as a way to better capture their success with these s and illustrate their contribution to the growing national effort to increase degree completion.",2017

"Sublett, Cameron; Gottfried, Michael A.",Individual and Institutional Factors of Applied STEM Coursetaking in High School,TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD,"Background/Context: One approach to address the shortage of STEM-proficient high school graduates has been the development of applied STEM coursework, which seeks to increase STEM interest and  by illustrating the interconnectedness and accessibility of STEM concepts. Importantly, however, no research has yet examined which  and institutional factors are associated with applied STEM coursetaking. Purpose//Research Question/Focus of the Study: The current study poses three questions: (a) What  factors are related to applied STEM coursetaking in high school? (b) What school factors are related to applied STEM coursetaking in high school? (c) How is the influence of these factors different based on the timing of course taken? Population/Participants/Subjects: This study uses data from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002. ELS: 2002 provides complete transcript data for similar to 90% of the s in the sample. Importantly, parent and teacher questionnaires were also gathered in the base year of the study. ELS: 2002, therefore, represents a rich, nationally representative multilevel dataset with complete  coursetaking records along with parent, teacher, and school administrator data. Research Design: This study relies on secondary data analyses and a series of logistic and multinomial logistic regression models. There were four key outcome variables, including: (a) a binary indicator of enrollment in at least one applied STEM course during high school, (b) a binary measure of whether a  had enrolled in at least one SRE-specific applied STEM course, (c) a binary measure of whether a  had enrolled in at least one IT-specific applied STEM course. To construct the fourth and final outcome variable, we divided applied STEM coursetaking into three categories: early, late, and never. Findings: The findings for the first research question suggested that women were significantly less likely to enroll in applied STEM courses. The findings for the second research question suggested that institutional factors were only weakly related to applied STEM enrollment. The findings for the third research question did not suggest major trends in when s enrolled in applied STEM. Rather, it appears that s enroll in applied STEM courses throughout high school. Conclusions/Recommendations: This study illustrated that rather than increasing the number of traditionally underrepresented  groups in STEM, applied STEM courses may be contributing to the much-discussed gender gap in STEM . Policymakers and school leaders must examine the mechanisms behind this stratification; future research should explore, perhaps through qualitative inquiry, why women and s with disabilities choose to not take these courses.",2017

Practical implications of these findings include the consideration of romantic relationships among the undergraduate  body by  administrators and faculty when attempting to address course attendance concerns. Additionally, this study suggests that future researchers examine the characteristics of romantic relationships and romantic partners in order to more fully understand how such relationships might affect the academic performance of  s.",2017

For certain groups of s, the risk of these poor outcomes is elevated. In this study, 348 s from a large residential  in the western United States were surveyed to understand the role of psychological flexibility and inflexibility on self-efficacy and the potential moderating impact of year in  and underrepresented racial minority (URM) status. Results indicated that s who are psychologically flexible reported greater  self-efficacy, whereas s who are psychologically inflexible reported lower  self-efficacy. The impact of psychological inflexibility on self-efficacy was moderated by URM status and year in school; psychological inflexibility had a stronger impact on URM s' self-efficacy than nonminority s, and psychological inflexibility had a greater effect on  s starting  as opposed to s who had been enrolled for multiple years.",2020
"Asikainen, Henna; Blomster, Jaanika; Virtanen, Viivi",From functioning communality to hostile behaviour: students' and teachers' experiences of the teacher-student relationship in the academic community,JOURNAL OF FURTHER AND HIGHER EDUCATION,"Teacher support is an important factor affecting academic and social integration into the . However, studies have been very scarce concerning both s' and teachers' experiences of their relationship in  . The purpose of this study is to examine s' and teachers' experiences of communality and interaction as well as the support given by teachers in the academic community. A total of 68 teachers and 104 s participated in this study by answering both Likert-scale and an open-ended question. The results show wide variation in both s' and teachers' experiences. The experiences varied from descriptions of a good and functional communality to a gap between teachers and s or even hostile behaviour towards s. Five main categories emerged from the data: (1) functioning interaction and communality, (2) good quality contacts between s and teachers, (3) variable experiences of interaction and communality, (4) low quality interaction and communality, and (5) dysfunctional contacts between s and teachers. The results indicate that teachers experience the support given to s more positively than the s. In addition, the results concerning the open-ended question also indicated that teachers experience the communality and interaction between teachers and s more positively than the s. More attention should be given to the teacher- relationship at the   level. In addition, general skills such as ability to interact with others and social behaviour should be emphasised to a greater degree when recruiting staff.",2018
"Olivera-Aguilar, Margarita; Rikoon, Samuel H.; Robbins, Steven B.",Using Latent Profile Analysis to Identify Noncognitive Skill Profiles Among College s,JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION,"Most research examining the relationship between noncognitive variables and academic performance has tended to focus on developing linear prediction models. However, a more holistic understanding of academic success can be achieved by examining the noncognitive profiles of s and their relationship with academic outcomes. In the present study, we used latent profile analysis to explore the noncognitive profiles of 5,120  s. To better understand the nature of the profiles, the effect of covariates on class membership was examined. Results indicated that there were 6 latent profiles underlying the noncognitive skills of  s in our sample and that profile membership was associated with different collegiate grade point average levels. Our results have practical implications for the development of interventions intended to improve academic performance, which may be customized toward the specific needs of s presenting with diverse profiles.",2017

Howeyer, its official and academic use entails pitfalls, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Based on evidence from Eduardo Mondlane University in Mozambique, this paper contributes to the academic and policy debate on graduation rates in SSA, by using logistic regression analysis to measure and explain this indicator. The paper's findings are twofold: (i) graduation rates at UEM (and eventually in SSA) may be different from what their misleading measurement and usage may portray; (ii) graduation rates are particularly affected by the academic aspects of s and the institution. The paper claims that rigor is needed to produce data (e.g. graduation rates) on African universities to strategically inform decision making. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2017
"Ovink, Sarah M.; Veazey, Brian D.",More Than Getting Us Through: A Case Study in Cultural Capital Enrichment of Underrepresented Minority Undergraduates,RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION,"Minority s continue to be underrepresented among those who seek graduate and professional degrees in the sciences. Much previous research has focused on academic preparation. Equally important, however, are the psychological-social barriers and lack of institutional support encountered by many minority s. We present a case study of a -sponsored intervention program for minority science majors that addresses not only academics, but also socialization into the academic community, networking, and the ability to practice newfound skills and dispositions through undergraduate research. In examining this case, we suggest that concerted, formal efforts toward expanding habitus and thereby augmenting cultural and social capital may have positive effects for underrepresented minority (URM)  s' academic and career prospects. Moreover, we argue that these differences complement the gains program participants make in academic preparedness, showing that attention to academics alone may be insufficient for addressing longstanding inequities in science career attainment among URM s.",2011

The first study was conducted with a low-risk francophone population (N = 298) and indicated that the Test of Reactions and Adaptation in College (TRAC: nonintellectual dispositions) predicts the  success of first-year s above and beyond that predicted by the high school rank (academic dispositions) and a French-language measure of aptitude (intellectual dispositions). The latter measure added no additional variation to the high school rank in predicting success. These results were replicated in a second study conducted with an American  population who were academically at risk (N =179); and using the Scholastic Aptitude Test as a measure of intellectual dispositions.

"Abdous, M'hammed",Influence of satisfaction and preparedness on online students' feelings of anxiety,INTERNET AND HIGHER EDUCATION,"As they transition from a face-to-face to an online learning environment, online s are likely to feel anxious about their ability to succeed in what could be an unfamiliar learning environment. To ease this transition, online learning orientations are intended to defuse s' feelings of anxiety by clarifying course expectations and requirements while boosting their self-confidence and preparedness. This study examined how various factors associated with the online learning experience - s' demographics, prior online learning experience, satisfaction, and sense of preparedness for the course after completing an online learning orientation - influence online s' feelings of anxiety. Using a binary logistic regression, our findings confirmed that demographics (i.e., female, full-time, first year online ), prior online learning experience, and sense of preparedness predicted online s' feelings of anxiety.  age and  satisfaction were less conclusive. Overall, our study reiterates the need to address factors associated with online s' feelings of anxiety, in order to boost their confidence, motivation, and preparedness to succeed in online courses.",2019

"Wang, Xueli; Wickersham, Kelly; Lee, Yen; Chan, Hsun-Yu",Exploring Sources and Influences of Social Capital on Community College s' First-Year Success: Does Age Make a Difference?,TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD,"Background/Context: Although numerous studies have emerged shedding light on community   success, the enduring role of social capital is often overlooked. Furthermore, when conceptualizing social capital in the community  context and its diverse  population, age represents a unique form of diversity in these  that warrants further exploration. Purpose: This research identifies the sources of social capital and the relationships between different sources of social capital and community  success, taking into account how the identified sources and relationships may vary based on age through the following questions: First, what are the major sources of social capital among first-year community  s, and how do sources of social capital vary based on age of s? Second, how do different sources of social capital influence first-year community  success? Third, how do influences of social capital on first-year community  success vary based on the age of s? Research Design: Our study drew on Coleman's conceptualization of social capital, along with survey, administrative, and transcript data from three 2-year s in a midwestern state. We performed factor analysis with invariance tests to investigate the sources of social capital among community  s and how the identified factor structure may vary by age. We further conducted a logistic regression to examine the relationship between social capital and community   success across age. Findings: Our findings indicate that social capital needs to be conceptualized differently for community  s across age because they indeed drew on multiple forms of social capital differently, and the sources of social capital that emerged in turn were related to  success in varied ways. s under the age of 24 relied on institutional agents and academic interaction as dominant forms of social capital, whereas those over the age of 24 relied on significant other's support. s under the age of 24 were more likely to succeed if they frequently visited advisors for academic reasons. A low or high level of support for schoolwork was related to a  chance of success for s between 24 and 29 years of age. For the s who were over 30 years old, a moderate level of engagement in their learning network and discussions with academic advisors was related to the lowest level of dropping out. Conclusions: This study extends the social capital model by illuminating the varying types of social capital that s of different age groups engage with, particularly in the community  context, and pushes the boundaries of the knowledge base on how social capital functions in relation to  success in postsecondary . The findings also elucidate new directions for research, policy, and practice in regard to cultivating and maximizing networks and information for community  s of all ages.",2018

"Franke, Ray","Take It, or Leave It? Analyzing How Unsubsidized Federal Loans Affect Six-Year Degree Attainment Across Income Groups",JOURNAL OF STUDENT FINANCIAL AID,"This study examined the effects of unsubsidized federal Stafford loans on six-year degree attainment at 4-year s and universities in the U.S., and how these differentially impact s across income groups. For this, nationally representative data from the Beginning Postsecondary s (BPS:04/09) and the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) was merged to analyze N=6,561 s attending n=651 four-year . To account for possible selection bias in loan borrowing and the nested data structure, this study employs a propensity score matching, multilevel modeling approach. In addition to financial aid measures, the analytic model draws from the heterogeneous research approach and incorporates s'  experiences and institutional context to estimate effects. Results reveal a comparatively large, negative association with the outcome measure for low-income s. For every $1,000 borrowed additionally in unsubsidized loans, low-income s are found to be 5.45% (p<000) less likely to graduate within six years. Beyond that, results show no significant effect for other income groups. Findings provide further support for the need to monitor  borrowing behavior, creating a more targeted approach to  aid that minimizes the use of unsubsidized loans for low-income s, and more closely examining differential effects of aid types across various  groups.",2019

Based on a sample of 3,888 online s from an urban public , we used ordinal logistic regression to understand the influence of s' satisfaction with an online learning orientation (OLO), their prior level of online learning experience, and their demographics on their academic self-efficacy (ASE). Consistent with prior research, our findings confirmed the influence of s' satisfaction with OLO, their prior online learning experience, and their gender on their ASE. Unsatisfied s were 85% less likely than satisfied s to express a high level of self-efficacy. In contrast, s' age and enrollment status proved not to be significant. Overall, our findings provide strong evidence about how the use of an OLO as proactive support strategy can boost online s' academic self-efficacy.",2019
