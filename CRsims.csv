Virtual patient simulation: Promotion of clinical reasoning abilities of medical students,KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT & E-LEARNING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL,"Objectives: Virtual patient simulation (VPS) is used in the education of health care professionals. This method brings an opportunity for the learner to examine necessary diagnostic and therapeutic skills. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of VPS on clinical reasoning abilities of medical students and to evaluate their attitude towards VPS in clinical endocrinology course in a teacher centered educational environment. Methods: Fifty-one medical students in their 6th academic year were simply randomized in two groups, the simulation and the control. The students in the simulation group were provided by an application which presented them virtual case scenarios on diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and osteomalacia. All the students sat for a diagnostic test at the beginning and at the end of the course. The test comprised a series of essay questions matched for their academic level and closely related to the case scenarios. They were also asked to complete a questionnaire to assess their attitude towards the application. Results: Participants in both groups did not have any statistical differences in scientific background in basic sciences (P=0.672) and prior clinical examinations (P=0.376). At completion of the course the mean score of the students in the simulation group improved significantly compared to the students in the control group by 3.5 vs. 1.0 points (P=0.001). The students found the application worthful and showed a positive attitude towards it. Conclusions: Virtual patient simulation improved clinical reasoning abilities of medical students in the context of a traditional teaching/learning environment."
The Utility of Virtual Patient Simulations for Clinical Reasoning Education,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,"Virtual Patient Simulations (VPSs) have been cited as a novel learning strategy, but there is little evidence that VPSs yield improvements in clinical reasoning skills and medical knowledge. This study aimed to clarify the effectiveness of VPSs for improving clinical reasoning skills among medical students, and to compare improvements in knowledge or clinical reasoning skills relevant to specific clinical scenarios. We enrolled 210 fourth-year medical students in March 2017 and March 2018 to participate in a real-time pre-post experimental design conducted in a large lecture hall by using a clicker. A VPS program ((R)Body Interact, Portugal) was implemented for one two-hour class session using the same methodology during both years. A pre-post 20-item multiple-choice questionnaire (10 knowledge and 10 clinical reasoning items) was used to evaluate learning outcomes. A total of 169 students completed the program. Participants showed significant increases in average total post-test scores, both on knowledge items (pre-test: median = 5, mean = 4.78, 95% CI (4.55-5.01); post-test: median = 5, mean = 5.12, 95% CI (4.90-5.43);p-value = 0.003) and clinical reasoning items (pre-test: median = 5, mean = 5.3 95%, CI (4.98-5.58); post-test: median = 8, mean = 7.81, 95% CI (7.57-8.05);p-value < 0.001). Thus, VPS programs could help medical students improve their clinical decision-making skills without lecturer supervision."
Assessing clinical reasoning in undergraduate medical students during history taking with an empirically derived scale for clinical reasoning indicators,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background The clinical reasoning process, which requires biomedical knowledge, knowledge about problem-solving strategies, and knowledge about reasons for diagnostic procedures, is a key element of physicians' daily practice but difficult to assess. The aim of this study was to empirically develop a Clinical Reasoning Indicators-History Taking-Scale (CRI-HT-S) and to assess the clinical reasoning ability of advanced medical students during a simulation involving history taking. Methods The Clinical Reasoning Indictors-History Taking-Scale (CRI-HT-S) including a 5-point Likert scale for assessment was designed from clinical reasoning indicators identified in a qualitative study in 2017. To assess indicators of clinical reasoning ability, 65 advanced medical students (semester 10, n = 25 versus final year, n = 40) from three medical schools participated in a 360-degree competence assessment in the role of beginning residents during a simulated first workday in hospital. This assessment included a consultation hour with five simulated patients which was videotaped. Videos of 325 patient consultations were assessed using the CRI-HT-S. A factor analysis was conducted and the students' results were compared according to their advancement in undergraduate medical training. Results The clinical reasoning indicators of the CRI-HT-S loaded on three factors relevant for clinical reasoning: 1) focusing questions, 2) creating context, and 3) securing information. Students reached significantly different scores (p < .001) for the three factors (factor 1: 4.07 +/- .47, factor 2: 3.72 +/- .43, factor 3: 2.79 +/- .83). Students in semester 10 reached significantly lower scores for factor 3 than students in their final year (p < .05). Conclusions The newly developed CRI-HT-S worked well for quantitative assessment of clinical reasoning indicators during history taking. Its three-factored structure helped to explore different aspects of clinical reasoning. Whether the CRI-HT-S has the potential to be used as a scale in objective structured clinical examinations (OCSEs) or in workplace-based assessments of clinical reasoning has to be investigated in further studies with larger student cohorts."
Online patient simulation training to improve clinical reasoning: a feasibility randomised controlled trial,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background Online patient simulations (OPS) are a novel method for teaching clinical reasoning skills to students and could contribute to reducing diagnostic errors. However, little is known about how best to implement and evaluate OPS in medical curricula. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility, acceptability and potential effects of eCREST - the electronic Clinical Reasoning Educational Simulation Tool. Methods A feasibility randomised controlled trial was conducted with final year undergraduate students from three UK medical schools in academic year 2016/2017 (cohort one) and 2017/2018 (cohort two). Student volunteers were recruited in cohort one via email and on teaching days, and in cohort two eCREST was also integrated into a relevant module in the curriculum. The intervention group received three patient cases and the control group received teaching as usual; allocation ratio was 1:1. Researchers were blind to allocation. Clinical reasoning skills were measured using a survey after 1 week and a patient case after 1 month. Results Across schools, 264 students participated (18.2% of all eligible). Cohort two had greater uptake (183/833, 22%) than cohort one (81/621, 13%). After 1 week, 99/137 (72%) of the intervention and 86/127 (68%) of the control group remained in the study. eCREST improved students' ability to gather essential information from patients over controls (OR = 1.4; 95% CI 1.1-1.7,n = 148). Of the intervention group, most (80/98, 82%) agreed eCREST helped them to learn clinical reasoning skills. Conclusions eCREST was highly acceptable and improved data gathering skills that could reduce diagnostic errors. Uptake was low but improved when integrated into course delivery. A summative trial is needed to estimate effectiveness."
Case-Based Teaching: Does the Addition of High-Fidelity Simulation Make a Difference in Medical Students' Clinical Reasoning Skills?,MEDICAL SCIENCE EDUCATOR,"ContextSituativity theory posits that learning and the development of clinical reasoning skills are grounded in context. In case-based teaching, this context comes from recreating the clinical environment, through emulation, as with manikins, or description. In this study, we sought to understand the difference in student clinical reasoning abilities after facilitated patient case scenarios with or without a manikin.MethodsFourth-year medical students in an internship readiness course were randomized into patient case scenarios without manikin (control group) and with manikin (intervention group) for a chest pain session. The control and intervention groups had identical student-led case progression and faculty debriefing objectives. Clinical reasoning skills were assessed after the session using a 64-question script concordance test (SCT). The test was developed and piloted prior to administration. Hospitalist and emergency medicine faculty responses on the test items served as the expert standard for scoring.ResultsNinety-six students were randomized to case-based sessions with (n=48) or without (n=48) manikin. Ninety students completed the SCT (with manikin n=45, without manikin n=45). A statistically significant mean difference on test performance between the two groups was found (t=3.059, df=88, p=.003), with the manikin group achieving higher SCT scores.ConclusionUse of a manikin in simulated patient case discussion significantly improves students' clinical reasoning skills, as measured by SCT. These results suggest that using a manikin to simulate a patient scenario situates learning, thereby enhancing skill development."
Teaching diagnostic reasoning: using simulation and mixed practice to build competence,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE,"The acquisition of competence in diagnostic reasoning is essential for medical trainees. Exposure to a variety of patient presentations helps develop the skills of diagnostic reasoning, but reliance on ad hoc clinical encounters is inefficient and does not guarantee timely exposure for all trainees. We present a novel teaching series led by emergency physicians that builds upon the existing medical education literature to teach diagnostic reasoning to preclinical (2nd year) medical students. The series used emergency department simulations involving patient actors and simulated vital signs to provide students with exposure to three acute care presentations: chest pain, abdominal pain, and headache. Emergency physicians coached and provided immediate feedback to the students as they actively worked through diagnostic reasoning. The participating medical students reported benefit from these sessions immediately following the sessions and in an 18-month follow-up survey where the students could consider the impact of the sessions on their clinical clerkship. Students felt that the sessions had assisted them in recognizing the key features of relevant diagnoses during clerkship as well as providing a helpful adjunct to their in-class learning."
Utilization of the Nursing Process to Foster Clinical Reasoning During a Simulation Experience,SAGE OPEN,"Nursing practice includes complex reasoning and multifaceted decision making with minimal standardized guidance in how to evaluate this phenomenon among nursing students. Learning outcomes related to the clinical reasoning process among novice baccalaureate nursing students during a simulation experience were evaluated. Nursing process records were utilized to evaluate and foster the development of clinical reasoning in a high-fidelity medical-surgical simulation experience. Students were unable to describe and process pertinent patient information appropriately prior to the simulation experience. Students' ability to identify pertinent patient cues and plan appropriate patient care improved following the simulation. The learning activity afforded a structured opportunity to identify cues, prioritize the proper course of nursing interventions, and engage in collaboration among peers. The simulation experience provides faculty insight into the students' clinical reasoning processes, while providing students with a clear framework for successfully accomplishing learning outcomes."
The Use of Contextualized Standardized Client Simulation to Develop Clinical Reasoning in Final-Year Veterinary Students,JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Clinical reasoning is an important skill for veterinary students to develop before graduation. Simulation has been studied in medical education as a method for developing clinical reasoning in students, but evidence supporting it is limited. This study involved the creation of a contextualized, standardized client simulation session that aimed to improve the clinical reasoning ability and confidence of final-year veterinary students. Sixty-eight participants completed three simulated primary-care consultations, with the client played by an actor and the pet by a healthy animal. Survey data showed that all participants felt that the session improved their clinical decision-making ability. Quantitative clinical reasoning self-assessment, performed using a validated rubric, triangulated this finding, showing an improvement in students' perception of several components of their clinical reasoning skill level from before the simulation to after it. Blinded researcher analysis of the consultation video recordings found that students showed a significant increase in ability on the history-taking and making-sense-of-data (including formation of a differential diagnosis) components of the assessment rubric. Thirty students took part in focus groups investigating their experience with the simulation. Two themes arose from thematic analysis of these data: variety of reasoning methods and It's a different way of thinking. The latter highlights differences between the decision making students practice during their time in education and the decision making they will use once they are in practice. Our findings suggest that simulation can be used to develop clinical reasoning in veterinary students, and they demonstrate the need for further research in this area."
Development of simulation education debriefing protocol with faculty guide for enhancement clinical reasoning,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,"BackgroundThe clinical environments are more complex, diverse and rapidly changing. Patients' conditions were chronic and complexed, healthcare providers require clinical reasoning for patient safety care. One of the learning methods to foster clinical reasoning is simulation education. The aim of this study was to develop a simulation education debriefing protocol that can improve clinical reasoning.MethodsThis study was conducted following steps. For the first step, the literature review was performed to constitute a preliminary debriefing protocol. Secondly, content validity was evaluated by five simulation learning experts. Thirdly, in-depth interview was conducted to re-examine content validity with education experts. Finally, the final debriefing protocol was applied to 7 undergraduate nursing students to examine feasibility of the protocol.ResultsThe protocol consisted of debriefing steps, learning outcome, clinical reasoning attributes, core questions and guideline for instructor. Results of applicability of debriefing protocol represented that participants mentioned their reasoning competency was improved and understood the overall flow of reasoning.ConclusionsThe debriefing protocol is important to educate healthcare providers clinical reasoning. It would be able to contribute to develop healthcare providers' clinical competencies."
Integrated Case Learning: teaching clinical reasoning,ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION,"Learning how to 'think like doctors' can be difficult for undergraduate medical students in their early clinical years. Our model of collaborative Integrated Case Learning (ICL) and simulated clinical reasoning aims to address these issues. Taking a socio-cultural perspective, this study investigates the reflective learning interactions and practices of clinical thinking that emerged in the ICL environment. We also explore how third year medical students perceived their ICL experiences in relation to the clinical situations encountered in the hospital setting. The context for the inquiry is a rural Clinical School in North West Victoria, Australia. We used a qualitative case study methodology following eight third-year medical students over an academic year. Individual and group interviews were conducted, together with observations and document/artefact analysis. Data was analysed using content and narrative methods. The ICL program was well received. Findings suggest that the group-based, simulated clinical reasoning process appears to help undergraduate medical students to rehearse, articulate and question their clinical decision-making pathways. We argue that the ICL process offers a professionally challenging, but supportive group learning 'space' for students to practise what it might mean to 'think', 'talk' and 'perform' like doctors in real settings. The ICL environment also appears to create a connective bridge between the 'classroom' and clinical practice."
Exploring a New Simulation Approach to Improve Clinical Reasoning Teaching and Assessment: Randomized Trial Protocol,JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS,"Background: Helping trainees develop appropriate clinical reasoning abilities is a challenging goal in an environment where clinical situations are marked by high levels of complexity and unpredictability. The benefit of simulation-based education to assess clinical reasoning skills has rarely been reported. More specifically, it is unclear if clinical reasoning is better acquired if the instructor's input occurs entirely after or is integrated during the scenario. Based on educational principles of the dual-process theory of clinical reasoning, a new simulation approach called simulation with iterative discussions (SID) is introduced. The instructor interrupts the flow of the scenario at three key moments of the reasoning process (data gathering, integration, and confirmation). After each stop, the scenario is continued where it was interrupted. Finally, a brief general debriefing ends the session. System-1 process of clinical reasoning is assessed by verbalization during management of the case, and System-2 during the iterative discussions without providing feedback. Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Simulation with Iterative Discussions versus the classical approach of simulation in developing reasoning skills of General Pediatrics and Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine residents. Methods: This will be a prospective exploratory, randomized study conducted at Sainte-Justine hospital in Montreal, Qc, between January and March 2016. All post-graduate year (PGY) 1 to 6 residents will be invited to complete one SID or classical simulation 30 minutes audio video-recorded complex high-fidelity simulations covering a similar neonatology topic. Pre- and post-simulation questionnaires will be completed and a semistructured interview will be conducted after each simulation. Data analyses will use SPSS and NVivo softwares. Results: This study is in its preliminary stages and the results are expected to be made available by April, 2016. Conclusions: This will be the first study to explore a new simulation approach designed to enhance clinical reasoning. By assessing more closely reasoning processes throughout a simulation session, we believe that Simulation with Iterative Discussions will be an interesting and more effective approach for students. The findings of the study will benefit medical educators, education programs, and medical students."
Development and psychometric testing of a Clinical Reasoning Evaluation Simulation Tool (CREST) for assessing nursing students' abilities to recognize and respond to clinical deterioration,NURSE EDUCATION TODAY,"Bacicground: The development of clinical reasoning skills in recognising and responding to clinical deterioration is essential in pre-registration nursing education. Simulation has been increasingly used by educators to develop this skill. Objective: To develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of a Clinical Reasoning Evaluation Simulation Tool (CREST) for measuring clinical reasoning skills in recognising and responding to clinical deterioration in a simulated environment. Design A scale development with psychometric testing and mixed methods study. Participants/Settings: Nursing students and academic staff were recruited at a university. Method: A three-phase prospective study was conducted. Phase 1 involved the development and content validation of the CREST; Phase 2 included the psychometric testing of the tool with 15 second-year and 15 third-year nursing students who undertook the simulation-based assessment; Phase 3 involved the usability testing of the tool with nine academic staff through a survey questionnaire and focus group discussion. Results: A 10-item CREST was developed based on a model of clinical reasoning. A content validity of 0.93 was obtained from the validation of 15 international experts. The construct validity was supported as the third-year students demonstrated significantly higher (p < 0.001) clinical reasoning scores than the second-year students. The concurrent validity was also supported with significant positive correlations between global rating scores and almost all subscale scores, and the total scores. The predictive validity was supported with an existing tool. The internal consistency was high with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.92. A high inter-rater reliability was demonstrated with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.88. The usability of the tool was rated positively by the nurse educators but the need to ease the scoring process was highlighted. Conclusions: A valid and reliable tool was developed to measure the effectiveness of simulation in developing clinical reasoning skills for recognising and responding to clinical deterioration."
The Effects of Computer-Based Simulation Game and Virtual Reality Simulation in Nursing Students' Self-evaluated Clinical Reasoning Skills,CIN-COMPUTERS INFORMATICS NURSING,"Research has shown that nursing students can learn clinical reasoning skills by engaging in simulation games. However, there has been no research regarding the effects of simulation games on clinical reasoning skills when nursing students also engage in virtual reality simulations. Furthermore, by engaging in simulation games, neither game metrics nor their impact on students' self-evaluated clinical reasoning skills has been studied. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of these two kinds of simulation games using a one-group pretest-posttest design. Forty nursing students self-evaluated their clinical reasoning skills in three phases using the Clinical Reasoning Skills scale. Furthermore, the game metrics of the simulation games were analyzed, and the results clearly showed that students' self-evaluated clinical reasoning skills were systematically improved. There was a systematic association between better playing scores and better self-evaluated clinical reasoning skills in playing both kinds of simulation games. Moreover, students engaged more time in the virtual reality simulation than the computer-based simulation game. Overall, the results suggest that the use of a combination of both kinds of simulation games is an effective way for nursing students to learn clinical reasoning skills."
Using Virtual Patients to Explore the Clinical Reasoning Skills of Medical Students: Mixed Methods Study,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,"Background: Improving clinical reasoning skills-the thought processes used by clinicians to formulate appropriate questions and diagnoses-is essential for reducing missed diagnostic opportunities. The electronic Clinical Reasoning Educational Simulation Tool (eCREST) was developed to improve the clinical reasoning of future physicians. A feasibility trial demonstrated acceptability and potential impacts; however, the processes by which students gathered data were unknown. Objective: This study aims to identify the data gathering patterns of final year medical students while using eCREST and how eCREST influences the patterns. Methods: A mixed methods design was used. A trial of eCREST across 3 UK medical schools (N=148) measured the potential effects of eCREST on data gathering. A qualitative think-aloud and semistructured interview study with 16 medical students from one medical school identified 3 data gathering strategies: Thorough, Focused, and Succinct. Some had no strategy. Reanalysis of the trial data identified the prevalence of data gathering patterns and compared patterns between the intervention and control groups. Patterns were identified based on 2 variables that were measured in a patient case 1 month after the intervention: the proportion of Essential information students identified and the proportion of irrelevant information gathered (Relevant). Those who scored in the top 3 quartiles for Essential but in the lowest quartile for Relevant displayed a Thorough pattern. Those who scored in the top 3 quartiles for Relevant but in the lowest quartile for Essential displayed a Succinct pattern. Those who scored in the top 3 quartiles on both variables displayed a Focused pattern. Those whose scores were in the lowest quartile on both variables displayed a Nonspecific pattern. Results: The trial results indicated that students in the intervention group were more thorough than those in the control groups when gathering data. The qualitative data identified data gathering strategies and the mechanisms by which eCREST influenced data gathering. Students reported that eCREST promoted thoroughness by prompting them to continuously reflect and allowing them to practice managing uncertainty. However, some found eCREST to be less useful, and they randomly gathered information. Reanalysis of the trial data revealed that the intervention group was significantly more likely to display a Thorough data gathering pattern than controls (21/78, 27% vs 6/70, 9%) and less likely to display a Succinct pattern (13/78, 17% vs 20/70, 29%; chi(2)(3)=9.9; P=.02). Other patterns were similar across groups. Conclusions: Qualitative data suggested that students applied a range of data gathering strategies while using eCREST and that eCREST encouraged thoroughness by continuously prompting the students to reflect and manage their uncertainty. Trial data suggested that eCREST led students to demonstrate more Thorough data gathering patterns. Virtual patients that encourage thoroughness could help future physicians avoid missed diagnostic opportunities and enhance the delivery of clinical reasoning teaching."
Effect of Paper- and Computer-based Simulated Instructions on Clinical Reasoning Skills of Undergraduate Medical Students: A Randomized Control Trial,CUREUS,"Background and objectives Skilled clinical reasoning is a critical tool for physicians. Educators agree that this skill should be formally taught and assessed. Objectives related to the mastery of clinical reasoning skills appear in the documentation of most medical schools and licensing bodies. We conducted this study to assess the differences in clinical reasoning skills in medical students following paper-and computer-based simulated instructions. Materials and methods A total of 52 sixth semester medical students of the Dow University of Health Sciences were included in this study. A tutorial was delivered to all students on clinical reasoning and its importance in clinical practice. Students were divided randomly into two groups: group A received paper-based instructions while group B received computer-based instructions (as Flash-based scenarios developed with Articulate Storyline software [https://articulate.com/p/storyline-3]) focused on clinical reasoning skills in history-taking of acute and chronic upper abdominal pain. After one week, both groups were tested at two objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) stations to assess acute and chronic pain history-taking skills in relation to clinical reasoning. Results There were 27 students in group A and 25 students in group B. The mean OSCE score for group A (paper-based) was 28.6 +/- 9.4 and that for group B (computer-based) was 38.5 +/- 6.0. Group B's mean score was statistically significantly greater (p < 0.001) than group A's mean score for clinical reasoning skills. Conclusion A computer simulation program can enhance clinical reasoning skills. This technology could be used to acquaint students with real-life experiences and identify potential areas for more training before facing real patients."
Do medical students' scores using different assessment instruments predict their scores in clinical reasoning using a computer-based simulation?,ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND PRACTICE,"Purpose: The development of clinical problem-solving skills evolves over time and requires structured training and background knowledge. Computer-based case simulations (CCS) have been used for teaching and assessment of clinical reasoning skills. However, previous studies examining the psychometric properties of CCS as an assessment tool have been controversial. Furthermore, studies reporting the integration of CCS into problem-based medical curricula have been limited. Methods: This study examined the psychometric properties of using CCS software (DxR Clinician) for assessment of medical students (n=130) studying in a problem-based, integrated multisystem module (Unit IX) during the academic year 2011-2012. Internal consistency reliability of CCS scores was calculated using Cronbach's alpha statistics. The relationships between students' scores in CCS components (clinical reasoning, diagnostic performance, and patient management) and their scores in other examination tools at the end of the unit including multiple-choice questions, short-answer questions, objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), and real patient encounters were analyzed using stepwise hierarchical linear regression. Results: Internal consistency reliability of CCS scores was high (alpha=0.862). Inter-item correlations between students' scores in different CCS components and their scores in CCS and other test items were statistically significant. Regression analysis indicated that OSCE scores predicted 32.7% and 35.1% of the variance in clinical reasoning and patient management scores, respectively (P < 0.01). Multiple-choice question scores, however, predicted only 15.4% of the variance in diagnostic performance scores (P < 0.01), while students' scores in real patient encounters did not predict any of the CCS scores. Conclusion: Students' scores in OSCE are the most important predictors of their scores in clinical reasoning and patient management using CCS. However, real patient encounter assessment does not appear to test a construct similar to what is tested in CCS."
The impact of simulation-based triage education on nursing students' self-reported clinical reasoning ability: A quasi-experimental study,NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE,"Few studies have comprehensively examined the effectiveness of simulation-based triage education on clinical reasoning of nursing students. This study evaluated the impact of a simulation-based triage exercise on nursing students' self-reported clinical reasoning ability. Three cohorts of third-year nursing students were divided into intervention group a (IG a, n = 62), intervention group b (IG b, n = 57), and a control group (CG, n = 53). Students in IG a and IG b participated in a simulation-based triage education consisting of 2 h of multiple patient triage simulations and an hour of structured debriefing. The CG participated in a traditional didactic triage course consisting of a 3-h lecture. Self-reported clinical reasoning ability in pre and post-triage education was measured by the Nurses Clinical Reasoning Scale. There was no significant difference in mean clinical reasoning ability scores between the three groups in pre-test (p > 0.05). Clinical reasoning ability scores in post-test among students in IG a and IG b were significantly higher than those in CG (p < 0.001). Nursing students exposed to a simulation-based triage education had more improvement in self-reported clinical reasoning ability as compared with students who participated in a lecture-based triage education program."
Medical Students' Clinical Reasoning During a Simulated Viral Pandemic: Evidence of Cognitive Integration and Insights on Novices' Approach to Diagnostic Reasoning,MEDICAL SCIENCE EDUCATOR,"IntroductionCognitive integration from multiple disciplines is essential to clinical problem-solving. Because it is not directly observable, demonstrating evidence of learners' cognitive integration remains a challenge. In addition, little is known about preclinical medical students' approach to diagnostic reasoning despite widespread implementation of clinical reasoning curricula for these early learners. The objectives of this study were to characterize how first-year medical students integrated knowledge to problem-solve during a simulated viral pandemic and to characterize students' diagnostic reasoning approach to this clinical scenario.Materials and MethodsStudent teams analyzed clinical data to formulate hypotheses for the pandemic's source and submitted reports justifying their hypotheses and treatment recommendations. A content analysis on students' reports identified codes and themes characterizing the learning content integrated and students' approaches to diagnostic reasoning tasks.ResultsSixteen problem-solving codes were identified, demonstrating integration of new and previously encountered content from multiple disciplines. A compare-contrast analytical approach was the most commonly employed diagnostic reasoning approach (100%), with a smaller subset of teams also using a causal approach (20%).DiscussionContent analysis of preclinical students' diagnostic justification tasks provided insights into their approach to diagnostic reasoning, which was most consistent with the search-inference framework rather than a causal approach, likely due to limited pathophysiological knowledge at that point in training.ConclusionsEvidence of cognitive integration can be made explicit through learners' narrative justification of diagnostic reasoning tasks. Preclinical students' diagnostic reasoning development has implications for curricular design and implementation for this learner group."
A Bayesian perspective on constructing a written assessment of probabilistic clinical reasoning in experienced clinicians,JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE,"RationaleDecision-making performance assessments have proven problematic for assessing clinical reasoning. Aims and ObjectivesA Bayesian approach to designing an advanced clinical reasoning assessment is well grounded in mathematical and cognitive theory and may offer significant psychometric advantages. Probabilistic logic plays an important role in medical problem solving, and performances on Bayesian-type tasks appear to be causally-related to the ability to make sound clinical decisions. MethodsA validity argument is used to guide the design of an assessment of medical reasoning using clinical probabilities. Results/ConclusionsThe practical advantage of using a Bayesian approach to item design relates to the fact that probability theory provides a rationally optimal method for managing uncertain information and provides the criteria for objective correct answer scoring. Potential item formats are discussed."
Clinical reasoning of nursing students on clinical placement: Clinical educators' perceptions,NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE,"Graduate nurses may have knowledge and adequate clinical psychomotor skills however they have been identified as lacking the clinical reasoning skills to deliver safe, effective care suggesting contemporary educational approaches do not always facilitate the development of nursing students' clinical reasoning. While nursing literature explicates the concept of clinical reasoning and develops models that demonstrate clinical reasoning, there is very little published about nursing students and clinical reasoning during clinical placements. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten clinical educators to gain an understanding of how they recognised, developed and appraised nursing students' clinical reasoning while on clinical placement. This study found variability in the clinical educators' conceptualisation, recognition, and facilitation of students' clinical reasoning. Although most of the clinical educators conceptualised clinical reasoning as a process those who did not demonstrated the greatest variability in the recognition and facilitation of students' clinical reasoning. The clinical educators in this study also described being unable to adequately appraise a student's clinical reasoning during clinical placement with the use of the current performance assessment tool.

First-year medical students' calibration bias and accuracy across clinical reasoning activities,ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION,"To be safe and effective practitioners and learners, medical professionals must be able to accurately assess their own performance to know when they need additional help. This study explored the metacognitive judgments of 157 first-year medical students; in particular, the study examined students' self-assessments or calibration as they engaged in a virtual-patient simulation targeting clinical reasoning practices. Examining two key subtasks of a patient encounter, history (Hx) and physical exam (PE), the authors assessed the level of variation in students' behavioral performance (i.e., effectiveness and efficiency) and judgments of performance (i.e., calibration bias and accuracy) across the two subtasks. Paired t tests revealed that the Hx subtask was deemed to be more challenging than the PE subtask when viewed in terms of both actual and perceived performance. In addition to students performing worse on the Hx subtask than PE, they also perceived that they performed less well for Hx. Interestingly, across both subtasks, the majority of participants overestimated their performance (98% of participants for Hx and 95% for PE). Correlation analyses revealed that the participants' overall level of accuracy in metacognitive judgments was moderately stable across the Hx and PE subtasks. Taken together, findings underscore the importance of assessing medical students' metacognitive judgments at different points during a clinical encounter."
Transfer of Clinical Reasoning Trained With a Serious Game to Comparable Clinical Problems A Prospective Randomized Study,SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE-JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE,"Introduction Serious Games can be used effectively for clinical reasoning training in medical education. Case specificity of learning outcome elicited by Serious Games has not been studied in detail. This study investigated whether learning outcome elicited by repeated exposure to virtual patient cases is transferable to other cases addressing similar problems. Methods In this monocentric, prospective, randomized trial, 69 fifth-year medical students participated in ten 90-minute sessions of using a computer-based emergency ward simulation game. Students were randomized to 3 groups (A, B, AB) and subsequently exposed to up to 46 different virtual patients. Group A was presented with 2 specific cases that were not shown in group B and vice versa. Group AB was exposed to all 4 specific cases. After 6 weeks of using the game as a learning resource, students were presented with 4 cases addressing similar problems. For each case, an aggregate score reflecting clinical reasoning was calculated, and performance was compared across groups. Results In the final session, there were no significant between-group differences regarding the sum score reflecting aggregated performance in all 4 cases (A: 66.5 +/- 7.2% vs. B: 61.9 +/- 12.4% vs. AB: 64.8 +/- 11.1%, P = 0.399). An item-by-item analysis revealed that there were no between-group differences regarding correct therapeutic interventions. Conclusions Previous exposure had limited impact on subsequent performance in similar cases. This study suggests that case specificity of learning outcome elicited by the serious game is low and that acquired higher-order cognitive functions may transfer to similar virtual patients."
Evaluating the Clinical Reasoning of Student Health Professionals in Placement and Simulation Settings: A Systematic Review,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,"(1) Background: Clinical reasoning is essential to the effective practice of autonomous health professionals and is, therefore, an essential capability to develop as students. This review aimed to systematically identify the tools available to health professional educators to evaluate students' attainment of clinical reasoning capabilities in clinical placement and simulation settings. (2) Methods: A systemic review of seven databases was undertaken. Peer-reviewed, English-language publications reporting studies that developed or tested relevant tools were included. Searches included multiple terms related to clinical reasoning and health disciplines. Data regarding each tool's conceptual basis and evaluated constructs were systematically extracted and analysed. (3) Results: Most of the 61 included papers evaluated students in medical and nursing disciplines, and over half reported on the Script Concordance Test or Lasater Clinical Judgement Rubric. A number of conceptual frameworks were referenced, though many papers did not reference any framework. (4) Conclusions: Overall, key outcomes highlighted an emphasis on diagnostic reasoning, as opposed to management reasoning. Tools were predominantly aligned with individual health disciplines and with limited cross-referencing within the field. Future research into clinical reasoning evaluation tools should build on and refer to existing approaches and consider contributions across professional disciplinary divides."
Assessing clinical reasoning (ASCLIRE): Instrument development and validation,ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION,"Clinical reasoning is an essential competency in medical education. This study aimed at developing and validating a test to assess diagnostic accuracy, collected information, and diagnostic decision time in clinical reasoning. A norm-referenced computer-based test for the assessment of clinical reasoning (ASCLIRE) was developed, integrating the entire clinical decision process. In a cross-sectional study participants were asked to choose as many diagnostic measures as they deemed necessary to diagnose the underlying disease of six different cases with acute or sub-acute dyspnea and provide a diagnosis. 283 students and 20 content experts participated. In addition to diagnostic accuracy, respective decision time and number of used relevant diagnostic measures were documented as distinct performance indicators. The empirical structure of the test was investigated using a structural equation modeling approach. Experts showed higher accuracy rates and lower decision times than students. In a cross-sectional comparison, the diagnostic accuracy of students improved with the year of study. Wrong diagnoses provided by our sample were comparable to wrong diagnoses in practice. We found an excellent fit for a model with three latent factors-diagnostic accuracy, decision time, and choice of relevant diagnostic information-with diagnostic accuracy showing no significant correlation with decision time. ASCLIRE considers decision time as an important performance indicator beneath diagnostic accuracy and provides evidence that clinical reasoning is a complex ability comprising diagnostic accuracy, decision time, and choice of relevant diagnostic information as three partly correlated but still distinct aspects."
Evidence of Construct Validity of Computer-Based Tests for Clinical Reasoning: Instrument Validation Study,JMIR SERIOUS GAMES,"Background: Clinical reasoning (CR) is a fundamental skill for all medical students. In our medical education system, however, there are shortcomings in the conventional methods of teaching CR. New technology is needed to enhance our CR teaching, especially as we are facing an influx of new health trainees. China Medical University (CMU), in response to this need, has developed a computer-based CR training system (CMU-CBCRT). Objective: We aimed to find evidence of construct validity of the CMU-CBCRT. Methods: We recruited 385 students from fifth year undergraduates to postgraduate year (PGY) 3 to complete the test on CMU-CBCRT. The known-groups technique was used to evaluate the construct validity of the CBCRT by comparing the test scores among 4 training levels (fifth year MD, PGY-1, PGY-2, and PGY-3). Results: We found that test scores increased with years of training. Significant differences were found in the test scores on information collection, diagnosis, and treatment and total scores among different training years of participants. However, significant results were not found for treatment errors. Conclusions: We provided evidence of construct validity of the CMU-CBCRT, which could determine the CR skills of medical students at varying early stage in their careers."
SIMULATION IN MEDICAL EDUCATION,EDUCATION IN THE KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY,"In last twenty years, we are seeing increasingly widespread use of simulations in the training of doctors and other professionals of health sciences at the different stages of their educational continuum (undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing medical education). So much so that the concept of simulations-based medical education has emerged and it is now recognized as a vital tool to ensure the learning of medical students and doctors, and to improve patient safety. This article will describe the reasons for the introduction and development of this new methodology, its advantages and the different models and currently available resources. We will describe also the characteristics of so-called simulation centres or clinical skills laboratories that have been developed worldwide, where the simulation-based medical education take place. Moreover, we will refer briefly to the situation in our country and finally to the principles of a good development of the simulation-based medical education."
Contextualizing the relevance of basic sciences: small-group simulation with debrief for first- and second-year medical students in an integrated curriculum,ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND PRACTICE,"Aim: There has been a call for increased integration of basic and clinical sciences during preclinical years of undergraduate medical education. Despite the recognition that clinical simulation is an effective pedagogical tool, little has been reported on its use to demonstrate the relevance of basic science principles to the practice of clinical medicine. We hypothesized that simulation with an integrated science and clinical debrief used with early learners would illustrate the importance of basic science principles in clinical diagnosis and management of patients. Methods: Small groups of first- and second-year medical students were engaged in a high-fidelity simulation followed by a comprehensive debrief facilitated by a basic scientist and clinician. Surveys including anchored and open-ended questions were distributed at the conclusion of each experience. Results: The majority of the students agreed that simulation followed by an integrated debrief illustrated the clinical relevance of basic sciences ( mean +/- standard deviation: 93.8% +/- 2.9% of first-year medical students; 96.7% +/- 3.5% of second-year medical students) and its importance in patient care (92.8% of first-year medical students; 90.4% of second-year medical students). In a thematic analysis of open-ended responses, students felt that these experiences provided opportunities for direct application of scientific knowledge to diagnosis and treatment, improving student knowledge, simulating real-world experience, and developing clinical reasoning, all of which specifically helped them understand the clinical relevance of basic sciences. Conclusion: Small-group simulation followed by a debrief that integrates basic and clinical sciences is an effective means of demonstrating the relationship between scientific fundamentals and patient care for early learners. As more medical schools embrace integrated curricula and seek opportunities for integration, our model is a novel approach that can be utilized."
Deepening the quality of clinical reasoning and decision-making in rural hospital nursing practice,RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH,"Introduction: Rural acute care nursing requires an extensive breadth and depth of knowledge as well as the ability to quickly reason through problems in order to make sound clinical decisions. This reasoning often occurs within an environment that has minimal medical or ancillary support. Registered nurses (RN) new to rural nursing, and employers, have raised concerns about patient safety while new nurses make the transition into rural practice. In addition, feeling unprepared for the rigors of rural hospital nursing practice is a central issue influencing RN recruitment and retention. Understanding how rural RNs reason is a key element for identifying professional development needs and may support recruitment and retention of skilled rural nurses. The purpose of this study was to explore how rural RNs reason through clinical problems as well as to assess the quality of such reasoning. Methods: This study used a non-traditional approach for data collection. Fifteen rural acute care nurses with varying years of experience working in southern Alberta, Canada, were observed while they provided care to patients of varying acuity within a simulated rural setting. Following the simulation, semi-structured interviews were conducted using a substantive approach to critical thinking. Results: Findings revealed that the ability to engage in deep clinical reasoning varied considerably among participants despite being given the same information under the same circumstances. Furthermore, the number of years of experience did not seem to be directly linked to the ability to engage in sound clinical reasoning. Novice nurses, however, did rely heavily on others in their decision making in order to ensure they were making the right decision. Hence, their relationships with other staff members influenced their ability to engage in clinical reasoning and decision making. In situations where the patient's condition was deteriorating quickly, regardless of years of experience, all of the participants depended on their colleagues when making decisions and reasoning throughout the simulation. Conclusions: Deep clinical reasoning and decision making is a function of reflection and self-correction that requires a critical self-awareness and is more about how nurses think than what they think. The degree of sophistication in reasoning of experts and novices is at times equivalent in that the reasoning of experts and novices can be somewhat limited and focused primarily on human physicality and less on conceptual knowledge. To become proficient in clinical reasoning, practice is necessary. The study supports the accumulating evidence that using clinical simulation and reflective interviewing that emphasize how clinical decisions are made enhances reasoning skills and confidence."
Web-Based Immersive Virtual Patient Simulators: Positive Effect on Clinical Reasoning in Medical Education,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,"Background: Clinical reasoning is based on the declarative and procedural knowledge of workflows in clinical medicine. Educational approaches such as problem-based learning or mannequin simulators support learning of procedural knowledge. Immersive patient simulators (IPSs) go one step further as they allow an illusionary immersion into a synthetic world. Students can freely navigate an avatar through a three-dimensional environment, interact with the virtual surroundings, and treat virtual patients. By playful learning with IPS, medical workflows can be repetitively trained and internalized. As there are only a few university-driven IPS with a profound amount of medical knowledge available, we developed a university-based IPS framework. Our simulator is free to use and combines a high degree of immersion with in-depth medical content. By adding disease-specific content modules, the simulator framework can be expanded depending on the curricular demands. However, these new educational tools compete with the traditional teaching Objective: It was our aim to develop an educational content module that teaches clinical and therapeutic workflows in surgical oncology. Furthermore, we wanted to examine how the use of this module affects student performance. Methods: The new module was based on the declarative and procedural learning targets of the official German medical examination regulations. The module was added to our custom-made IPS named ALICE (Artificial Learning Interface for Clinical Education). ALICE was evaluated on 62 third-year students. Results: Students showed a high degree of motivation when using the simulator as most of them had fun using it. ALICE showed positive impact on clinical reasoning as there was a significant improvement in determining the correct therapy after using the simulator. ALICE positively impacted the rise in declarative knowledge as there was improvement in answering multiple-choice questions before and after simulator use. Conclusions: ALICE has a positive effect on knowledge gain and raises students' motivation. It is a suitable tool for supporting clinical education in the blended learning context."
Situational awareness within objective structured clinical examination stations in undergraduate medical training - a literature search,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background: Medical students may not be able to identify the essential elements of situational awareness (SA) necessary for clinical reasoning. Recent studies suggest that students have little insight into cognitive processing and SA in clinical scenarios. Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) could be used to assess certain elements of situational awareness. The purpose of this paper is to review the literature with a view to identifying whether levels of SA based on Endsley's model can be assessed utilising OSCEs during undergraduate medical training. Methods: A systematic search was performed pertaining to SA and OSCEs, to identify studies published between January 1975 (first paper describing an OSCE) and February 2017, in peer reviewed international journals published in English. PUBMED, EMBASE, PsycINFO Ovid and SCOPUS were searched for papers that described the assessment of SA using OSCEs among undergraduate medical students. Key search terms included objective structured clinical examination, objective structured clinical assessment or OSCE and non-technical skills, sense-making, clinical reasoning, perception, comprehension, projection, situation awareness, situational awareness and situation assessment. Boolean operators (AND, OR) were used as conjunctions to narrow the search strategy, resulting in the limitation of papers relevant to the research interest. Areas of interest were elements of SA that can be assessed by these examinations. Results: The initial search of the literature retrieved 1127 publications. Upon removal of duplicates and papers relating to nursing, paramedical disciplines, pharmacy and veterinary education by title, abstract or full text, 11 articles were eligible for inclusion as related to the assessment of elements of SA in undergraduate medical students. Discussion: Review of the literature suggests that whole-task OSCEs enable the evaluation of SA associated with clinical reasoning skills. If they address the levels of SA, these OSCEs can provide supportive feedback and strengthen educational measures associated with higher diagnostic accuracy and reasoning abilities. Conclusion: Based on the findings, the early exposure of medical students to SA is recommended, utilising OSCEs to evaluate and facilitate SA in dynamic environments."
Serious Games in Surgical Medical Education: A Virtual Emergency Department as a Tool for Teaching Clinical Reasoning to Medical Students,JMIR SERIOUS GAMES,"Background: Serious games enable the simulation of daily working practices and constitute a potential tool for teaching both declarative and procedural knowledge. The availability of educational serious games offering a high-fidelity, three-dimensional environment in combination with profound medical background is limited, and most published studies have assessed student satisfaction rather than learning outcome as a function of game use. Objective: This study aimed to test the effect of a serious game simulating an emergency department (EMERGE) on students' declarative and procedural knowledge, as well as their satisfaction with the serious game. Methods: This nonrandomized trial was performed at the Department of General, Visceral and Cancer Surgery at University Hospital Cologne, Germany. A total of 140 medical students in the clinical part of their training (5th to 12th semester) self-selected to participate in this experimental study. Declarative knowledge (measured with 20 multiple choice questions) and procedural knowledge (measured with written questions derived from an Objective Structured Clinical Examination station) were assessed before and after working with EMERGE. Students' impression of the effectiveness and applicability of EMERGE were measured on a 6-point Likert scale. Results: A pretest-posttest comparison yielded a significant increase in declarative knowledge. The percentage of correct answers to multiple choice questions increased from before (mean 60.4, SD 16.6) to after (mean 76.0, SD 11.6) playing EMERGE (P<.001). The effect on declarative knowledge was larger in students in lower semesters than in students in higher semesters (P<.001). Additionally, students' overall impression of EMERGE was positive. Conclusions: Students self-selecting to use a serious game in addition to formal teaching gain declarative and procedural knowledge."
Implementing tutoring strategies into a patient simulator for clinical reasoning learning,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE,"Objective: This paper describes an approach for developing intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) for teaching clinical reasoning. Materials and methods: Our approach to ITS for clinical reasoning uses a novel hybrid knowledge representation for the pedagogic model, combining finite state machines to model different phases in the diagnostic process, production rules to model triggering conditions for feedback in different phases, temporal logic to express triggering conditions based upon past states of the student's problem solving trace, and finite state machines to model feedback dialogues between the student and TeachMed. The expert model is represented by an influence diagram capturing the relationship between evidence and hypotheses related to a clinical case. Results: This approach is implemented into TeachMed, a patient simulator we are developing to support clinical reasoning learning for a problem-based learning medical curriculum at our institution; we demonstrate some scenarios of tutoring feedback generated using this approach. Conclusion: Each of the knowledge representation formalisms that we use has already been proven successful in different applications of artificial intelligence and software engineering, but their integration into a coherent pedagogic model as we propose is unique. The examples we discuss illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, making it promising for the development of complex ITS, not only for clinical reasoning learning, but potentially for other domains as well.

Virtual Patient as A Multimedia Learning Tool to Help Students Learn Clinical Reasoning Skills in Medicine,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND ALLIED SCIENCES,"Background: Numerous instructional methods are used in medical education, including interactive lectures, problem-based learning (PBL), case-based learning, and bedside teaching. Bedside teaching provides students with a real-life experience interacting with patients. Therefore, researchers have been working to create computer programs with virtual patients (VPs) that simulate live patients, which aim to improve medical student clinical reasoning skills without the need of live patients. Aims: To study the perception of medical students at King Saud University (KSU) of the Diagnostic Reasoning program (DxR) as a learning tool in the hybrid curriculum. Study Design: Cross-section study conducted at the College of Medicine, KSU, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia using qualitative and quantitative data collection methods. Methods: The data was collected from third, fourth, and fifth year medical undergraduate students of both genders, from November 2014 until March 2015. Results: The results were divided into ten categories according to five themes: learning, specialty, assessment, authenticity, and implementation. In correlation with our reviewed literature, one of the primary targets of virtual patients is to stimulate relative thinking and problem solving. The students claimed that it was an enjoyable experience that allowed them to practice their skills in history taking, physical examination, ordering investigations and treating accordingly. It was also found that student satisfaction increased relative to the number of cases they attempted (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The study evaluates the medical students' perception of DxR in the system-based hybrid curriculum at KSU. Our findings show that DxR leads to positive knowledge and skill outcomes. Students believed that further DxR training workshops should be implemented in order to improve software usage."
Digital Tools to Enhance Clinical Reasoning,MEDICAL CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA,"Physicians can improve their diagnostic acumen by adopting a simulation based approach to analyzing published cases. The tight coupling of clinical problems and their solutions affords physicians the opportunity to efficiently upgrade their illness scripts (structured knowledge of a specific disease) and schemas (structured frameworks for common problems). The more the number of times clinicians practice accessing and applying those knowledge structures through published cases, the greater the odds that they will have an enhanced approach to similar patient cases in the future. This article highlights digital resources that increase the number of cases a clinician experiences and learns from."
Online Virtual Simulation and Diagnostic Reasoning: A Scoping Review,CLINICAL SIMULATION IN NURSING,"Background: Virtual reality technology can range from bedside learning to computerized tools accessed exclusively online; yet there is little evidence of the effectiveness of online virtual simulation for teaching diagnostic reasoning to health care providers. To address this gap, an examination of virtual simulation encounters in the online classroom was undertaken to inform education of a variety of health care providers, including nurse practitioners, registered nurses, and physicians. Method: Arskey and O'Malley's (2005) framework was the methodology used to conduct the scoping review. Result: Twelve studies published between 2008 and 2015 were identified from a search of 14 databases. The study sample included physicians and medical students (seven), baccalaureate nursing students (two), associate degree nursing students (one), and providers from other fields such as pharmacists, physiotherapists, sports medicine, forensics, and veterinarians. Conclusion: Online virtual simulation was comparable or superior to traditional simulation methods where increased engagement with learning occurred in a safe environment with convenient access.

Simulation in graduate medical education 2008: A review for emergency medicine,ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE,"Health care simulation includes a variety of educational techniques used to complement actual patient experiences with realistic yet artificial exercises. This field is rapidly growing and is widely used in emergency medicine (EM) graduate medical education (GME) programs. We describe the state of simulation in EM resident education, including its role in learning and assessment. The use of medical simulation in GME is increasing for a number of reasons, including the limitations of the 80-hour resident work week, patient dissatisfaction with being practiced on, a greater emphasis on patient safety, and the importance of early acquisition of complex clinical skills. Simulation-based assessment (SBA) is advancing to the point where it can revolutionize the way clinical competence is assessed in residency training programs. This article also discusses the design of simulation centers and the resources available for developing simulation programs in graduate EM education. The level of interest in these resources is evident by the numerous national EM organizations with internal working groups focusing on simulation. In the future, the health care system will likely follow the example of the airline industry, nuclear power plants, and the military, making rigorous simulation-based training and evaluation a routine part of education and practice."
Collaborative environment for clinical reasoning and distance learning sessions,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS,"Background: The medical curriculum has changed with the adoption of the student-centered learning paradigm. Clinical reasoning learning (CRL) is used in order to develop and improve students' clinical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Purpose: We have observed that, in complement to traditional CRL sessions, students commonly consult resources available on the internet. Based on this observation, our objective is to create computer tools to coordinate CRL sessions at distance, integrating these electronic resources at every step of the reasoning process. Material and methods: In order to create the system, we elaborated an object-oriented model of a computer-supported collaborative learning environment. The proposed system includes a Local web-server to store electronic resources and a relational database to store their electronic addresses (urls). JAVA(TM) was used as the programming language. Results: We developed a set of cooperative platform-independent tools. This environment includes a communication tool. Multimedia data exchange is possible. Information is shared thanks to an electronic notepad and whiteboard tools. Perspectives: This learning environment will be integrated in the French Virtual Medical University project, and is intended to be used for undergraduate, internships, residency or continuing medical education.

An Investigation into the Clinical Reasoning Development of Veterinary Students,JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Clinical reasoning is a fundamental skill for veterinary clinicians and a competency required of graduates by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. However, it is unknown how veterinary students develop reasoning skills and where strengths and shortcomings of curricula lie. This research aimed to use the University of Nottingham School of Veterinary Medicine and Science (SVMS) as a case study to investigate the development of clinical reasoning among veterinary students. The analysis was framed in consideration of the taught, learned, and declared curricula. Sixteen staff and sixteen students from the SVMS participated separately in a total of four focus groups. In addition, five interviews were conducted with recent SVMS graduates. Audio transcriptions were used to conduct a thematic analysis. A content analysis was performed on all curriculum documentation. It was found that SVMS graduates feel they have a good level of reasoning ability, but they still experience a deficit in their reasoning capabilities when starting their first job. Overarching themes arising from the data suggest that a lack of responsibility for clinical decisions during the program and the embedded nature of the clinical reasoning skill within the curriculum could be restricting development. In addition, SVMS students would benefit from clinical reasoning training where factors influencing real life'' decisions (e.g., finances) are explored in more depth. Integrating these factors into the curriculum could lead to improved decision-making ability among SVMS graduates and better prepare students for the stressful transition to practice. These findings are likely to have implications for other veterinary curricula."
Simulation 2.0: Integrating Basic Scientists and Clinicians in a Simulation Environment,MEDICAL SCIENCE EDUCATOR,An increasing number of medical schools are implementing curricular changes that better integrate clinical and basic sciences throughout all four years of medical school. One of the most frequently cited reasons is to improve medical student clinical reasoning skills while simultaneously aiming to decrease the attrition of basic science knowledge. Multiple pedagogical strategies have been explored to achieve this goal. We have found that simulation is a viable medium to integrate basic science within standardized patient encounters for early medical students.
Clinical Virtual Simulation as Lifelong Learning Strategy-Nurse's Verdict,CLINICAL SIMULATION IN NURSING,"Background: Lifelong Learning in nursing is one of the main strategies to enhance quality and safety in nursing care. Technological advances have Led to clinical virtual simulation (CVS) becoming a means of enhancing nurses' clinical reasoning skills within Lifelong Learning. However, Little is known about nurses' perceptions with regard to the ease of use and usefulness of CVS and their intention to use this technology. Aim: The aim of this study is to assess the ease of use and usefulness of CVS and the intention of emergency nurses to use CVS to enhance their clinical reasoning skills in Lifelong Learning. Methods: An exploratory, descriptive, and cross-sectional study was conducted using a quantitative approach. A nonprobabilistic sample of 131 emergency nurses was recruited from two Portuguese hospitals. The data were collected through a questionnaire (using a 10-point Likert scale) based on the technology acceptance model. Results: The results showed an average of perceived ease of use of the CVS of 9.03, perceived usefulness of 9.14, and an intention to use CVS in Lifelong Learning of 8.85. The results also showed an average of 8.96 concerning the relevance of CVS and an average of 9.34 with regard to its role as a facilitator in Lifelong Learning in nursing. Conclusion: CVS seems to be a strategy of great promise, as a novel approach in Lifelong Learning within the context of contemporary nursing.

Critical aspects of educating clinical management and clinical reasoning in primary teeth pulpotomy: A qualitative study based on the perspectives of experts and novices,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION,"Introduction In dental education, students must learn to integrate and coordinate complex knowledge, skills and attitudes and to transfer this learning to clinical practice. One major issue of concern in education in general and dental education, in particular, is to fill the gap between knowledge and practice. Methods The purpose of this study was to explore the problems that dental students have in transferring knowledge from the classroom to the real clinical setting. More specifically, we investigated the factors that complicate clinical management and clinical reasoning for these novices, including their common errors, in order to design an educational simulation programme in primary teeth pulpotomy. To this end, we conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with experts and novices, performing a thematic analysis of the data obtained. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Results For each major skill-clinical management and clinical reasoning-we identified complicating factors and common errors that related to the child (the patient), parents and dental student (the three main themes). For each theme, we identified further sub-themes. Conclusion The data obtained provided valuable insights into the factors that affect dental students' performance on clinical management and clinical reasoning in primary teeth pulpotomy."
Use of a structured approach and virtual simulation practice to improve diagnostic reasoning,DIAGNOSIS,"Objectives: In 2015, the National Academy of Medicine TOM estimated that 12 million patients were misdiagnosed annually. This suggests that despite prolonged training in medical school and residency there remains a need to improve diagnostic reasoning education. This study evaluates a new approach. Methods: A total of 285 medical students were enrolled in this 8 center, IRB approved trial. Students were randomized to receive training in either abdominal pain (AP) or loss of consciousness (LOC). Baseline diagnostic accuracy of the two different symptoms was assessed by completing a multiple-choice question (MCQ) examination and virtual patient encounters. Following a structured educational intervention, including a lecture on the diagnostic approach to that symptom and three virtual patient practice cases, each student was re-assessed. Results: The change in diagnostic accuracy on virtual patient encounters was compared between (1) baseline and post intervention and (2) post intervention students trained in the prescribed symptom vs. the alternate symptom (controls). The completeness of the student's differential diagnosis was also compared. Comparison of proportions were conducted using f-tests. Mixed-effects regressions were used to examine differences accounting for case and repeated measures. Compared with baseline, both the AP and LOC groups had marked post-intervention improvements in obtaining a correct final diagnosis; a 27% absolute improvement in the AP group (p<0.001) and a 32% absolute improvement in the LOC group (p<0.001). Compared with controls (the groups trained in the alternate symptoms), the rate of correct diagnoses increased by 13% but was not statistically significant (p=0.132). The completeness and efficiency of the differential diagnoses increased by 16% (beta=0.37, p<0.001) and 17% respectively (beta=0.45, p<0.001). Conclusions: The study showed that a virtual patient platform combined with a diagnostic reasoning framework could be used for education and diagnostic assessment and improved correct diagnosis compared with baseline performance in a simulated platform."
Using Clinical and Computer Simulations to Reason About the Impact of Context on System Safety and Technology-Induced Error,CONTEXT SENSITIVE HEALTH INFORMATICS: HUMAN AND SOCIOTECHNICAL APPROACHES,"This paper describes how simulations can be used to reason about the impact of user interface design features in exploring the effect of different contexts of use on the occurrence of technology-induced errors. The paper describes our approach in several phases, using an example from the analysis of technology-induced errors in medication administration. In the initial phase a clinical simulation is conducted to gather baseline data on the occurrence of technology-induced error using the technology under study. In this phase of the study, data arising from the clinical simulation are collected and then analyzed using qualitative and quantitative approaches to assess the relationship between aspects of interface design (i. e. usability problems) and rates of technology-induced error. In the next phase, the base rates for error associated with specific types of usability problems (from the initial phase) form the input into computer-based mathematical simulations. This approach links clinical simulations with computer-based simulations and demonstrates the potential impact of aspects of interface design and contextual factors upon medical error along with the implications for correcting interface design issues."
The contribution of the medical history for the diagnosis of simulated cases by medical students,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Objectives: The case history is an important part of diagnostic reasoning. The patient management problem method has been used in various studies, but may not reflect the actual reasoning process because a list of choices is given to the subjects in advance. This study investigated the contribution of the history to making the correct diagnosis by using clinical case simulation, in which students obtained clinical information by themselves. Methods: A prospective study was conducted. Ninety-four fifth-year medical students from Chiba University who underwent supervised clinical clerkships in 2009 were surveyed. Each student randomly selected 1 of 4 test cases and attempted to make a diagnosis through medical interview, physical examination, and laboratory tests, while the teacher acted as a patient. The student ranked the disease(s) diagnosed at each stage of the process. Diagnostic accuracy rates were compared using analysis of the chi(2)-test. Results: Sixty students (63.8%) made a correct diagnosis, which was based on the history in 43 students (71.7%), physical findings in 11 students (18.3%), and laboratory data in 6 students (10.0%). Compared with students who considered the correct diagnosis in their differential diagnosis after taking a history, students who failed to do so were 5.0 times (95% CI = 2.5-9.8) more likely to make a final misdiagnosis (chi(2)((1)) = 30.73; p<0.001). Conclusions: History taking is especially important for making a correct diagnosis when students perform clinical case simulation. To improve the diagnostic reasoning skills, medical students should be trained in methods for inferring the correct diagnosis from the case history."
The Effect of Simulation Wars on EM Residents' Global Rating Scales and In-Training Examination Scores,OPEN ACCESS EMERGENCY MEDICINE,"Purpose: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) restricted the duty hours for residents training in 2004. With less time to learn medicine, residents may not develop the clinical reasoning skills needed. Simulation can provide a remedy for this lack of time by allowing residents to practice skills and develop clinical reasoning in a simulated environment. Simulation Wars (SimWars), a clinical reasoning simulation has been shown to improve clinical reasoning skills. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of Simulation Wars on In-Training Examination (ITE) Scores and Global Rating Scale (GRS) Scores in Emergency Medicine (EM) residents. Methods: The Quasi-Experimental design was used in this retrospective study. The main comparison was between historical controls, the residents who did not participate in the Simulation Wars, and the intervention group comprised of residents who participated in the SimWars. Results: A total of 127 residents were participants in this study including 70 from the intervention and 57 from the historical control group. There were no significant differences found in GRS scores between both groups except for Communication and Professionalism (p<0.001). No overall improvement in ITE scores for the control group and for the intervention group was found. Furthermore, within the intervention group, while comparing those residents who participated in certain subcategories of SimWars and those who did not, there was a significant improvement in ITE scores in the subcategories of Thoracic Disorders, Abdominal/Gastrointestinal, Trauma Disorders and OBGyn. Conclusion: SimWars in the subcategories of Abdominal/Gastrointestinal, Thoracic, OBGyn and Trauma were found to be associated with improved ITE scores in those subcategories. Since Emergency Medicine utilizes extensive clinical reasoning skills, SimWars may provide better educational opportunities for EM residents."
The Impact of a Diagnostic Reminder System on Student Clinical Reasoning During Simulated Case Studies,SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE-JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE,"Introduction: Diagnostic reminder systems (DRS) may help students improve their clinical reasoning skill and gain competency in using informatics tools. This study explored the influence of Isabel PRO, a web-based DRS, on student diagnostic reasoning during simulated encounters. Methods: Diagnostic reasoning was assessed in 20 fourth-year medical students during four simulated case scenarios. After seeing each case, students submitted diagnostic hypotheses before (Pre-Isabel) and after (Post-Isabel) using Isabel Pro. The quality of the Pre- and Post-Isabel diagnostic hypotheses was assessed and compared to determine the impact of a DRS on student diagnostic reasoning. A follow-up survey and focus group identified student perception toward the use of a DRS in educational settings. Results: Paired t testing demonstrated that diagnostic accuracy significantly improved after using Isabel PRO (P < 0.05). Students found the software relatively simple to learn, felt that it helped them reflect on diagnostic options that they had not originally considered, and valued the opportunity to use the software in conjunction with simulated cases. Conclusions: Despite limited experience, students were able to effectively use a DRS to improve their diagnostic accuracy. Use of a DRS within the context of a patient case represents a distinct clinical skill set requiring appropriate training. Providing learners with gold standard examples of how to best use a specific informatics tool within specific clinical situations is an essential learning component. Simulated case scenarios offer an appropriate platform for introducing diagnostic support tools to learners within a clinical context. (Sim Healthcare 6: 11-17, 2011)"
Description and student self-evaluation of a pilot integrated small group learning and simulation programme for medical students in the first clinical year,INTERNAL MEDICINE JOURNAL,"Background: Contemporary education for medical students should be student-centred, integrated and contextualised. Small group learning promotes clinical reasoning and skills for lifelong learning. Simulation can provide experiential learning in a safe and controlled environment. We developed a weekly integrated problem-based learning and simulation programme (IPS) over two semesters in the first clinical year to augment clinical placement experience and contextualise theory into work-relevant practice. Aim: To evaluate the new programme at Kirkpatrick level 1. Methods: An anonymous survey of participating students. Results: The programme was well liked. Students found the programme relevant and that they had a better understanding of patient safety and the assessment of the deteriorating patient. They felt it contributed to integration of theory and practice, clinical reasoning and the acquisition of non-technical skills, particularly affective and communication elements. Conclusion: This IPS programme in the first clinical year can deliver a student-centred curriculum to complement clinical placement that delivers the important requirements of contemporary medical student education."
Advancing clinical reasoning in virtual patients - development and application of a conceptual framework,GMS JOURNAL FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background: Clinical reasoning is a complex skill students have to acquire during their education. For educators it is difficult to explain their reasoning to students, because it is partly an automatic and unconscious process. Virtual Patients (VPs) are used to support the acquisition of clinical reasoning skills in healthcare education. However, until now it remains unclear which features or settings of VPs optimally foster clinical reasoning. Therefore, our aims were to identify key concepts of the clinical reasoning process in a qualitative approach and draw conclusions on how each concept can be enhanced to advance the learning of clinical reasoning with virtual patients. Methods: We chose a grounded theory approach to identify key categories and concepts of learning clinical reasoning and develop a framework. Throughout this process, the emerging codes were discussed with a panel of interdisciplinary experts. In a second step we applied the framework to virtual patients. Results: Based on the data we identified the core category as the multifactorial nature of learning clinical reasoning. This category is reflected in the following five main categories: Psychological Theories, Patient-centeredness, Context, Learner-centeredness, and Teaching/Assessment. Each category encompasses between four and six related concepts. Conclusions: With our approach we were able to elaborate how key categories and concepts of clinical reasoning can be applied to virtual patients. This includes aspects such as allowing learners to access a large number of VPs with adaptable levels of complexity and feedback or emphasizing dual processing, errors, and uncertainty."
Advancing the assessment of clinical reasoning across the health professions: Definitional and methodologic recommendations,PERSPECTIVES ON MEDICAL EDUCATION,"The importance of clinical reasoning in patient care is well-recognized across all health professions. Validity evidence supporting high quality clinical reasoning assessment is essential to ensure health professional schools are graduating learners competent in this domain. However, through the course of a large scoping review, we encountered inconsistent terminology for clinical reasoning and inconsistent reporting of methodology, reflecting a somewhat fractured body of literature on clinical reasoning assessment. These inconsistencies impeded our ability to synthesize across studies and appropriately compare assessment tools. More specifically, we encountered: 1) a wide array of clinical reasoning-like terms that were rarely defined or informed by a conceptual framework, 2) limited details of assessment methodology, and 3) inconsistent reporting of the steps taken to establish validity evidence for clinical reasoning assessments. Consolidating our experience in conducting this review, we provide recommendations on key definitional and methodologic elements to better support the development, description, study, and reporting of clinical reasoning assessments."
Comparing Students' Clinical Grades to Scores on a Standardized Patient Note-Writing Task,JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE,"Background Few assessments capture the diagnostic impressions medical students form immediately following patient encounters. However, notes written for objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) allow learners to document their clinical reasoning in real time. The University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine (UIC-COM) has developed a rubric for scoring patient notes (PNs) in their OSCE for senior students. Objective To validate the UIC-COM PN Scoring Rubric as a measure of clinical reasoning by comparing PN scores from a similar exam at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons (VP&S) to clinical rotation performance. Design Cross-sectional analysis. Participants From a total of 146 third-year medical students who completed the OSCE at VP&S in spring 2017, we selected 60 at random, 20 from each tertile of clinical rotation performance. Main Measures We scored these students' PNs using the rubric's four sections-Documentation, Differential Diagnosis, Justification, and Workup, each scored from 1 to 4-and calculated a composite score (maximum 100). We used one-way ANOVA to examine differences in scores between clinical rotation performance tertiles. Key Results Students in the bottom, middle, and top clinical rotation performance tertiles had mean Documentation scores of 2.54, 2.63, and 2.88, respectively (p= 0.02, bottom vs. top tertile). Mean composite scores were 61.98, 64.05, and 67.86, respectively (p= 0.02, bottom vs. top tertile). Conclusions We showed an association between PN scores and clinical rotation performance. Since clinical rotation grades incorporate multiple types of assessments of students' clinical reasoning skills, we believe that this correlation lends validity evidence to using the note-writing task as a measure of clinical reasoning. Future directions include expanding the task to different stages of learners, to real life patient encounters, and to formative rather than summative assessments of note-writing skills."
Analysis of midwifery teachers' approach to identifying student midwives with poor clinical reasoning skills,MIDWIFERY,"Objective: To analyse midwifery teachers' pedagogic approaches to remediation for student midwives with poor clinical reasoning skills. Methods: A mixed-methods approach using a questionnaire and in-depth interviews. Setting: Midwifery schools in France. Participants: Teachers in French midwifery schools. Measurements and findings: A quarter of the teachers had no training in clinical reasoning. Midwifery teachers mainly identified students' clinical reasoning difficulties during clinical supervision with a non-validated tool. All teachers detected the warning signs and the main obstacles identifying student midwives with poor clinical reasoning skills along with some identifying factors favouring those difficulties. However, the remedial strategies proposed were mainly reassessment without personalised corrective learning activities. Key conclusions: The approach to identifying student midwives with poor clinical reasoning skills was incomplete and remedial strategies were stereotypical. Implications for practice: Midwifery teachers should be trained to recognise their students' clinical reasoning issues to identify them early, using all types of learning activities. Remedial strategies should be implemented promptly, adapted to each student and foster the transfer of learning."
Live or computerized simulation of clinical encounters: Do clinicians work up patient cases differently?,MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND THE INTERNET IN MEDICINE,"Computer simulation of clinical encounters is increasingly used in clinical settings to train patient work-up. The aim of this prospective, controlled study was to compare the characteristics of data collection and diagnostic exploration of physicians working up cases with a standardized patient and in a computerized simulation. Six clinicians of different clinical experience in internal medicine worked up three cases with a standardized patient and through a computer simulation allowing free inquiry. After each encounter, we asked the subjects to justify the information collected and to comment on their working diagnoses. The characteristics of data collected and working diagnoses generated were assessed and compared, according to the simulation method used. In the computer simulation, physicians limited their data collection and focused earlier and more specifically on information and working diagnoses with high levels of relevance. They reached a similar diagnostic accuracy and made decisions of a similar relevance. Computer simulation with a free-inquiry approach reproduces the data collection and the diagnostic exploration observed in a standardized-patient simulation and promotes an early collection of relevant data. Its contribution to extend the competence of learners in clinical settings should be further evaluated."
Community pharmacists' clinical reasoning: a protocol analysis,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACY,"Background There are two fundamental approaches to clinical reasoning, intuitive and analytical. These approaches have yet to be well explored to describe how pharmacists make decisions to determine medication appropriateness. Objective (1) to identify the cognitive actions (i.e., operators) that pharmacists employ when they move from one cue (i.e., concept) to another, and (2) to describe the overall clinical reasoning approach taken by pharmacists when checking for medication appropriateness. Setting Pharmacists from a chain pharmacy in Canada were invited to participate in this study. Method Data was collected in private rooms using video recordings to capture simulated patient-pharmacist interactions of a new prescription medication. A simulated case scenario was used to gather two types of verbal reports, concurrent think-aloud and structured retrospective think-aloud from pharmacists. All verbal reports were video-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using protocol analysis. Main outcome measure Pharmacists' reasoning approaches when making medication appropriateness decisions. Results A total of 17 pharmacists participated. Pharmacists were most likely to use analytical clinical reasoning approaches when checking prescriptions and three used no clinical reasoning. When the pharmacists were asked specific questions regarding the decision-making model for pharmacy (i.e., check for indication, efficacy, safety, and adherence), 50% reported using analytical decision-making approaches, with a third of the decisions being made in hindsight. Conclusion The majority of the pharmacists followed an analytical decision-making approach to clinical reasoning. When the pharmacists were asked prompting questions about their medication-related decisions, they employed a combination of intuitive and analytical approaches. The pharmacists had the competency to check for medication appropriateness; though this knowledge was mostly restructured during the process of hindsight reasoning."
Realistic simulation as an educacional tool for medical students,SCIENTIA MEDICA,"Aims: Realistic simulation is part of a new possibility of teaching that encompasses not only the technical skills, but crisis management, leadership, team work, and clinical reasoning that do not reflect actual losses to the real patient. To conduct a review of literature on the use of realistic simulation emphasizing the undergraduate medical education and its most relevant and current aspects. Source of data: PubMed and LILACS databases were consulted, applying the medical subject headings patient simulation, students, medical and teaching/methods, considering articles published in the past three years. Using fluctuating reading of the abstracts with content analysis and recorded data and examination, 101 studies were found in accordance with the purpose of this review. Summary of findings: Articles report the importance and support of technology in aggregating improvements to medical education. Patient safety was described as a decisive factor in the implementation of realistic simulation in institutions worldwide. Various specialties were mentioned among the articles in addition to several specific procedures and aspects of standardized physical examination. There is an interest in studying the possible ways to assess students through realistic simulation. Skills in communication, leadership, decision making, team work and relationship doctor/patient appear in this review as the greatest benefit of information to students. Conclusions: Although realistic simulation is valued and have a rapid growth as an important resource in education, further studies need to be conducted and disseminated to provide concrete and effective evidences and measurements of this educational tool."
Long-Term Educational Impact of a Simulator Curriculum on Medical Student Education in an Internal Medicine Clerkship,SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE-JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE,"Background: Medical simulation is frequently used in postgraduate medical training, but its value and sustainability in medical student education are less clear. We report the first long-term experience of mannequin simulation in an internal medicine clerkship. Methods: During a 6-year period (2002-2009), 327 Harvard medical students participated in a simulator-based teaching experience designed to expose students to the principles of myocardial infarction (MI). This experience was additive to a 12-week clerkship curriculum. Through blinded survey instruments, we sought to determine how the simulator exercise modified student exposure to a core curricular objective in the traditional clerkship. We also sought student and faculty perception of this educational tool and factors important to sustainability. Results: Three hundred twenty-seven consecutive students were exposed to the simulation exercise and their experiences evaluated. Three hundred twenty-six students (99%) described the simulation experience as valuable, with >69% requesting multiple sessions be provided during each clerkship. Although a core objective, only 78% of students reported having a didactic teaching session on MI during the clerkship, and only 47% of students reported exposure to a live patient with MI. Furthermore, only 15% of students reported exposure to at least two different clinical presentations of MI, allowing comparison and reflection. Thus, the simulation exercise provided the only exposure to this topic for 22% of students and facilitated comparisons of different clinical presentations for 85% of students. When students participated in both the simulator and the didactic sessions, 74% favored the simulation exercise. Faculty cited small group size, once monthly delivery and focused curricula as key points for sustainability of this effort. Conclusion: Mannequin simulation is a valuable and sustainable addition to a third-year internal medicine clerkship. For some students, simulation provides otherwise unavailable exposure to core content material. For the majority of students, simulation also provides the only means of exposure to multiple presentations of a single illness. Together, these data strongly suggest that simulation promotes both experiential learning and comparative analysis in a clerkship setting. (Sim Healthcare 5:75-81, 2010)"
Is Clinical Trial Registration for Simulation-Based Research Necessary?,SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE-JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE,"Statement The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors requires that all clinical trials be prospectively registered before being considered for publication in their member journals. Clinical trial registries are Web-based databases of clinical trials, providing researchers, journal editors, and reviewers detailed study information to help inform trial results. What is unclear is whether clinical trial registration is required for simulation-based studies, where typically health care providers are the subjects and where the outcomes may be provider based or patient based. In this article, we describe the background and reasoning behind clinical trial registration and discuss whether simulation-based studies should be registered as a prerequisite to publication."
Increasing Authenticity of Simulation-Based Assessment in Diagnostic Radiology,SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE-JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE,"Introduction: Clinical reasoning in diagnostic imaging professions is a complex skill that requires processing of visual information and image manipulation skills. We developed a digital simulation-based test method to increase authenticity of image interpretation skill assessment. Methods: A digital application, allowing volumetric image viewing and manipulation, was used for three test administrations of the national Dutch Radiology Progress Test for residents. This study describes the development and implementation process in three phases. To assess authenticity of the digital tests, perceived image quality and correspondence to clinical practice were evaluated and compared with previous paper-based tests (PTs). Quantitative and qualitative evaluation results were used to improve subsequent tests. Results: Authenticity of the first digital test was not rated higher than the PTs. Test characteristics and environmental conditions, such as image manipulation options and ambient lighting, were optimized based on participants' comments. After adjustments in the third digital test, participants favored the image quality and clinical correspondence of the digital image questions over paper-based image questions. Conclusions: Digital simulations can increase authenticity of diagnostic radiology assessments compared with paper-based testing. However, authenticity does not necessarily increase with higher fidelity. It can be challenging to simulate the image interpretation task of clinical practice in a large-scale assessment setting, because of technological limitations. Optimizing image manipulation options, the level of ambient light, time limits, and question types can help improve authenticity of simulation-based radiology assessments."
"Improving the Clinical Skills Performance of Graduating Medical Students Using WISE OnCall, a Multimedia Educational Module",SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE-JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE,"Introduction: Transitions to residency programs are designed to maximize quality and safety of patient care, as medical students become residents. However, best instructional or readiness assessment practices are not yet established. We sought to study the impact of a screen-based interactive curriculum designed to prepare interns to address common clinical coverage issues (WISE OnCall) on the clinical skills demonstrated in simulation and hypothesize that performance would improve after completing the module. Methods: Senior medical students were recruited to participate in this single group prestudy/poststudy. Students responded to a call from a standardized nurse (SN) and assessed a standardized patient (SP) with low urine output, interacted with a 45-minute WISE OnCall module on the assessment and management of oliguria, and then evaluated a different SP with low urine output of a different underlying cause. Standardized patients assessed clinical skills with a 37-item, behaviorally anchored checklist measuring clinical skills (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC], 0.55-0.81). Standardized nurses rated care quality and safety and collaboration and interprofessional communication using a 33-item literature-based, anchored checklist (ICC, 0.47-0.52). Standardized patient and SN ratings of the same student performance were correlated (r, 0.37-0.62; P < 0.01). Physicians assessed clinical reasoning quality based on the students' patient encounter note (ICC, 0.55-0.68), ratings that did not correlate with SP and SN ratings. We compared pre-post clinical skills performance and clinical reasoning. Fifty-two medical students (31%) completed this institutional review board-approved study. Results: Performance as measured by the SPs, SNs, and the postencounter note all showed improvement with mostly moderate to large effect sizes (range of Cohen's d, 0.30-1.88; P < 0.05) after completion of the online module. Unexpectedly, professionalism as rated by the SP was poorer after the module (Cohen's d, -0.93; P = 0.000). Discussion: A brief computer-based educational intervention significantly improved graduating medical students' clinical skills needed to be ready for residency."
A Cross-Sectional Study: What Contributes to Nursing Students' Clinical Reasoning Competence?,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,"Clinical reasoning is a vital competence for nursing students, as it is required for solving problems arising in complex clinical situations. Identifying the factors that influence nursing students' clinical reasoning competence in the social context can help their implicit educational needs. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the factors associated with developing clinical reasoning competency among undergraduate nursing students. In total, 206 senior nursing students were included in this study. Self-reported measures were used to obtain data on participants' clinical reasoning competence, problem-solving abilities, academic self-efficacy, and level of clinical practicum stress. Relationships among continuous variables were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficients. A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to identify factors related to clinical reasoning competence. Our findings show that participants with better problem-solving abilities and academic self-efficacy perceived themselves as having higher levels of clinical reasoning competence. Nursing students with lower clinical practicum stress reported higher clinical reasoning competence. Significant factors identified were younger age and subcategories of problem-solving ability such as problem clarification, alternative solution development, planning/implementation, and self-regulated efficacy. Our findings highlight essential factors necessary for developing a nursing curriculum that contributes to professional nurses' clinical reasoning competence."
Level of clinical reasoning in intermediate nursing students explained by education year and days of internships per healthcare branches: A cross - sectional study,NURSE EDUCATION TODAY,"Background: Due to changes in health care nurses are achieving more responsibilities. Globally nurses are trained at different educational levels to become registered nurses. All nurses should be able to implement clinical reasoning in chronic and acute patient care. There is uncertainty in health care institutes about the level of performance of clinical reasoning in the intermediate nurses. Objectives: This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the level of clinical reasoning in intermediate nursing students in different education years. Furthermore, we explored whether the level of clinical reasoning can be explained by years of education and numbers of internship days in different healthcare settings. Design, setting and participants: All second, third and fourth year (n = 151) nursing students of one nursing school in the Netherlands were invited to participate in this study. Levels of clinical reasoning were assessed using the Dutch Lasater Clinical Judgment Rubric (D - LCJR). Methods: Twelve experienced nurses assessed the students during two days at the beginning of their education year in an educational simulation setting. Following the assessment protocol, the Rubric was scored in an interview after the students saw their patient. Results: We assessed 119 students. Fourth-year students scored on a significant higher level of clinical reasoning compared to the second - and third-year students (p < 0.001). Forty five percent of them reached an accomplished level of clinical reasoning. Second- and third-year students scored similar in their level of clinical reasoning (p = 0.61). In addition to education year an internship in the hospital care also explained the variation in level of clinical reasoning. Together they explained 38% (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Intermediate nursing students were successfully assessed on their level of clinical reasoning in an education environment. The level of clinical reasoning could be explained by education year and number of days internship in the hospital care."
Effects of bedside team-based learning on pediatric clinical practice in Chinese medical students,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background Bedside teaching is a primary educational tool to improve the clinical practice of medical students. As a new medical pedagogical approach, team-based learning (TBL) is gradually being integrated into Chinese medical education programmes to promote clinical reasoning, knowledge application, teamwork and collaboration. The aim of this controlled study is to investigate the effects of TBL on pediatric bedside teaching in medical students. Methods Thirty medical students in pediatric clinical practice were randomly assigned to an intervention and a control group. Students in the intervention group exposed bedside teaching activity with TBL while students in the control group received traditional bedside teaching. Teaching for the two groups was conducted biweekly, and the same clinical cases were selected for both groups with the same instructors. After six months of clinical practice, the differences of learning outcomes between the two groups were compared through assessments by computer-based case simulations (CCS) and mini-Clinical Evaluation Exercise (mini-CEX). Student feedback following completion of bedside teaching was collected by questionnaire. Results The CCS scores in the intervention group were significantly higher than that in the control group (p < 0.05). The mini-CEX results showed that clinical judgment and counseling skills of the intervention group were higher than those in the control group (p < 0.01). Medical interviewing skills and overall clinical competence in the intervention group were better than those in the control group (p < 0.05). In the questionnaire survey, students in the intervention group believed that bedside teaching activity with TBL could promote active learning ability, improve counseling skills and strengthen teamwork. Conclusions Application of TBL in bedside teaching not only enhanced clinical practice skills among medical students but also improved their clinical reasoning and counseling skills."
Virtual patients design and its effect on clinical reasoning and student experience: a protocol for a randomised factorial multi-centre study,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background: Virtual Patients (VPs) are web-based representations of realistic clinical cases. They are proposed as being an optimal method for teaching clinical reasoning skills. International standards exist which define precisely what constitutes a VP. There are multiple design possibilities for VPs, however there is little formal evidence to support individual design features. The purpose of this trial is to explore the effect of two different potentially important design features on clinical reasoning skills and the student experience. These are the branching case pathways (present or absent) and structured clinical reasoning feedback (present or absent). Methods/Design: This is a multi-centre randomised 2x2 factorial design study evaluating two independent variables of VP design, branching (present or absent), and structured clinical reasoning feedback (present or absent). The study will be carried out in medical student volunteers in one year group from three university medical schools in the United Kingdom, Warwick, Keele and Birmingham. There are four core musculoskeletal topics. Each case can be designed in four different ways, equating to 16 VPs required for the research. Students will be randomised to four groups, completing the four VP topics in the same order, but with each group exposed to a different VP design sequentially. All students will be exposed to the four designs. Primary outcomes are performance for each case design in a standardized fifteen item clinical reasoning assessment, integrated into each VP, which is identical for each topic. Additionally a 15-item self-reported evaluation is completed for each VP, based on a widely used EViP tool. Student patterns of use of the VPs will be recorded. In one centre, formative clinical and examination performance will be recorded, along with a self reported pre and post-intervention reasoning score, the DTI. Our power calculations indicate a sample size of 112 is required for both primary outcomes. Discussion: This trial will provide robust evidence to support the effectiveness of different designs of virtual patients, based on student performance and evaluation. The cases and all learning materials will be open access and available on a Creative Commons Attribution-Share-Alike license."
Utilization of high-fidelity simulation to address challenges with the basic science immunology education of preclinical medical students,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background Immune function and dysfunction are highly complex basic science concepts introduced in the preclinical medical school curriculum. A challenge for early learners is connecting the intricate details and concepts in immunology with clinical manifestations. This impedes relevance and applicability. The impetus in medical education reform is promoting consolidation of basic science and clinical medicine during the first two years of medical school. Simulation is an innovation now widely employed in medical schools to enhance clinical learning. Its use in basic science curriculums is largely deficient. The authors piloted simulation as a novel curricular approach to enhance fundamental immunology knowledge and clinical integration. Methods The authors introduced a Primary Immunodeficiency Disease (PIDD) simulation during a basic science immunology course for second-year medical students at the Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell. The simulation tasked small groups of students with evaluating, diagnosing and managing an infant with previously undiagnosed immunodeficiency. Joint facilitation by clinical and science faculty during terminal debriefings engaged students in Socratic discussion. Debriefing aimed to immerse basic science content in the context of the clinical case. Students completed a post-simulation Likert survey, assessing utility in reinforcing clinical reasoning, integration of basic science and clinical immunology, enhanced knowledge and understanding of immunodeficiency, and enhanced learning. A summative Immunodeficiency Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) question was created by faculty to assess students' recognition of a PIDD and clinical reasoning. Results The simulation was well received by students with > 90% endorsing each of the objectives on the post-simulation survey. The authors also determined a statistically significant score variance on the summative OSCE question. Higher scores were achieved by the cohort of students completing the OSCE post-simulation versus the cohort completing the OSCE pre-simulation. Conclusions The innovative use of simulation in a highly complex basic science immunology course provides relevance and consolidation for preclinical learners. Additional data will be collected to continuously assess application of concepts and proficiency stemming from this novel curricular intervention. The authors advocate the initiation and/or expansion of simulation in non-clinical basic science courses such as immunology to bridge the gap between theory and practice."
'I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.'- incorporating high-fidelity medical simulation into the undergraduate nephrology course,RENAL FAILURE,"Background Medical simulation is a teaching method, which enables the development of clinical skills by implementing a simulation scenario in a true-to-life environment, but without exposing patients to any risk. So far, there has been no information on the use of high-fidelity simulation in undergraduate clinical nephrology teaching. Aim of this study was to analyze students' opinions and reactions to the simulation module in nephrology. Methods The survey consisting of the Satisfaction with Simulation Experience Scale (SSES) and open-ended question concerning the overall impression of classes was conducted among 103 5(th) year medical students, who took part in the simulation training in nephrology. SSES consisted of three parts (debriefing, reasoning, education). Statements from the open-ended question were interpreted by means of the Atlas.ti software for qualitative data analysis. Results The overall score for simulation classes was 4.39 +/- 0.69 points. Students rated debriefing, reasoning and education at 4.43 +/- 0.78, 4.32 +/- 0.7 and 4.39 +/- 0.73 points, respectively. 87.4% and 84.5% of participants agreed that simulation developed their 'clinical reasoning' and 'decision-making' skills in nephrology, respectively. Thematic analysis revealed that students evaluated the module as 'interesting', 'useful' and 'informative', but they found number of classes significantly insufficient. Students pointed out that due to the small emphasis placed on practical aspects in the existing curriculum e.g. routes of drug administration and conversion of doses, they could not fully benefit from simulation. Conclusion Medical simulation is a valuable constituent of the nephrology course. Putting greater emphasis on practical aspects from the beginning of training may enable students to benefit more from simulation modules."
Challenges in mitigating context specificity in clinical reasoning: a report and reflection,DIAGNOSIS,"Objectives: Diagnostic error is a growing concern in U.S. healthcare. There is mounting evidence that errors may not always be due to knowledge gaps, but also to context specificity: a physician seeing two identical patient presentations from a content perspective (e.g., history, labs) yet arriving at two distinct diagnoses. This study used the lens of situated cognition theory - which views clinical reasoning as interconnected with surrounding contextual factors - to design and test an instructional module to mitigate the negative effects of context specificity. We hypothesized that experimental participants would perform better on the outcome measure than those in the control group. Methods: This study divided 39 resident and attending physicians into an experimental group receiving an interactive computer training and think-aloud exercise and a control group, comparing their clinical reasoning. Clinical reasoning performance in a simulated unstable angina case with contextual factors (i.e., diagnostic suggestion) was determined using performance on a post-encounter form (PEF) as the outcome measure. The participants who received the training and did the reflection were compared to those who did not using descriptive statistics and a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). Results: Descriptive statistics suggested slightly better performance for the experimental group, but MANCOVA results revealed no statistically significant differences (Pillai's Trace=0.20, F=1.9, df=[4, 29], p=0.15). Conclusions: While differences were not statistically significant, this study suggests the potential utility of strategies that provide education and awareness of contextual factors and space for reflective practice."
Comparative value of a simulation by gaming and a traditional teaching method to improve clinical reasoning skills necessary to detect patient deterioration: a randomized study in nursing students,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background Early detection and response to patient deterioration influence patient prognosis. Nursing education is therefore essential. The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to compare the respective educational value of simulation by gaming (SG) and a traditional teaching (TT) method to improve clinical reasoning (CR) skills necessary to detect patient deterioration. Methods In a prospective multicenter study, and after consent, 2nd year nursing students were randomized into two groups: Simulation by gaming SG: the student played individually with a serious game consisting of 2 cases followed by a common debriefing with an instructor; Traditional Teaching TT: the student worked on the same cases in text paper format followed by a traditional teaching course with a PowerPoint presentation by an instructor. CR skill was measured by script concordance tests (80 SCTs, score 0-100) immediately after the session (primary outcome) and on month later. Other outcomes included students' satisfaction, motivation and professional impact. Results One hundred forty-six students were randomized. Immediately after training, the SCTs scores were 59 +/- 9 in SG group (n = 73) and 58 +/- 8 in TT group (n = 73) (p = 0.43). One month later, the SCTs scores were 59 +/- 10 in SG group (n = 65) and 58 +/- 8 in TT group (n = 54) (p = 0.77). Global satisfaction and motivation were highly valued in both groups although significantly greater in the SG group (p < 0.05). The students declared that the training course would have a positive professional impact, with no difference between groups. Conclusions In this study assessing nursing student CR to detect patient deterioration, no significant educational difference (SCT), neither immediate nor 1 month later, was observed between training by SG and the TT course. However, satisfaction and motivation were found to be greater with the use of SG."
Using peer role-playing to improve students' clinical skills for musculoskeletal physical examinations,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,"BackgroundThe traditional curriculum for medical students in Japan does not include sufficient opportunities for students to develop their skills for musculoskeletal (MSK) examination and clinical reasoning and diagnosis. Therefore, an effective programme is required to help medical students and residents improve their clinical skills in MSK. This paper aims to assess the clinical skills of medical students who have participated in a peer role-playing simulation programme using a mini clinical evaluation exercise (mini-CEX).MethodsParticipants were 90 female medical students who were completing their first orthopaedic clinical clerkship. They were divided into two groups. The simulation group participated in a role-play focussed on MSK cases as low-fidelity simulation, a structured debriefing with the course supervisor, and a self-reflection on Day 1 (n=64). The control group did not participate in the role-play due to randomised clerkship schedules (n=26). On Day 2 of the intervention, we observed and assessed all participants' performances during MSK outpatient encounters using the mini-CEX. We compared the mini-CEX score between the simulation group and the control group; the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for statistical analysis.ResultsThe mini-CEX scores for physical examination, clinical reasoning and diagnosis, and overall clinical competency were significantly higher in the simulation group than in the control group (p<.05, physical examination: p=.014, clinical reasoning: p=.042, overall: p=.016). These findings suggest that medical students who partake in a peer role-playing simulation programme could experience improved clinical skills for physical examination, clinical reasoning and diagnosis, and overall clinical competency in real-life MSK outpatient encounters.ConclusionsThrough a mini-CEX assessment, our findings indicate that medical students who participated in our peer role-playing simulation programme have improved clinical skills. Peer role-playing as a low-fidelity simulation and practical educational opportunity will enable educators to polish the competency of medical students in musculoskeletal physical examinations and clinical reasoning and diagnosis in a clinical setting."
Twelve Tips for Developing Clinical Reasoning Skills in the Pre-Clinical and Clinical Stages of Medical School,MEDICAL TEACHER,"Clinical reasoning (CR) is a complex skill required in future clinicians. The best way to develop CR has not been fully elucidated in existing literature. Barriers to CR development include content, environmental, and teacher or expert physician factors. We have reviewed literature, interviewed medical students and teaching staff at the University of Nottingham, and evaluated our teaching delivery. We identified twelve strategies to combat barriers to CR learning at our university. The foundation for CR must be built early through lectures and case-based learning. We emphasize the irreplaceable nature of ward-based learning and add on methods of optimizing time on wards. Placement on acute wards with trained teaching staff to facilitate CR teaching was suggested. Ward time should be supplemented with symptom-focused teaching, patient workshops, simulation sessions, virtual case banks, and clinical skills practice. However, ward time is the utmost priority and must not be replaced."
Integrating High-Fidelity Simulation into a Medical Cardiovascular Physiology Curriculum,ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND PRACTICE,"Introduction: The challenges of transitioning from basic sciences to clerkships are well identified in medical education. High-fidelity simulations, which have established a track record of improving clinical reasoning and clinical skills, have been proposed as a viable approach to bridge the gap between basic sciences and clerkships. However, little is known about the results of using simulation to address the gap. Methods: In 2018, Morehouse School of Medicine enhanced the first-year cardiovascular physiology curriculum by integrating the high-fidelity simulation iStan into the cardiovascular physiology curriculum, with the purpose of early clinical exposure, cardiovascular concept mastery, and increased clinical associations. The integration included three structural design elements: (a) simulated clinical case introduction; (b) simulated clinical case development; and (c) student-led clinical case study. Results: The first-year medical (MD1) students' cardiovascular physiology learning outcomes have significantly improved compared to the last two cohorts of MD1 students, and the students' test-taking time was significantly reduced compared to the performance of the last two counterpart cohorts. Students reported increased engagement in the simulation-enhanced cardiovascular physiology curriculum. Conclusion: The findings provide preliminary evidence to suggest that the structural integration of high-fidelity simulation in the cardiovascular physiology curriculum proved successful in terms of students' learning experience and learning outcomes. The three central elements of high-fidelity simulation integration can inform future endeavor as a structural solution to effectively bridge the gaps between basic science concepts and clinical reasoning by using high-fidelity simulations."
Use of Real Patients and Patient-Simulation-Based Methodologies for Teaching Gastroenterology to Pre-Clinical Medical Students,HEALTHCARE,"In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on the need to integrate formal knowledge with clinical experience in the pre-clinical years since the initial years of medical education play an important role in shaping the attitudes of medical students towards medicine and support the development of clinical reasoning. In this study, we describe approaches that involve real patients and patient-simulation-based methodologies to teach gastroenterology to second year medical students. Our goals were to (i) demonstrate bio-psychosocial aspects of clinical practice, (ii) demonstrate commonality of gastrointestinal ailments, and (iii) help understand complex gastroenterology concepts. We used two main approaches including brief, pre-prepared questions and answers discussing with the patients in various sessions throughout the course and a two-hour session that included patient participation, patient simulation modalities with high fidelity mannequins, a lightening round of interactive cases, and a Patient Oriented Problem Solving (POPS) session. The approaches improved the effectiveness of the delivery of the content-heavy, fast-paced GI course and provided opportunities for the students to think about gastroenterology from both basic and clinical points of view. The approaches involved peer teaching, which supports knowledge acquisition and comprehension. Very positive feedback and overall engagement of students suggested that these approaches were well-received."
Exploring perceptions and barriers in developing critical thinking and clinical reasoning of nursing students: A qualitative study,NURSE EDUCATION TODAY,"Aim: The aims of this study were to explore year two nursing students' perceptions toward critical thinking and clinical reasoning and to identify the barriers faced by the students in developing critical thinking and clinical reasoning. Background: Critical thinking and clinical reasoning are core competencies emphasized in nursing practices. Nursing students are required to develop and practice these skills throughout their nursing programs to graduate as competent nurses. However, recent studies still report a lack of critical thinking and clinical reasoning in nursing students and fresh graduates. Hence, it is important to recognize the perceptions of nursing students and the barriers that they face in developing critical thinking and clinical reasoning skills. Methods: An exploratory descriptive qualitative study design was adopted. Twenty nursing students were recruited from a university in Singapore. Individual face-to-face interviews, using semi-structured questions and an interview guide, were conducted in the academic year 2018/2019. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. Results: Seven themes were emerged, namely: 1) essentials for nursing practices, 2) linking theory to practice, 3) individual thought process, 4) stimulating strategies, 5) classroom environment, 6) clinical environment, and 7) students' attributes. Nursing students perceived critical thinking and clinical reasoning as essential for nursing practices and described these skills as linking theory to practice. Strategies such as simulation, case studies, real clinical experiences, and guidance from clinical instructors/preceptors were found to stimulate critical thinking and clinical reasoning for the students. Barriers to developing critical thinking included classroom environments, such teaching methods and student-to-tutor ratios, ward environments/cultures, and students' attributes/attitudes toward learning. Conclusion: The findings provided areas for improvement in the current nursing education and practices to better support nursing students in developing critical thinking and clinical reasoning skills."
Clinical simulation: ?Does the simulation-based healthcare education pretend to replace traditional training in medicine and other health sciences on actual experience with patients?,UNIVERSITAS MEDICA,"Health education based on simulation is not designed to replace the learning that is obtained through the daily practices in hospitals with patients. Learning with patients is essential in the training of medical and health science professionals and, therefore, should never be a replacement. Clinical simulation is one of many teaching strategies, which trains optimally the student to confront the reality of practice with patients. Clinical simulation prepares the students, generating greater suitability in the processes, skills and attitudes, and prepares students to learn how to order their minds prior to confronting patients. Simulation is only a teaching strategy that serves as the training of various elements that make up the professional skills since skills per se will be apparent only when they have interactions with patients."
Clinical Virtual Simulation in Nursing Education: Randomized Controlled Trial,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,"Background: In the field of health care, knowledge and clinical reasoning are key with regard to quality and confidence in decision making. The development of knowledge and clinical reasoning is influenced not only by students' intrinsic factors but also by extrinsic factors such as satisfaction with taught content, pedagogic resources and pedagogic methods, and the nature of the objectives and challenges proposed. Nowadays, professors play the role of learning facilitators rather than simple lecturers and face students as active learners who are capable of attributing individual meanings to their personal goals, challenges, and experiences to build their own knowledge over time. Innovations in health simulation technologies have led to clinical virtual simulation. Clinical virtual simulation is the recreation of reality depicted on a computer screen and involves real people operating simulated systems. It is a type of simulation that places people in a central role through their exercising of motor control skills, decision skills, and communication skills using virtual patients in a variety of clinical settings. Clinical virtual simulation can provide a pedagogical strategy and can act as a facilitator of knowledge retention, clinical reasoning, improved satisfaction with learning, and finally, improved self-efficacy. However, little is known about its effectiveness with regard to satisfaction, self-efficacy, knowledge retention, and clinical reasoning. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of clinical virtual simulation with regard to knowledge retention, clinical reasoning, self-efficacy, and satisfaction with the learning experience among nursing students. Methods: A randomized controlled trial with a pretest and 2 posttests was carried out with Portuguese nursing students (N=42). The participants, split into 2 groups, had a lesson with the same objectives and timing. The experimental group (n=21) used a case-based learning approach, with clinical virtual simulator as a resource, whereas the control group (n=21) used the same case-based learning approach, with recourse to a low-fidelity simulator and a realistic environment. The classes were conducted by the usual course lecturers. We assessed knowledge and clinical reasoning before the intervention, after the intervention, and 2 months later, with a true or false and multiple-choice knowledge test. The students' levels of learning satisfaction and self-efficacy were assessed with a Likert scale after the intervention. Results: The experimental group made more significant improvements in knowledge after the intervention (P=.001; d=1.13) and 2 months later (P=.02; d=0.75), and it also showed higher levels of learning satisfaction (P<.001; d=1.33). We did not find statistical differences in self-efficacy perceptions (P=.9; d=0.054). Conclusions: The introduction of clinical virtual simulation in nursing education has the potential to improve knowledge retention and clinical reasoning in an initial stage and over time, and it increases the satisfaction with the learning experience among nursing students."

CRL sessions will be enriched by multimedia medical data. We created Virtu@l Consult@tion a Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning environment for CRL sessions. It can be used for undergraduates, internships, residency or continuing medical education at distance. It can also be useful to prepare physicians for telemedicine technologies."
Simulation in medical education,MEDICAL TEACHER,"Studies in cognitive psychology inform us that the recall of information and its application are best when it is taught and rehearsed in environments similar to workplace. The healthcare professions are heavily task- and performance-based where non-technical skills, decision making and clinical reasoning are important alongside integrity, empathy and compassion. Most of these attributes are difficult to teach and assess in the traditional classrooms. Enhanced patient safety on one hand has to be the ultimate outcome of any medical curriculum while on the other hand, it itself can be potentially compromised in an apprenticeship-based model of medical education. A range of simulation techniques are very well placed to be used alongside clinical placements. These can be employed to enhance learning of healthcare professionals in safe environments, without compromising the patient safety, while maintaining a high degree of realism. This article builds an argument for the use of simulation techniques to enhance patient safety and points the readers to the AMEE Guide No. 50<SU1</SU on simulation, which is written as a practical manual on building a simulation programme in healthcare education.</."
Impact of Simulation-Based Learning on National Ranking Medical Examination Results in France: A Randomized Trial (SimECNi Study),SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE-JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE,"Introduction In France, the National Ranking Examination (ECNi) evaluates medical students based on their clinical reasoning. Simulation-based education on ECNi preparation has not been assessed. Our objective is to establish the added value of high-fidelity (HF) simulation-based learning in ECNi preparation compared with the current standard. Methods We performed a controlled, prospective study. Fifth-year medical students from Nancy and Nice participated in a 3-phase process. In phase 1, students were tested on 6 themes (A-F) that were each presented as an ECNi clinical case and were randomized into 2 groups (#1 and #2). A 20-point grading scale was used. In phase 2, group #1 carried out HF simulation on themes A, B, and C, whereas group #2 did so on themes D, E, and F. Students were tested, in phase 3, with a new set of clinical cases on the same 6 themes. Progression in scores between phases 1 and 3 was analyzed. Results One hundred sixty-six medical students randomized into 2 groups partook in the study. In phase 1, there was no significant difference in scores between groups. In phase 3, group #1 had significantly higher scores than group #2 for cases A, B, and C. Scores were significantly higher in group #2 for cases D, E, and F. Average scoring significantly improved between phases 1 and 3 with a 1.4-point gain for cases A, B, and C in group #1 and a 2.10-point gain for cases D, E, and F in group #2. Conclusions Our study shows that HF simulation learning significantly increases ECNi-like test results when compared with traditional forms."
Widening the lens on teaching and assessing clinical reasoning: from in the head to out in the world,DIAGNOSIS,"Traditional teaching and assessment of clinical reasoning has focused on the individual clinician because of the preeminence of the information processing (IP) theory perspective. The clinician's mind has been viewed as the main source of effective or ineffective reasoning, and other participants, the environment and their interactions have been largely ignored. A social cognitive theoretical lens could enhance our understanding of how reasoning and error and the environment are linked. Therefore, a new approach in which the clinical reasoning process is situated and examined within the context may be required. The theories of embodied cognition, ecological psychology, situated cognition (SitCog) and distributed cognition (DCog) offer new insights to help the teacher and assessor enhance the quality of clinical reasoning instruction and assessment. We describe the teaching and assessment implications of clinical reasoning and error through the lens of this family of theories. Direct observation in different contexts focused on individual and team performance, simulation (with or without enhancement of technology), stimulated recall, think-aloud, and modeling are examples of teaching and assessment strategies grounded in this family of social cognitive theories. Educators may consider the instructional design of learning environments and educational tools that promote a situated educational approach to the teaching and assessment of clinical reasoning."
Twelve tips to support the development of clinical reasoning skills using virtual patient cases,MEDICAL TEACHER,"Clinical reasoning is a critical core competency in medical education. Strategies to support the development of clinical reasoning skills have focused on methodologies used in traditional settings, including lectures, small groups, activities within Simulation Centers and the clinical arena. However, the evolving role and growing utilization of virtual patients (VPs) in undergraduate medical education; as well as an increased emphasis on blended learning, multi-modal models that include VPs in core curricula; suggest a growing requirement for strategies or guidelines that directly focus on VPs. The authors have developed 12 practical tips that can be used in VP cases to support the development of clinical reasoning. These are based on teaching strategies and principles of instructional design and pedagogy, already used to teach and assess clinical reasoning in other settings. Their application within VPs will support educators who author or use VP cases that promote the development of clinical reasoning."
"Embedded, In Situ Simulation Improves Ability to Rescue",CLINICAL SIMULATION IN NURSING,"Background: A gap exists in providing simulation that incorporates the complexity of a typical work day and its effect on patient safety. Methods: As part of a quality improvement project for the education of all nurses on a regular inpatient medical-surgical unit, nursing education facilitators embedded a standardized patient scenario into the typical work environment to help nurses understand how to safely prioritize a difficult care situation while managing their entire workload during a full shift. Results: Using this embedded real-time simulation, nurse educators were able to determine nurses did not consistently recognize subtle signs of clinical deterioration in a patient with a spinal cord injury. Nursing staff reported an increase in knowledge and comfort with spinal cord injury and activation of rapid response at the end of the simulation. Conclusion: Clinical decision-making appears to be less effective when subtle patient-assessment findings are collected and interpreted over time in the presence of a full patient assignment being cared for by a variety of caregivers. Understanding how nurses work within their typical environment opens the door for innovative approaches to designing future simulation education and hospital-based process changes that create safer environments for patients."
"A major trauma course based on posters, audio-guides and simulation improves the management skills of medical students: Evaluation via medical simulator",ANAESTHESIA CRITICAL CARE & PAIN MEDICINE,"Background: Medical competence requires the acquisition of theoretical knowledge and technical skills. Severe trauma management teaching is poorly developed during internship. Nevertheless, the basics of major trauma management should be acquired by every future physician. For this reason, the major trauma course (MTC), an educational course in major traumatology, has been developed for medical students. Our objective was to evaluate, via a high fidelity medical simulator, the impact of the MTC on medical student skills concerning major trauma management. Methods: The MTC contains 3 teaching modalities: posters with associated audio-guides, a procedural workshop on airway management and a teaching session using a medical simulator. Skills evaluation was performed 1 month before (step 1) and 1 month after (step 3) the MTC (step 2). Nineteen students were individually evaluated on 2 different major trauma scenarios. The primary endpoint was the difference between steps 1 and 3, in a combined score evaluating: admission, equipment, monitoring and safety (skill set 1) and systematic clinical examinations (skill set 2). Results: After the course, the combined primary outcome score improved by 47% (P < 0.01). Scenario choice or the order of use had no significant influence on the skill set evaluations. Conclusion: This study shows improvement in student skills for major trauma management, which we attribute mainly to the major trauma course developed in our institution.

Effectiveness of a Simulation Curriculum on Clinical Application A Randomized Educational Trial,SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE-JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE,"Introduction The use of simulation to develop clinical reasoning and medical decision-making skills for common events is poorly established. Validated head trauma rules help identify children at low risk for clinically important traumatic brain injury and guide the need for neuroimaging. We predicted that interns trained using a high-fidelity, immersive simulation would understand and apply these rules better than those trained using a case-based discussion. Our primary outcomes were to determine the effectiveness of a single targeted intervention on an intern's ability to learn and apply the rules. Methods This was a prospective randomized controlled trial. Interns were randomized to participate in either a manikin-based simulation or a case discussion. Knowledge and application of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network Head Trauma tool were assessed both under testing conditions using standardized vignettes and in clinical encounters. In both settings, interns completed a validated assessment tool to test their knowledge and application of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network Head Trauma tool when assessing patients with head injury. Results Under testing conditions, both being in the simulation group and shorter time from training were independently associated with higher score under testing conditions using standardized vignettes (P = 0.038 and P < 0.001), but not with clinical encounters. Conclusions Interns exposed to manikin-based simulation training demonstrated performance competencies that are better than those in the case discussion group under testing conditions using standardized vignettes, but not in real clinical encounters. This study suggests that information delivery and comprehension may be improved through a single targeted simulation-based education."
Robustness Evaluation of Computer-aided Clinical Trials for Medical Devices,ICCPS '19: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2019 10TH ACM/IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS,"Medical cyber-physical systems, such as the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), require evaluation of safety and efficacy in the context of a patient population in a clinical trial. Advances in computer modeling and simulation allow for generation of a simulated cohort or virtual cohort which mimics a patient population and can be used as a source of prior information. A major obstacle to acceptance of simulation results as a source of prior information is the lack of a framework for explicitly modeling sources of uncertainty in simulation results and quantifying the effect on trial outcomes. In this work, we formulate the Computer-Aided Clinical Trial (CACT) within a Bayesian statistical framework allowing explicit modeling of assumptions and utilization of simulation results at all stages of a clinical trial. To quantify the robustness of the CACT outcome with respect to a simulation assumption, we define delta-robustness as the minimum perturbation of the base prior distribution resulting in a change of the CACT outcome and provide a method to estimate the d-robustness. We demonstrate the utility of the framework and how the results of d-robustness evaluation can be utilized at various stages of a clinical trial through an application to the Rhythm ID Goes Head-to-head Trial (RIGHT), which was a comparative evaluation of the safety and efficacy of specific software algorithms across different implantable cardiac devices. Finally, we introduce a hardware interface that allows for direct interaction with the physical device in order to validate and confirm the results of a CACT for implantable cardiac devices."

The importance of theory and method: A brief reflection on an innovative program of research examining how situational factors influence physicians' clinical reasoning,FASEB BIOADVANCES,"Clinical reasoning, a complex process that involves gathering and synthesizing information to make diagnostic and treatment decisions, is a topic researchers frequently study to mitigate errors. Scientific reasoning has several similarities with clinical reasoning, including the need to generate hypotheses; observe, gather, and interpret evidence; engage in the process of elimination; draw conclusions; and refine and test new hypotheses. However, researchers have only recently begun to take into consideration the role that situational factors (also known as contextual factors), such as language barriers or the lack of diagnostic test results, can play in diagnostic error. Additionally, questions remain about the best ways to teach these complex processes."
Clinical simulation: measuring the efficacy of training,CURRENT OPINION IN ANESTHESIOLOGY,"Purpose of review Simulation is frequently cited as the ideal method to improve the training of health care professionals. Studies from specialties such as anesthesia and intensive care report that life-sized mannequins reliably measure acute care skills. Task trainers, such as laparoscopic simulators, effectively improve participants' ability to perform minimally invasive surgery. This review will chart the progress made in defining the role of simulation training in medical education. Recent findings Trainees who use high-fidelity task trainers (such as the laparoscopic simulators) avoided complications and errors associated with inexperience when compared with peers. Residents' skill in managing acute events can be objectively and reliably measured in a simulation laboratory. Summary Task trainers are recommended for training physicians for a number of minimally invasive procedures. Life-sized mannequins can be used to train residents to manage a range of critical events in a simulated setting. These exercises train residents to conduct a sequential, logical examination, perform various tasks, interpret clinical findings and use clinical reasoning to resolve the simulated crisis."
Simulation in physiotherapy students for clinical decisions during interaction with people with low back pain: randomised controlled trial,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background: Low back pain (LBP) is a condition with a high global prevalence, which is getting health professionals' attention, including physiotherapists as they must have the skills to provide treatment that increases the patient's quality of life. Clinical simulations could be a pedagogic strategy that facilitates adequate training for students to acquire skills to improve their professional reasoning in this clinical situation. Objective: This study sought to determine the effects of clinical simulations with simulated patients (SP) on the physiotherapy students' clinical decision-making within a role-playing (RP) scenario while caring of LBP patients. Methods: This experimental study included 42 participants from two Colombian universities, randomized into two groups (SP, n = 21; RP, n = 21). The clinical skill of performing the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE-LBP) was evaluated while students cared for patients with LBP; after that, a pedagogical method was conducted that included clinical simulation and, finally, the OSCE-LBP was applied again to compare both groups. Results Changes occurred in the OSCE-LBP among both groups of students: the scores increased (0.66 and 0.59 in RP and SP, respectively), and neither of the two was superior (p value 0.01; 95%CI - 0.21 to 0.23). Conclusion: Both types of simulation favor decision-making in professional reasoning in physiotherapy students during interactions with individuals with LBP."
COMPUTER-ASSISTED-INSTRUCTION IMPROVES CLINICAL REASONING SKILLS OF DIETETICS STUDENTS,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN DIETETIC ASSOCIATION,"Objective The effects of a computer-assisted instruction (CAI) tutorial program on learning clinical reasoning skills were compared in undergraduate dietetics students. Design A drill-and-practice program to control for time on task, a tutorial program, and a simulation program, as the test vehicle, were developed. The tutorial and simulation programs presented data on a patient with cardiovascular disease. Setting Subjects were tested in 30 undergraduate dietetics programs. Subjects Participants were 413 undergraduate diet therapy students enrolled in a coordinated program in dietetics (CPD) or a didactic program in dietetics (DPD). Intervention After completion of lectures on cardiovascular disease, subjects were given the drill-and-practice program plus a simulation test (group I), the tutorial plus a simulation test (group 2), or the simulation test only (group 3). Main outcome measures Scores on the simulation test were compared. Variables included type of CAI, dietetics program, year in school, computer experience, and experience using a medical chart. Mastery of objectives related to lower- and higher-level clinical reasoning skills introduced in the tutorial program was compared. Statistical analysis One-may analysis of variance and Student-Newman Keuls tests were conducted to determine any differences among the three groups. Reliability was determined using the Kuder-Richardson Formula 20. Results The reliability coefficient of the simulation test was 0.93. Group 2 scored higher on the simulation test than group 1 or group 3. As a group, the CPD students scored higher than the DPD students. When CPD and DPD students were divided into the three experimental groups, there was no significant difference between the CPD and DPD student simulation scores. Group 2 mastered all objectives for lower-level reasoning skills and the higher-level decision-making objective better than groups 1 and 3. Applications/conclusions A computer tutorial program enhanced clinical reasoning skills in undergraduate dietetics students. This type of program could be used to supplement many topics taught in diet therapy and provide DPD students with experiential learning before their clinical intern practicums."
"The impact of deliberate reflection with WISE-MD (TM) modules on surgical clerkship students' critical thinking: a prospective, randomized controlled pilot study",ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND PRACTICE,"Purpose: Critical thinking underlies several Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC)-defined core entrustable professional activities (EPAs). Critical-thinking ability affects health care quality and safety. Tested tools to teach, assess, improve, and nurture good critical-thinking skills are needed. This prospective randomized controlled pilot study evaluated the addition o f deliberate reflection (DR), guidance with Web Initiative in Surgical Education (WISE-MD (TM)) modules, to promote surgical clerks' critical-thinking ability. The goal was to promote the application of reflective awareness principles to enhance learning outcomes and critical thinking about the module content. Participants and methods: Surgical clerkship (SC) students were recruited from two different blocks and randomly assigned to a control or intervention group. The intervention group was asked to record responses using a DR guide as they viewed two selected WISE-MD (TM) modules while the control group was asked to view two modules recording free thought. We hypothesized that the intervention group would show a significantly greater pre- to postintervention increase in critical-thinking ability than students in the control group. Results: Neither group showed a difference in pre- and posttest free-thought critical-thinking outcomes; however, the intervention group verbalized more thoughtful clinical reasoning during the intervention. Conclusion: Despite an unsupported hypothesis, this study provides a forum for discussion in medical education. It took a sponsored tool in surgical education (WISE-MD (TM)) and posed the toughest evaluation criteria of an educational intervention; does it affect the way we think? and not just what we learn, but how we learn it? The answer is significant and will require more resources before we arrive at a definitive answer."
Teaching Diagnostic Reasoning to Advanced Practice Nurses: Positives and Negatives,CLINICAL SIMULATION IN NURSING,"Many nurses transitioning to advanced practice roles struggle in gaining competence in diagnostic reasoning, a core skill requiring integration and application of complex patient data. Diagnostic error, a common cause of medical error, is often a result of faulty interpretation, synthesis, or judgment of available information. Nurse educators, confronted with decreased clinical site availability, shifts to online education, and emerging learning pedagogies are increasingly challenged in facilitating student acquisition of diagnostic reasoning skills. This article presents an overview of strategies and lessons learned by primary and acute care nurse practitioner faculty in attempts to improve student competence in diagnostic reasoning."
Is Research in Simulation as Accessible as Traditional Clinical Research? A Review of the 'Association for Simulated Practice in Healthcare' Conference,CUREUS,"Background Meta-analysis of simulation teaching has shown to be an effective teaching methodology. The Association for Simulated Practice in Healthcare (ASPIH) annual international, multidisciplinary conference is recognised as the leading UK meeting for simulation-based education. We hypothesise that simulation-based research presented at this conference is currently less accessible than more traditional clinical research presentations. Method We reviewed the abstracts of all research presented at the 5th ASPIH Conference, 2014 and then utilised the Bhandari methodology to assess whether an abstract had subsequently been published in a peer review journal. Our secondary aim was to assess for recurring themes that may predict publication. Results Twenty-seven of 197 (14%) abstracts presented at the 2014 meeting were subsequently published. The mean lead time to publication from the conference was 23 (2 - 61) months. Two positive predictive factors for publication were oral presentations (vs poster), and a Kirkpatrick level above 1. Conclusion The publication rate for abstracts from respected clinical conferences is 30%, but the publication rate for ASPIH abstracts is significantly below this. The potential reasons for this may include a lack of simulation specific journals. Authors should aim to publish simulation-based research in peer reviewed publications to help progress the role and the value of simulation in medical education."
Development and evaluation of clinical reasoning using 'think aloud' approach in pharmacy undergraduates - A mixed-methods study,SAUDI PHARMACEUTICAL JOURNAL,"Introduction: Given the widespread use of clinical reasoning (CR) in the healthcare practice, it is essential to inculcate the CR practice in undergraduate pharmacy education which can not only facilitate their clinical education and clinical rotations but can also help them become better clinical pharmacists. There is very limited CR employed in the pharmacy curriculum and practice in the Middle East countries. This study aimed to develop and evaluate CR practice in pharmacy undergraduates in one college of pharmacy in Saudi Arabia. Methods: We employed a mixed-methods methodology that included two phases. In Phase I, students were introduced to CR practice ('think aloud' method) and given geriatric clinical cases which they used in two sessions together with a tutor. This was followed by the writing of SOAP notes using the tutor feedback and completion of a survey that included a self-reflection about their experience of using the CR method. Phase II included face-to-face semi-structured interviews involving selected students that were recruited via convenience sampling to further explore the issues identified in Phase I of the study. Results: Of the 155 students who completed the survey (response rate 94%), the majority of them agreed that CR using the 'think aloud' method was useful in gathering (92%) and interpreting (95%) relevant patient information, identifying medication-related problems (95%), exploring therapeutic options for the problem(s) (93%) and formulating a treatment plan for the patient (90%). Qualitative data analysis of the 12 interviews was consistent with these findings. Furthermore, it provided an insight into the challenges faced by the students in applying this CR method. Conclusions: Students found the practice of CR using the 'think aloud' method helpful in working through given cases and taking clinical decisions. This method can be widely employed in pharmacy education and practice. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

Piloting Virtual Surgical Patient Cases with 3rd-year medical students during the surgery rotation,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY,"BACKGROUND: Surgical education programs are increasingly challenged to make medical students' learning experiences in their surgery rotation meaningful while making the most of limited faculty resources and maximizing patient safety. Simulations and virtual environments are potential resources for providing meaningful clinical learning experiences. METHODS: Ninety-eight 3rd-year medical students used the Virtual Surgical Patient Cases software as a part of their surgery clerkship. We used a mixed-methods approach to data collection and analyses to investigate how students and faculty engaged with cases as teaching and learning tools. RESULTS: Students improved their clinical reasoning skills significantly at each case attempt, but made some errors consistently across attempts. Faculty used the information provided about students' decisions during the cases to guide their teaching during case discussions. CONCLUSIONS: Including more cases in the surgical clerkship could allow students additional practice with making diagnoses and facilitate an interactive role in discussing cases with faculty.

Understanding the Assessment of Clinical Reasoning,ASSESSING COMPETENCE IN PROFESSIONAL PERFORMANCE ACROSS DISCIPLINES AND PROFESSIONS,"Clinical reasoning assessment is an essential component of determining a health professional's competence. Clinical reasoning cannot be assessed directly. It must be gleaned from a health professional's choices and decisions. Clinical knowledge and knowledge organization, rather than a general problem solving process, serve as the substrate for clinical reasoning ability. Unfortunately, the lack of a gold standard for the clinical reasoning process and the observation of context specificity make it difficult to assess clinical reasoning. Information processing theory, which focuses on the way the brain processes and organizes knowledge, has provided valuable insights into the cognitive psychology of diagnostic and therapeutic reasoning but failed to explain the variance in health professional's diagnostic performance. Situativity theory has emerged suggesting that this variance relates to context-specific factors that impact a health professional's clinical reasoning performance. Both information processing and situativity theory inform the way in which we assess clinical reasoning. Current assessment methods focus on standardized testing of knowledge to maximize psychometric parameters and work-based assessments which evaluate clinical reasoning under authentic, uncertain conditions that can decrease the reliability of these measurements. Issues of inter-rater reliability and context specificity require that multiple raters assess multiple encounters in multiple contexts to optimize validity and reliability. No single assessment method can assess all aspects of clinical reasoning; therefore, in order to improve the quality of assessments of clinical reasoning ability, different combinations of methods that measure different components of the clinical reasoning process are needed."
The validity of performance-based measures of clinical reasoning and alternative approaches,MEDICAL EDUCATION,"The development of a valid and reliable measure of clinical reasoning ability is a prerequisite to advancing our understanding of clinically relevant cognitive processes and to improving clinical education. A record of problem-solving performances within standardised and computerised patient simulations is often implicitly assumed to reflect clinical reasoning skills. However, the validity of this measurement method for assessing clinical reasoning is open to question. Explicitly defining the intended clinical reasoning construct should help researchers critically evaluate current performance score interpretations. Although case-specific measurement outcomes (i.e. low correlations between cases) have led medical educators to endorse performance-based assessments of problem solving as a method of measuring clinical reasoning, the matter of low across-case generalisation is a reliability issue with validity implications and does not necessarily support a performance-based approach. Given this, it is important to critically examine whether our current performance-based testing efforts are correctly focused. To design a valid educational assessment of clinical reasoning requires a coherent argument represented as a chain of inferences supporting a clinical reasoning interpretation. Suggestions are offered for assessing how well an examinee's existing knowledge organisation accommodates the integration of new patient information, and for focusing assessments on an examinee's understanding of how new patient information changes case-related probabilities and base rates."
Medical Image Three-Dimensional Simulation Technology in Hospital Clinical Practice,SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING,"We performed three-dimensional reconstruction of facial CT scan images of patients with mandibular angle hypertrophy to explore the related factors of mandibular angle hypertrophy. At the same time, the article uses the results of three-dimensional reconstruction to simulate the clinical operation and obtain the final operation method. It was found that all patients were able to obtain the proper surgical plan from the three-dimensional reconstructed images and can get the hypertrophy factor of the mandibular angle. For this reason, we conclude that computer reconstruction simulation technology can obtain the tissue changes before and after osteotomy of mandibular angle hypertrophy and get the cause of hypertrophy. Three-dimensional reconstruction simulation technology is the best auxiliary diagnosis plan for the selection of mandibular angle surgery."

Repeated Exposure to High-fidelity Simulation and Nursing Interns' Clinical Performance: Impact on Practice Readiness,CLINICAL SIMULATION IN NURSING,"Background: From the feedback of clinical preceptors and staff nurses, one of the reasons why students are not given the opportunity to practice hands-on with their patients in hospitals is because of the lack of practice in performing nursing procedures during their clinical placements. This study was conducted to improve students' clinical performance and readiness to practice. Methods: An experimental research design was used, and a randomized controlled trial was conducted. The clinical performance of nursing interns was evaluated by dividing them into group A (simultaneous high-fidelity simulation exposure along with hands-on clinical training) and group B (pure hands-on clinical training). Results: The mean grade obtained by group A was significantly higher by an average of 13.89 points than that obtained by group B. HFS exposure and clinical performance are significantly correlated. Conclusions: Incorporating HFS as a supplemental component of hands-on training can enhance nurses' performance. Repeated exposure to HFS facilitates proficiency and practice readiness.

The Challenging Case Conference: A Gamified Approach to Clinical Reasoning in the Video Conference Era,WESTERN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE,"The development of clinical reasoning abilities is a core competency of emergency medicine (EM) resident education and has historically been accomplished through case conferences and clinical learning. The advent of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has fundamentally changed these traditional learning opportunities by causing a nationwide reliance on virtual education environments and reducing the clinical diversity of cases encountered by EM trainees. We propose an innovative case conference that combines low-fidelity simulation with elements of gamification to foster the development of clinical reasoning skills and increase engagement among trainees during a virtual conference. After a team of residents submits a real clinical case that challenged their clinical reasoning abilities, a different team of residents plays through a gamified, simulated version of the case live on a video conference call. The case concludes with a facilitated debriefing led by a simulation-trained faculty, where both the resident teams and live virtual audience discuss the challenges of the case. Participants described how the Challenging Case Conference improved their perceptions of their clinical reasoning skills. Audience members reported increased engagement compared to traditional conferences. Participants also reported an unexpected, destigmatizing effect on the discussion of medical errors produced by this exercise. Residency programs could consider implementing a similar case conference as a component of their conference curriculum."
High-fidelity simulation in the nonmedical domain: practices and potential transferable competencies for the medical field,ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND PRACTICE,"Simulation is a promising pedagogical tool in the area of medical education. High-fidelity simulators can reproduce realistic environments or clinical situations. This allows for the practice of teamwork and communication skills, thereby enhancing reflective reasoning and experiential learning. Use of high-fidelity simulators is not limited to the medical and aeronautical fields, but has developed in a large number of nonmedical organizations as well. The techniques and pedagogical tools which have evolved through the use of nonmedical simulations serve not only as teaching examples but also as avenues which can help further the evolution of the concept of high-fidelity simulation in the field of medicine. This paper presents examples of high-fidelity simulations in the military, maritime, and aeronautical fields. We compare the implementation of high-fidelity simulation in the medical and nonmedical domains, and discuss the possibilities and limitations of simulators in medicine, based on recent nonmedical applications."
Measurement of clinical reflective capacity early in training as a predictor of clinical reasoning performance at the end of residency: an experimental study on the script concordance test,MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background The script concordance (SC) test was conceived to measure knowledge organization, the presence of links between items of knowledge which allow for interpretation of data in clinical decision making situations. Earlier studies have shown that the SC test has good psychometric qualities and overcomes some of the limitations of simulation clinical testing. This study explores the predictive validity of the test. Objectives To verify whether scores obtained by students at the end of clerkship predict their clinical reasoning performance at the end of residency. Design Comparison of scores obtained on a SC test taken at the end of clerkship with those obtained 2 years later at the end of residency on two clinical reasoning assessments of known validity, called the short-answer management problems (SAMPs) and the simulated office orals (SOOs), and an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) aimed at assessing hands-on skills and clinical reasoning. Data were treated by Pearson correlation analysis. Subjects and setting A cohort of 24 students from a medical school in Quebec was followed up to the end of their residency in family medicine, completed in several schools across Quebec. Results The observed Pearson correlation coefficients of the SC test were statistically significant (0.451, P = 0.013; 0.447; P = 0.015) when compared with the SAMPs and the SOOs, respectively. They were not statistically significant (0.340, P = 0.052) when compared with the OSCE. Conclusion The authors assumed that thr richness of knowledge organization, as indicated by SC test scores, would predict part of the performance on the measures of clinical reasoning (SAMP and SOO), but would predict less well performance on the OSCE which measures both clinical skills and clinical reasoning. Data found in the study an coherent with this hypothesis. This is evidence in favour of the construct validity of the SC test. It also indicates that, in the context of certification assessment, if a candidate has shown good organization of clinical knowledge at an early point in training, it can be expected that he/she will show good organization at subsequent measurements of this kind of knowledge. This appears to be true even if the later measures bear on a wider clinical domain."
"A Framework for Designing, Implementing, and Sustaining a National Simulation Network Building Incentive-Based Network Structures and Iterative Processes for Long-Term Success: The Case of the Medical Council of Canada's Qualifying Examination, Part II",SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE-JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE,"The use of networks for sharing and distributing information, for institutional collaboration, and action programs is commonplace. In 1989, the Medical Council of Canada began the implementation of a national clinical licensing examination to assess physicians for practice skills and decision making using standardized or simulated patients in an Objective Structured Clinical Examination format. Once fully implemented, the examination was administered through a network of medical schools at 16 locations across Canada in two languages twice yearly. That network has functioned successfully for 17 years. This article reviews the literature and examines the reasons and incentives for the long-term sustainability of the network. Based on that assessment, a framework is presented for analyzing, designing, and sustaining a national simulation network. It emphasizes the need for an iterative approach and identifies the success factors that can facilitate the adoption of a national simulation network for use in professional credentialing and licensure.

"Team planning discussion and clinical performance: a prospective, randomised, controlled simulation trial",ANAESTHESIA,"Planning held before emergency management of a critical situation might be an invaluable asset for optimising team preparation. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a brief planning discussion improved team performance in a simulated critical care situation. Forty-four pairs of trainees in anaesthesia and intensive care were randomly allocated to either an intervention or control group before participating in a standardised simulated scenario. Twelve different scenarios were utilised. Groups were stratified by postgraduate year and simulated scenario, and a facilitator was embedded in the scenario. In the intervention group, the pairs had an oral briefing followed by a 4-min planning discussion before starting the simulation. The primary end-point was clinical performance, as rated by two independent blinded assessors on a score of 0-100 using video records and pre-established scenario-specific checklists. Crisis resource management and stress response (cognitive appraisal ratio) were also assessed. Two pairs were excluded for technical reasons. Clinical performance scores were higher in the intervention group; mean (SD) 51 (9) points vs. 46 (9) in the control group, p = 0.039. The planning discussion was also associated with higher crisis resource management scores and lower cognitive appraisal ratios, reflecting a positive response. A 4-min planning discussion before a simulated critical care situation improved clinical team performance and cognitive appraisal ratios. Team planning should be integrated into medical education and clinical practice."
"Teaching clinical reasoning and decision-making skills to nursing students: Design, development, and usability evaluation of a serious game",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS,"Background: Serious games (SGs) are a type of simulation technology that may provide nursing students with the opportunity to practice their clinical reasoning and decision-making skills in a safe and authentic environment. Despite the growing number of SGs developed for healthcare professionals, few SGs are video based or address the domain of home health care. Aims: This paper aims to describe the design, development, and usability evaluation of a video based SG for teaching clinical reasoning and decision-making skills to nursing students who care for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in home healthcare settings. Methods: A prototype SG was developed. A unified framework of usability called TURF (Task, User, Representation, and Function) and SG theory were employed to ensure a user-centered design. The educational content was based on the clinical decision-making model, Bloom's taxonomy, and a Bachelor of Nursing curriculum. A purposeful sample of six participants evaluated the SG prototype in a usability laboratory. Cognitive walkthrough evaluations, a questionnaire, and individual interviews were used for the usability evaluation. The data were analyzed using qualitative deductive content analysis based on the TURF framework elements and related usability heuristics. Results: The SG was perceived as being realistic, clinically relevant, and at an adequate level of complexity for the intended users. Usability issues regarding functionality and the user-computer interface design were identified. However, the SG was perceived as being easy to learn, and participants suggested that the SG could serve as a supplement to traditional training in laboratory and clinical settings. Conclusions: Using video based scenarios with an authentic COPD patient and a home healthcare registered nurse as actors contributed to increased realism. Using different theoretical approaches in the SG design was considered an advantage of the design process. The SG was perceived as being useful, usable, and satisfying. The achievement of the desired functionality and the minimization of user-computer interface issues emphasize the importance of conducting a usability evaluation during the SG development process.

The virtual patient as a learning tool: a mixed quantitative qualitative study,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,"BackgroundThe use of simulation in medical education has been widely accepted. There are different types of medical simulators that vary in both accuracy to emulate the real world (fidelity) and cost of development or acquisition. There is significant evidence that supports the use of high-fidelity simulators (i.e. mannequins or dummies) to prepare students for clinical environments, less attention has been given to low-fidelity simulators. This article aims to present evidence regarding the effectiveness of a low-fidelity simulator: Virtual Patient (VP), which develops several interactive computer-based clinical scenarios, seeking to promote an alternative learning environment and the development of necessary medical skills such as clinical reasoning in students of medicine.MethodsA quasi-experimental study was designed to investigate the results on the development of history taking and clinical reasoning skills in a group of undergraduate medical students, in a course devised under the concepts of constructivism in education, which used the Virtual Patient as the fundamental teaching tool. Results were measured through a mixed, quantitative and qualitative study, triangulating the results of the students' skills evaluation when facing a clinical case represented by an actor patient before and after the course. Additionally, the description of the students' and tool's performance was measured by way of a qualitative study.ResultsThe comparison of the students' skills on the evaluation matrix before-and-after the course evidenced a statistically significant advance (p<0.01) in all aspects (interview, physical exam, clinical judgment, relevance of medical exams, and presentation of case). Students described the VP as an easy-to-use and motivating tool for learning without stress, especially at the beginning of their career. VP allowed them to create logical and structured processes, to be wrong without consequences, and to review and reassess information available. From the professor perspective, it allowed a better follow-up of the students' learning process and favored reflections on the teaching-learning process.ConclusionsVP proved to be a valuable and useful tool for the development of clinical reasoning and history taking skills in medical students, as part of a constructivist learning course."
Student perception of the educational model based on simulation,ARCHIVOS DE MEDICINA,"Objective: to assess perception of the students on a simulation-based educational model, in a private medical school located at the municipality of Medellin, Colombia, regarding with their ability to perform in real clinical scenarios. Materials and methods: a cross sectional study. Sample were medical students from IV to the XIII academic period. Data was collected from primary sources, through the design and application of a questionnaire. Results: the sample included were 300 students during their clinical practices and clerkship, the mean age was 21.9 years. 68.3% (205) of the sample were female. We assess the level of satisfaction with the experience of using clinical simulation; 65.3% (n=196) described the experience as satisfactory, 2% (n=6) and 23% (n=69) as unsatisfactory and moderately satisfactory respectively; remaining participants described the experience as full satisfactory. Regarding the perception of the competences developed under the simulation-based education model, the main ones were 98% (n=294) clinical reasoning and 95% (n=285) decision making. Conclusion: surveyed students perceived that simulation facilitates learning by making possible the development of skills such as teamwork and communication, which generates a high degree of satisfaction in students regarding their training process."
Teaching Medical Students Clinical Anesthesia,ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA,"There are many reasons for evaluating our approach and improving our teaching of America's future doctors, whether they become anesthesiologists (recruitment) or participate in patient management in the perioperative period (general patient care). Teaching medical students the seminal aspects of any medical specialty is a continual challenge. Although no definitive curricula or single clinical approach has been defined, certain key features can be ascertained from clinical experience and the literature. A survey was conducted among US anesthesiology teaching programs regarding the teaching content and approaches currently used to teach US medical students clinical anesthesia. Using the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education website that lists 133 accredited anesthesiology programs, residency directors were contacted via e-mail. Based on those responses and follow-up phone calls, teaching representatives from 125 anesthesiology departments were identified and asked via e-mail to complete a survey. The survey was returned by 85 programs, yielding a response rate of 68% of individuals contacted and 63% of all departments. Ninety-one percent of the responding departments teach medical students, most in the final 2 years of medical school. Medical student exposure to clinical anesthesia occurred as elective only at 42% of the institutions, was requirement only at 16% of responding institutions, and the remainder had both elective and required courses. Anesthesiology faculty at 43% of the responding institutions reported teaching in the preclinical years of medical school, primarily in the departments of pharmacology and physiology. Forty-five percent of programs reported interdisciplinary teaching with other departments teaching classes such as gross anatomy. There is little exposure of anesthesiology faculty to medical students in other general courses. Teaching in the operating room is the primary teaching method in the clinical years. Students are allowed full access to patient care, including performing history and physical examinations, participating in the insertion of IVs and airway management. Simulation-based teaching was used by 82% of programs during medical student anesthesia clerkships. Sixty-eight percent of respondents reported that they have no formal training for their anesthesiology faculty teachers, 51% stated that they do not receive nonclinical time to teach, and 38% of respondents stated that they received some form of remuneration for teaching medical students, primarily nonclinical time. This article presents a summary of these survey results, provides a historical review of previous evaluations of teaching medical students clinical anesthesia, and discusses the contributions of anesthesiologists to medical student education."
Comparing Nurse Practitioner Student Diagnostic Reasoning Outcomes in Telehealth and Face-to-Face Standardized Patient Encounters,JOURNAL OF NURSING REGULATION,"Introduction: Standardized patient (SP) encounters support development of nurse practitioner (NP) students' diagnostic reasoning ability in a uniquely authentic way. Telehealth technologies present an opportunity to increase access to SP experiences. Aim: We evaluated NP students' diagnostic reasoning performance in telehealth-enabled SP encounters (TSPEs) compared to face-to-face SP encounters (FSPEs). Methods: This study used a randomized, crossover design. A convenience sample of 41 participants were assigned to one of four treatment groups: FSPE/pneumonia first, TSPE/pneumonia first, FSPE/asthma first, or TSPE/asthma first. Faculty evaluators used the Diagnostic Reasoning Assessment (DRA) to rate students' observed diagnostic reasoning performance and SOAP (subjective, objective, assessment, and plan) notes and assessed whether their diagnoses were correct. Results: There were no significant differences in students' DRA scores or ability to make the correct diagnosis between TSPE and FSPE. However, a sequence effect was noted for DRA score. Students who experienced TSPE first had significantly lower DRA scores than on their subsequent FSPE encounters. In addition, both sequence of cases and sequence of encounters had a significant effect on students' ability to make the correct diagnosis. Students who experienced either asthma or FSPE first were more likely to obtain the right diagnosis. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that students can demonstrate equivalent diagnostic reasoning in TSPEs and FSPEs. Future research should investigate the effectiveness of TSPEs in different settings to teach and assess varied clinical practice competencies with diverse groups of NP students."
A computer simulation designed for problem-based learning,MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Objectives As problem-based learning is increasingly used in medical education, there is a growing need to capture the diversity of the events occurring during problem-based learning sessions in order to understand the way in which students learn. The computer simulation described attempts to analyse a posteriori how students reason and learn during such sessions. Design A computer simulation was designed to perform a detailed analysis of the following features: pattern of information searched, formulation of working hypothesis and identification of learning issues. The program, which has been running successfully for 2 years, was developed using local resources and accepts any clinical problem, provided it is written in a suitable text file format. The program has been applied in the discipline of pathophysiology. Setting Faculty of Medical Sciences of Lisbon, Portugal. Subjects Medical students. Results An example is presented of how prints were analysed in order to evaluate the 'progression profile' of the students, and a comparison is made with other similar instruments. Conclusions The program improved understanding of the relationships between the inquiry strategy and hypothesis formulation and also of how self-learning (triggered by learning issues) influenced further analysis of the cases."
Simulation-based medical education: An ethical imperative,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,"Medical training must at some point use live patients to hone the skills of health professionals. But there is also an obligation to provide optimal treatment and to ensure patients' safety and well-being. Balancing these two needs represents a fundamental ethical tension in medical education. Simulation-based learning can help mitigate this tension by developing health professionals' knowledge, skills, and attitudes while protecting patients from unnecessary risk. Simulation-based training has been institutionalized in other high-hazard professions, such as aviation, nuclear power, and the military, to maximize training safety and minimize risk. Health care has lagged behind in simulation applications for a number of reasons, including cost, lack of rigorous proof of effect, and resistance to change. Recently, the international patient safety movement and the U.S. federal policy agenda have created a receptive atmosphere for expanding the use of simulators in medical training, stressing the ethical imperative to first do no harm in the face of validated, large epidemiological studies describing unacceptable preventable injuries to patients as a result of medical management. Four themes provide a framework for an ethical analysis of simulation-based medical education: best standards of care and training, error management and patient safety, patient autonomy, and social justice and resource allocation. These themes are examined from the perspectives of patients, learners, educators, and society. The use of simulation wherever feasible conveys a critical educational and ethical message to all: patients are to be protected whenever possible and they are not commodities to be used as conveniences of training."
Outcomes of Irish graduate entry medical student engagement with self-directed learning of clinical skills,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background: Existing literature is mixed as to whether self-directed learning (SDL) delivers improvements in knowledge, skills or attitudes of medical students compared with traditional learning methods. This study aimed to determine whether there is an association between engagement in SDL and student performance in clinical examinations, the factors that influence student engagement with SDL in clinical skills, and student perceptions of SDL. Methods: A retrospective analysis of electronic records of student bookings of SDL sessions from 2008 to 2010 was performed for students in the pre-clinical years of an Irish Graduate Entry Medical programme to assess their level of engagement with SDL. The extent to which this engagement influenced their performance in subsequent summative examinations was evaluated. A cross-sectional survey of students across the four years of the programme was also conducted to determine student perceptions of SDL and the factors that affect engagement. Results: The level of engagement with SDL decreased over time from 95% of first years in 2008 to 49% of first years in 2010. There was no significant difference between the median exam performance for any clinical skills tested by level of engagement (none, one or more sessions) except for basic life support in first year (p = 0.024). The main reason for engaging with SDL was to practice a clinical skill prior to assessment and the majority of respondents agreed that SDL sessions had improved their performance of the specific clinical skills being practised. Conclusion: Students viewed SDL as an opportunity to practise skills prior to assessment but there were no significant differences in subsequent summative assessment by the level of engagement for most clinical skills."
Thinking in Pharmacy Practice: A Study of Community Pharmacists' Clinical Reasoning in Medication Supply Using the Think-Aloud Method,PHARMACY,"Medication review and supply by pharmacists involves both cognitive and technical skills related to the safety and appropriateness of prescribed medicines. The cognitive ability of pharmacists to recall, synthesise and memorise information is a critical aspect of safe and optimal medicines use, yet few studies have investigated the clinical reasoning and decision-making processes pharmacists use when supplying prescribed medicines. The objective of this study was to examine the patterns and processes of pharmacists' clinical reasoning and to identify the information sources used, when making decisions about the safety and appropriateness of prescribed medicines. Ten community pharmacists participated in a simulation in which they were required to review a prescription and make decisions about the safety and appropriateness of supplying the prescribed medicines to the patient, whilst at the same time thinking aloud about the tasks required. Following the simulation each pharmacist was asked a series of questions to prompt retrospective thinking aloud using video-stimulated recall. The simulated consultation and retrospective interview were recorded and transcribed for thematic analysis. All of the pharmacists made a safe and appropriate supply of two prescribed medicines to the simulated patient. Qualitative analysis identified seven core thinking processes used during the supply process: considering prescription in context, retrieving information, identifying medication-related issues, processing information, collaborative planning, decision making and reflection; and align closely with other health professionals. The insights from this study have implications for enhancing awareness of decision making processes in pharmacy practice and informing teaching and assessment approaches in medication supply."
A RANDOMIZED COMPARISON OF ALTERNATIVE FORMATS FOR CLINICAL SIMULATIONS,MEDICAL DECISION MAKING,"Computer-based clinical simulations for medical education vary widely in structure and format, yet few studies have examined which formats are optimal for particular educational settings. This study is a randomized comparison of the same simulated case in three formats: a pedagogic format offering explicit educational support, a high-fidelity format attempting to model clinical reasoning in the real world, and a problem-solving format that requires students to express specific diagnostic hypotheses. Data were collected from rising third-year medical students using a posttest, attitudinal questionnaire, students' writeups of the case, and log files of students' progress through the simulation. Student performances on all measures differed significantly by format. In general, students using the pedagogic format were more proficient but less efficient. They acquired more information but were able to do proportionately less with it. The results suggest that the format of computer-based simulations is an important educational variable."
System dynamics in medical education: a tool for life,ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION,"A course in system dynamics has been included in the first year of our university's six-year medical curriculum. System Dynamics is a discipline that facilitates the modelling, simulation and analysis of a wide range of problems in terms of two fundamental concepts viz. rates and levels. Many topics encountered in the medical school curriculum, from biochemistry to sociology, can be understood in this way. The course was introduced following a curriculum review process in which it was concluded that knowledge of systems would serve to enhance problem-solving skills and clinical reasoning. The specific characteristics of system dynamics, the widespread use of digital computers, and the availability of suitable software made it possible to introduce the course at this level. The syllabus comprises a brief review of relevant mathematics followed by system dynamics topics taught in the context of examples, which are primarily but not exclusively medical. It is anticipated that this will introduce new thought processes to medical students, including holistic thinking and improved graphical visualisation skills."
Clinical trial simulations in paediatric oncology: A feasibility study from the Innovative Therapies for Children with Cancer Consortium,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER,"Introduction: Paediatric dose-finding studies are challenging to perform due to ethical reasons, the limited number of available patients and restricted number of blood samples. In certain cases, the adult pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure can be used as target for dose finding in paediatrics. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of a paediatric phase I dose-finding clinical trial in silico. Methods: Using an adult pharmacokinetic model, clinical trial simulations were performed to determine the power of a proposed clinical trial design. Power was defined as the fraction of 1000 trials with an area under the plasma concentrationetime curve at steady-state (AUC024, SS) within +/- 20% of the adult geometric mean AUC0-24, SS. Different scenarios were compared to optimise the design of the trial. To show the potential of this framework for similar compounds, the current simulation method was also evaluated with adult and paediatric data from literature on sunitinib. Results: At the starting dose of 300 mg/m(2), the power of the trial design was 66.9%. Power did not improve by dose escalation to 350 mg/m(2) (65.3%). Power increased to 78.9% with inclusion of 10 patients per trial. Paediatric sunitinib PK data were adequately predicted from adultdata with a mean prediction error of 1.80%. Conclusion: The performance of PK-based clinical trials in paediatrics can be predicted and optimised through PK modelling and simulation. Application of this approach enables clinical trials in paediatrics to be performed as efficiently as possible while protecting the child from unnecessary harm. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Curricular integration of virtual patients: a unifying perspective of medical teachers and students,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background Virtual Patients (VPs) may improve cognitive and behavioral skills better than traditional methods do. The aim of this paper was to investigate challenges faced by teachers and students in order to effectively implement VPs across undergraduate and postgraduate curricula. In addition, differences in student and teacher perceptions that could impact curricular integration of VPs were explored. Methods A two-phase descriptive study was performed: 1) evaluation of the VP design process and curricular integration, conducted upon academic medical teachers; 2) evaluation of learning and clinical reasoning experiences with VPs, from the students' perspective. Results The results of this study document high acceptance of VPs by both medical teachers and students (n = 252).VPs seem to fulfill most needs as set by course directors, while they satisfy student needs and create perceptions of improved knowledge and clinical skills reasoning. Conclusions Medical educators have encountered educational challenges upon transforming the curriculum. To develop VPs, academic institutions have to pay equal attention to the needs of potential adopters and VP authors. Strategic development and use of VPs may motivate more widespread integration of VPs and lead to a high quality medical education system."
Extended cardiopulmonary resuscitation: from high fidelity simulation scenario to the first clinical applications in Poznan out-of-hospital cardiac arrest program,PERFUSION-UK,"Background: The outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients are poor. In some OHCA cases, the reason is potentially reversible cardiac or aortic disease. It was suggested previously that high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) followed by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support may improve the grave prognosis of OHCA. However, extended CPR (ECPR) with ECMO application is an extremely invasive and cutting-edge procedure. The purpose of this article is to describe how high-fidelity medical simulation as a safe tool enabled implementation of the complex, multi-stage ECPR procedure. Method: A high fidelity simulation of OHCA in street conditions was prepared and carried out as part of a ECPR procedure implemented in an in-hospital area. The simulation tested communication and collaboration of several medical teams from the pre-hospital to in-hospital phases along with optimal use of equipment in management of a sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) patient. Results: The critical and weak points of an earlier created scenario were collected into a simulation scenario checklist of ECPR algorithm architecture. A few days later, two ECPR procedures followed by cardiologic interventions for OHCA patients (one pulmonary artery embolectomy for acute pulmonary thrombosis and one percutaneous coronary artery angioplasty with drug eluting stent implantation for acute occlusion of the left anterior descending artery), were performed for the first time in Poland. The protocol was activated five times in the first 2 months of the POHCA Program. Conclusion: High fidelity medical simulation in real-life conditions was confirmed to be a safe, useful tool to test and then implement the novel and complex medical procedures. It enabled to find, analyze and solve the weakest points of the earlier developed theoretical protocol and eventually succeed in clinical application of complete ECPR procedure."
Using Simulation and Case Studies Combined to Improve Student Knowledge: A Retrospective Study,NURSING EDUCATION PERSPECTIVES,"AIM The aim of the study was to examine effects of high-fidelity simulation and computerized case studies in an advanced medical-surgical course. BACKGROUND The challenges of coordinating clinical education and desire to utilize innovative methods of teaching were the impetus for course design. METHOD A retrospective review compared HESITM specialty exam scores for groups of the newer and former course design. In the newly configured course, students alternated weekly between simulation and computer-assisted case studies and traditional clinical experiences. RESULTS Quantitative methods were utilized to analyze data; HESI specialty exam scores were determined to be statistically significantly higher for the groups of the newer design model. CONCLUSION Incorporating case studies and high-fidelity simulation on a biweekly basis may be the reason for improved performance."
Computerized tomographic simulation compared with clinical mark-up in palliative radiotherapy: A prospective study,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS,"Purpose: To evaluate the impact of computed tomographic (CT) planning in comparison to clinical mark-up (CM) for palliative radiation of chest wall metastases. Methods and Materials: In patients treated with CM for chest wall bone metastases (without conventional simulation/fluoroscopy), two consecutive planning CT scans were acquired with and without an external marker to delineate the CM treatment field. The two sets of scans were fused for evaluation of clinical tumor volume (CTV) coverage by the CM technique. Under-coverage was defined as the proportion of CTV not covered by the CM 80% isodose. Results: Twenty-one treatments (ribs 17, sternum 2, and scapula 2) formed the basis of our study. Due to technical reasons, comparable data between CM and CT plans were available for 19 treatments only. CM resulted in a mean CTV under-coverage of 36%. Eleven sites (58%) had an under-coverage of > 20%. Mean volume of normal tissues receiving >= 80% of the dose was 5.4% in CM and 9.3% in CT plans (p = 0.017). Based on dose-volume histogram comparisons, CT planning resulted in a change of treatment technique from direct apposition to a tangential pair in 7 of 19 cases. Conclusions: CT planning demonstrated a 36% under-coverage of CTV with CM of ribs and chest wall metastases. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc."
Participation of medical students in patient care: How do patients perceive it?,JOURNAL OF FAMILY MEDICINE AND PRIMARY CARE,"Introduction: Clinical teaching helps students develop clinical reasoning, decision-making, professionalism, empathy, and patient management. These benefits can only be obtained if patients show reasonable acceptance towards medical students. The aim of this study was to assess patients' perceptions regarding their level of acceptance towards students' participation in their healthcare. Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at King Fahd University hospital between December 2018 and March 2019. The data were collected via face-to-face interviews with patients from four clinical departments using a self-administered questionnaire. A total of 196 patients were approached for an interview, of whom 187 agreed to participate (a response rate of 95.4%). Results: Overall, patients showed a positive attitude towards students' participation in their care. The acceptance rate was higher in cases where there was minimal or no student-patient physical contact, such as reading patient's medical records (88.8%) and attending outpatient clinics (83.3%). On the other hand, the refusal rate increased dramatically (from 11% to 43.3%) when permission was sought from patients to perform diagnostic procedures. In a comparison of specialties, the highest refusal rate was observed in the obstetrics/gynecology department, whereas the lowest refusal rate was observed in the pediatrics department. Conclusions: Patients seeking healthcare services in a tertiary care teaching hospital have an overall positive attitude towards the involvement of undergraduate students in their medical care. The higher refusal rate with regard to students performing a physical examination and diagnostic procedures is alarming and demands alternative clinical teaching solutions, such as simulation-based training."
Interactive Algorithms for Teaching and Learning Acute Medicine in the Network of Medical Faculties MEFANET,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,"Background: Medical Faculties Network (MEFANET) has established itself as the authority for setting standards for medical educators in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, 2 independent countries with similar languages that once comprised a federation and that still retain the same curricular structure for medical education. One of the basic goals of the network is to advance medical teaching and learning with the use of modern information and communication technologies. Objective: We present the education portal AKUTNE.CZ as an important part of the MEFANET's content. Our focus is primarily on simulation-based tools for teaching and learning acute medicine issues. Methods: Three fundamental elements of the MEFANET e-publishing system are described: (1) medical disciplines linker, (2) authentication/authorization framework, and (3) multidimensional quality assessment. A new set of tools for technology-enhanced learning have been introduced recently: Sandbox (works in progress), WikiLectures (collaborative content authoring), Moodle-MEFANET (central learning management system), and Serious Games (virtual casuistics and interactive algorithms). The latest development in MEFANET is designed for indexing metadata about simulation-based learning objects, also known as electronic virtual patients or virtual clinical cases. The simulations assume the form of interactive algorithms for teaching and learning acute medicine. An anonymous questionnaire of 10 items was used to explore students' attitudes and interests in using the interactive algorithms as part of their medical or health care studies. Data collection was conducted over 10 days in February 2013. Results: In total, 25 interactive algorithms in the Czech and English languages have been developed and published on the AKUTNE.CZ education portal to allow the users to test and improve their knowledge and skills in the field of acute medicine. In the feedback survey, 62 participants completed the online questionnaire (13.5%) from the total 460 addressed. Positive attitudes toward the interactive algorithms outnumbered negative trends. Conclusions: The peer-reviewed algorithms were used for conducting problem-based learning sessions in general medicine (first aid, anesthesiology and pain management, emergency medicine) and in nursing (emergency medicine for midwives, obstetric analgesia, and anesthesia for midwifes). The feedback from the survey suggests that the students found the interactive algorithms as effective learning tools, facilitating enhanced knowledge in the field of acute medicine. The interactive algorithms, as a software platform, are open to academic use worldwide. The existing algorithms, in the form of simulation-based learning objects, can be incorporated into any educational website (subject to the approval of the authors)."
"Success, failure and emotions: examining the relationship between performance feedback and emotions in diagnostic reasoning",ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,"Students experience a variety of emotions following achievement outcomes which stand to influence how they learn and perform in academic settings. However, little is known about the link between student outcome emotions and dimensions of performance feedback in computer-based learning environments (CBLEs). Understanding the dynamics of this relationship is particularly important for high-stakes, competency-based domains such as medical education. In this study, we examined the relationship between medical students' (N = 30) outcome emotion profiles and their performance on a diagnostic reasoning task in the CBLE, BioWorld. We found that participants could be organized into distinct emotion groups using k-means cluster analyses based on their self-reported outcome emotion profiles: an expected positive emotion cluster and negative emotion cluster and an unexpected low intensity emotion cluster. A clear relationship was found between emotion clusters and diagnostic performance such that participants classified to the positive emotion cluster had the highest performance; those classified to the negative emotion cluster had the lowest performance; and those classified to the low intensity emotion cluster had performance outcomes that fell between the other two. Our discussion focuses on the theoretical implications of emotion classification and design recommendations for learning environments and emotional interventions in computer-based contexts."
Cognitive neuroscience of human counterfactual reasoning,FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE,"Counterfactual reasoning is a hallmark of human thought, enabling the capacity to shift from perceiving the immediate environment to an alternative, imagined perspective. Mental representations of counterfactual possibilities (e.g., imagined past events or future outcomes not yet at hand) provide the basis for learning from past experience, enable planning and prediction, support creativity and insight, and give rise to emotions and social attributions (e.g., regret and blame). Yet remarkably little is known about the psychological and neural foundations of counterfactual reasoning. In this review, we survey recent findings from psychology and neuroscience indicating that counterfactual thought depends on an integrative network of systems for affective processing, mental simulation, and cognitive control. We review evidence to elucidate how these mechanisms are systematically altered through psychiatric illness and neurological disease. We propose that counterfactual thinking depends on the coordination of multiple information processing systems that together enable adaptive behavior and goal directed decision making and make recommendations for the study of counterfactual inference in health, aging, and disease."
"Clinical reasoning in nursing, a think-aloud study using virtual patients - A base for an innovative assessment",NURSE EDUCATION TODAY,"In health-care education, it is important to assess the competencies that are essential for the professional role. To develop clinical reasoning skills is crucial for nursing practice and therefore an important learning outcome in nursing education programmes. Virtual patients (VPs) are interactive computer simulations of real-life clinical scenarios and have been suggested for use not only for learning, but also for assessment of clinical reasoning. The aim of this study was to investigate how experienced paediatric nurses reason regarding complex VP cases and how they make clinical decisions. The study was also aimed to give information about possible issues that should be assessed in clinical reasoning exams for post-graduate students in diploma specialist paediatric nursing education. The information from this study is believed to be of high value when developing scoring and grading models for a VP-based examination for the specialist diploma in paediatric nursing education. Using the think-aloud method, data were collected from 30 RNs working in Swedish paediatric departments, and child or school health-care centres. Content analysis was used to analyse the data. The results indicate that experienced nurses try to consolidate their hypotheses by seeing a pattern and judging the value of signs, symptoms, physical examinations, laboratory tests and radiology. They show high specific competence but earlier experience of similar cases was also of importance for the decision making. The nurses thought it was an innovative assessment focusing on clinical reasoning and clinical decision making. They thought it was an enjoyable way to be assessed and that all three main issues could be assessed using VPs. In conclusion, VPs seem to be a possible model for assessing the clinical reasoning process and clinical decision making, but how to score and grade such exams needs further research.

Progress in Knee Arthroscopy Skills of Residents and Medical Students: A Prospective Assessment of Simulator Exercises and Analysis of Learning Curves,JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION,"OBJECTIVE: Knee arthroscopies are very common orthopedic procedures. For a number of reasons, including increased public awareness for medical errors, patient safety, strict regulations governing duty-hours for residents, surgeons' liability, and an increasing emphasis on the efficient use of operating room time, interest in simulator training is on the rise. It was the purpose of this study to analyze learning curves of medical students and orthopedic resident surgeons using a virtual knee arthroscopy simulator. DESIGN: Learning curves of medical students and orthopedic residents were measured perspective using an arthroscopic training simulator for 2 different exercises. Time, camera and probe movement as well as camera and probe roughness were the parameters to be compared. Mean and standard deviation of the initial and the final score for the consecutively performed exercises as well as their slope were reported. SETTING: The study was performed at the Medical University of Innsbruck, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. Level of clinical care: institutional. PARTICIPANTS: A Students Group (n = 10) consisting of medical students at the Medical University of Innsbruck with no prior knowledge of arthroscopy but interest in orthopedic surgery was selected. The group was compared to a Residents Group (n = 9) which was comprised of orthopedic resident surgeons who had learned arthroscopy in operation courses. All participants involved in the study did several repetitions of the described exercises. RESULTS: Both groups improved their skills after several repetitions. Residents were on average faster, moved the camera less, and touched the cortical tissue less than the students. For certain parameters students showed a steeper improvement curve than did residents, because the students started from a different experience level. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our results demonstrate the usefulness of virtual knee arthroscopy simulators as an important tool for improving surgical and arthroscopic skills in orthopedic resident surgeons, and medical students.

The Effects of Simulation on Nursing Students' Critical Thinking Scores: A Quantitative Study,NEWBORN AND INFANT NURSING REVIEWS,"Simulation has become the innovative method of incorporating clinical and theoretical knowledge and experiences for nursing students. It is essential for educators to offer strategies that develop students' critical-thinking abilities. This experiment used the Health Sciences Reasoning Test to determine if critical-thinking scores improved in the associate degree in nursing student after exposure to multiple clinical simulation scenarios (Facione & Facione. Health Sciences Reasoning Test (HSRT): a test for critical thinking skills for health care professionals. Test manual. Millbrae, CA: The California Academic Press LLC; 2006). Participants were 53 students from the medical-surgical course of an associate degree in nursing program of a college of nursing in the Midwest. Control participants received two simulation scenarios, and experimental participants received five scenarios. As predicted, experimental participants showed a greater increase in critical-thinking scores, demonstrating that simulation can enhance the quality of nursing education providing guaranteed clinical experiences that increase critical-thinking skills, as well as providing high-tech training for nursing students. Implications for nursing education and further research are discussed."
Interprofessional collaborative reasoning by residents and nurses in internal medicine: Evidence from a simulation study,MEDICAL TEACHER,"Clinical reasoning has been studied in residents or nurses, using interviews or patient-provider encounters. Despite a growing interest in interprofessional collaboration, the notion of collaborative reasoning has not been well studied in clinical settings. Our study aims at exploring resident-nurse collaborative reasoning in a simulation setting. We enrolled 14 resident-nurse teams from a general internal medicine division in a mixed methods study. Teams each managed one of four acute case scenarios, followed by a stimulated-recall session. A qualitative, inductive analysis of the transcripts identified five dimensions of collaborative reasoning: diagnostic reasoning, patient management, patient monitoring, communication with the patient, and team communication. Three investigators (two senior physicians, one nurse) assessed individual and team performances using a five-point Likert scale, and further extracted elements supporting the collaborative reasoning process. Global assessment of the resident-nurse team was not simply an average of individual performances. Qualitative results underlined the need to improve situational awareness, particularly for task overload. Team communication helped team members stay abreast of each other's thoughts and improve their efficiency. Residents and nurses differed in their reasoning processes, and awareness of this difference may contribute to improving interprofessional collaboration. Understanding collaborative reasoning can provide an additional dimension to interprofessional education."
The use of simulation for emergency medicine resident assessment,ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE,"Simulations are exercises designed to mimic real-life situations in which learners are given the opportunity to reason through a clinical problem and make critical decisions without the potential of harming actual patients. Simulation, using a variety of formats, is useful for assessing the core competencies-particularly patient care (decision making, prioritizing, procedural skills), interpersonal skills (team leadership, communication), and systems-based practice (team structure and utilization, resource use). High-fidelity computerized human simulators are a relatively new tool for use in medical simulation. These realistic mannequins mimic physical findings including respiratory rate, breath sounds, central and peripheral pulses, murmurs, and pupil reactivity. They generate an electrocardiographic (ECG) waveform, cardiac indices, and oxygen saturation that can be viewed on standard cardiac monitoring equipment and can be programmed to respond physiologically to medications and invasive procedures. The use of human simulators to reproduce life-threatening situations will be especially useful in assessing the clinical competence of emergency medicine physicians. Operational definitions of competence and tools with which to evaluate performance must first be developed. Standardization of scenarios and evaluation tools will permit assessment of the reproducibility of scenarios and the reliability and validity of the tools used to measure competence."
The effect of improving task representativeness on capturing nurses' risk assessment judgements: a comparison of written case simulations and physical simulations,BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING,"Background: The validity of studies describing clinicians' judgements based on their responses to paper cases is questionable, because - commonly used - paper case simulations only partly reflect real clinical environments. In this study we test whether paper case simulations evoke similar risk assessment judgements to the more realistic simulated patients used in high fidelity physical simulations. Methods: 97 nurses (34 experienced nurses and 63 student nurses) made dichotomous assessments of risk of acute deterioration on the same 25 simulated scenarios in both paper case and physical simulation settings. Scenarios were generated from real patient cases. Measures of judgement ` ecology' were derived from the same case records. The relationship between nurses' judgements, actual patient outcomes (i.e. ecological criteria), and patient characteristics were described using the methodology of judgement analysis. Logistic regression models were constructed to calculate Lens Model Equation parameters. Parameters were then compared between the modeled paper-case and physical-simulation judgements. Results: Participants had significantly less achievement (ra) judging physical simulations than when judging paper cases. They used less modelable knowledge (G) with physical simulations than with paper cases, while retaining similar cognitive control and consistency on repeated patients. Respiration rate, the most important cue for predicting patient risk in the ecological model, was weighted most heavily by participants. Conclusions: To the extent that accuracy in judgement analysis studies is a function of task representativeness, improving task representativeness via high fidelity physical simulations resulted in lower judgement performance in risk assessments amongst nurses when compared to paper case simulations. Lens Model statistics could prove useful when comparing different options for the design of simulations used in clinical judgement analysis. The approach outlined may be of value to those designing and evaluating clinical simulations as part of education and training strategies aimed at improving clinical judgement and reasoning."
A medical play experience: Preparing undergraduate nursing students for clinical practice,NURSE EDUCATION TODAY,"Background: Undergraduate nursing programs are required to prepare nursing students to care for people across the lifespan, however due to limited paediatric nursing content in undergraduate nursing curricula and limited paediatric clinical placements, nursing graduates may lack competence and experience in caring for children. Objectives: The aim of this study was to enhance undergraduate nursing students? work readiness and confidence to care for children by immersing them in a mock paediatric ward experience where students could practice using medical play to communicate and engage with children. Participants: Participants (n = 22) were undergraduate nursing students recruited across all years from a Bachelor of Nursing program. Design: Participants were involved in a mock paediatric hospital experience providing them the opportunity to engage with children from 2 to 8 years. Methods: A mixed methods approach was used. Participants completed a confidence scale questionnaire pre and post the mock paediatric ward experience and a satisfaction scale post the experience. Inductive thematic analysis was used to analyse qualitative data. Quantitative data was analysed using the Wilcoxon Signed-Ranked Test. Results: Findings indicated a marked improvement in paediatric nursing skills and work readiness among the student nurses post intervention. Participants developed confidence in the use of medical play in the mock paediatric nursing setting. Improvements in paediatric nursing skills in relation to clinical learning, clinical reasoning and clinical confidence were reported. Conclusions: The mock children?s ward provided a real time paediatric experience for undergraduate nursing students to practice using medical play to communicate and engage with children. Nursing students had the opportunity to experience children?s play, practice age related communication and provide explanations to children about hospital related procedures that children may encounter. With the lack of paediatric placements, it is necessary that nursing curricula examine strategies to enhance the learning for undergraduate students about paediatrics."
Taking Simulation to New Heights: Designing a Flight Simulation Center,CLINICAL SIMULATION IN NURSING,"Air medical transport requires that the practitioner develop clinical and diagnostic reasoning abilities and manage the dynamic needs of the patient in unstructured, uncertain, and often unforgiving environments. High-fidelity simulation can be instrumental in training interprofessional flight teams to improve competency through quality and safe patient care during medical transport that may otherwise take years to learn because of the inconsistency in real-life experience. Because of the particularly unfavorable conditions in critical care air transport, a helicopter simulator designed to replicate the phases of flight and train teams in critical care transport scenarios is being developed for the Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing in Cleveland, Ohio. The goal is to provide quality nursing and medical instruction in a simulated flight center while also presenting relevant clinical experiences for biomedical engineering students. These simulation experiences will prepare interdisciplinary teams of students for collaborative practice, research, and leadership."
A Rubric to Assess Students' Clinical Reasoning When Encountering Virtual Patients,JOURNAL OF NURSING EDUCATION,"Background: Training with virtual patients has been proposed as a suitable learning activity to improve clinical reasoning skills for nursing students. However, published instruments with the capacity to assess students' reasoning process in the encounter with virtual patients are lacking. Method: Deductive and abductive analyses were used to adapt the Lasater Clinical Judgment Rubric (LCJR) to assess nursing students' clinical reasoning skills in the encounter with virtual patients. The new rubric's ability to capture nursing students' clinical reasoning processes was tested using deductive analysis and statistical analysis. Results: A grading rubric for virtual patients, the vpLCJR, was developed. Cronbach's alpha showed .892, indicating good internal consistency. Conclusion: The rubric vpLCJR, which deconstructs aspects of clinical reasoning for both students and faculty members, can be used to clarify expectations, assess students' clinical reasoning process, and provide feedback for learning when nursing students encounter virtual patients."
Nurses' reasoning process during care planning taking pressure ulcer prevention as an example. A think-aloud study,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES,"Background: Nurses' clinical reasoning is of great importance for the delivery of safe and efficient care. Pressure ulcer prevention allows a variety of aspects within nursing to be viewed. Objective: The aim of this study was to describe both the process and the content of nurses' reasoning during care planning at different nursing homes, using pressure ulcer prevention as an example. Design: A qualitative research design was chosen. Settings: Seven different nursing homes within one community were included. Participants: Eleven registered nurses were interviewed. Method: The methods used were think-aloud technique, protocol analysis and qualitative content analysis. Client simulation illustrating transition was used. The case used for care planning was in three parts covering the transition from hospital until 3 weeks in the nursing home. Result: Most nurses in this study conducted direct and indirect reasoning in a wide range of areas in connection with pressure ulcer prevention. The reasoning focused different parts of the nursing process depending on part of the case. Complex assertations as well as strategies aiming to reduce cognitive strain were rare. Nurses involved in direct nursing care held a broader reasoning than consultant nurses. Both explanations and actions based on older ideas and traditions occurred. Conclusions: Reasoning concerning pressure ulcer prevention while care planning was dominated by routine thinking. Knowing the person over a period of time made a more complex reasoning possible. The nurses' experience, knowledge together with how close to the elderly the nurses work seem to be important factors that affect the content of reasoning. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Education in neonatology by simulation: between reality and declaration of intent,JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL & NEONATAL MEDICINE,"An unexpected event is not rare in Neonatology and can be dramatic: the operators must act with the right skills and abilities in the shortest time. Often it is a team effort and each member must be trained adequately. According to the Swiss cheese model by J. Reason, an accident is never the consequence of a single error, but the very final result of a chain of misunderstandings, irregularities or negligence (cheese holes): several holes allow the final medical error. Therefore, we should avoid those holes in our work. The clinical risk is always around the corner. The legal issues are becoming more and more relevant and lead to a defensive medicine, which is definitely not the best practice. For this reason, raising the safety standards is mandatory. With this purpose, after a decade of experience in traditional training courses, we started testing a new strategy of continuous education in Neonatology by means of high-fidelity simulation. Since 2008, we have arranged and managed a Center for Neonatal Simulation and Advanced Training in the Neonatology Unit of the University Hospital of Pisa. We have already delivered courses to pediatricians, neonatologists, anesthesiologists, gynecologists, emergency doctors, midwives and nurses, using an advanced Laerdal SimNewB simulator to teach diagnostic and therapeutic skills or communication strategies. The model has been proposed to the Italian Society of Neonatology and it has been decided to create a Task Force to discuss our model and encourage to use it in other Italian areas."
Nursing undergraduates' perception of preparedness using patient electronic medical records in clinical practice,AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING,"Objective: To investigate third-year undergraduate nursing students perceptions and views on being prepared for using patient electronic medical records (EMR) in clinical placement after using only paper-based documentation during their education program; and their opinion on the introduction of EMR in the university simulated learning environments to be work ready. Background: Contemporaneous clinical practice in many countries now requires nurses to competently use patient EMR including electronic observation and medication charts. However, Australia has been slow in introducing this learning into undergraduate nursing programs. For this reason, there is a knowledge gap examining nursing students' viewpoints on learning EMR in their undergraduate program in preparation for the clinical environment and future registered nurses in Australia. Methods: All third-year students enrolled in the undergraduate nursing program at one regional metropolitan university in New South Wales (including three campuses) were invited to complete an electronic questionnaire. This survey included questions on the students' perceptions on their confidence and preparedness using EMR in clinical practice based on their current paper-based learning in the university simulation laboratories; and their opinions on the benefits of integrating EMR learning into the undergraduate nursing curriculum. Results: Seventy third-year nursing students completed the questionnaire, a response rate of 13.2%. Most respondents (71.1%) did not feel prepared to use EMR in the clinical setting after only learning paper-based documentation and 81.7% did not feel confident accessing patients EMR the first time. Nearly all students (98.5%) believed they would be more confident using EMR initially in their clinical placements if there had been opportunity to practice using EMR in the university simulation laboratories. There was a significant difference with female participants perceived improved confidence accessing patients EMR, if EMR was integrated into the university simulated laboratories compared to the male participants (p=0.007). Conclusion: In this study, third year nursing students believed that learning to use an EMR program in the university simulated environment will increase their confidence and preparedness when on clinical placement and be work ready as registered nurses. Implications for research, policy and practice: This study showcases the importance of preparing nursing students for entering the workforce as confident and competent new graduate registered nurses and integrating health informatics and digital health technologies universities in undergraduate nursing programs in Australia. Future studies on Australian student's experience with the introduction of an academic EMR program is recommended. What is already known about the topic? center dot Using patient electronic medical records (EMR) is included in the nurse's scope of practice in healthcare services worldwide. This scope of practice requires that nursing students learn the skills to use EMR in a safe environment. What this paper adds: center dot Third year nursing students are not being prepared to use EMR in the clinical setting based on paper-based learning center dot Majority of students identified the need to learn to use EMR in university simulation labs prior to clinical placement center dot Effective integration of EMR into nursing undergraduate curriculum in Australia is essential"
Using live tissue laboratories to promote clinical reasoning in doctor of physical therapy students,ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION,"Moore WA, Noonan AC. Using live tissue laboratories to promote clinical reasoning in doctor of physical therapy students. Adv Physiol Educ 34: 54-58, 2010; doi: 10.1152/advan.00059.2009.-Recently, the use of animal laboratories has decreased in medical and basic science programs due to lack of trained faculty members, student concerns about animal welfare, and the increased availability of inexpensive alternatives such as computer simulations and videos. Animal laboratories, however, have several advantages over alternative forms of instruction, including an increased sense of learner responsibility, long-term psychomotor competency, and improved ability to examine functional relationships. While the use of animal laboratories has been studied in medical programs, it has not been examined in physical therapy or other allied health programs. The purposes of this study were to examine the attitudes of student physical therapists toward clinically relevant animal laboratories and to determine if student physical therapists felt that the laboratory modules prepared them for future course work and clinical internships. Written surveys completed by the study participants indicated that most students enjoyed the labs and believed that they helped prepare them for course examinations. Additionally, the majority of students believed that the laboratory modules helped them prepare for future course work and clinical internships."
Clinical Reasoning Assessment Methods: A Scoping Review and Practical Guidance,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,"Purpose An evidence-based approach to assessment is critical for ensuring the development of clinical reasoning (CR) competence. The wide array of CR assessment methods creates challenges for selecting assessments fit for the purpose; thus, a synthesis of the current evidence is needed to guide practice. A scoping review was performed to explore the existing menu of CR assessments. Method Multiple databases were searched from their inception to 2016 following PRISMA guidelines. Articles of all study design types were included if they studied a CR assessment method. The articles were sorted by assessment methods and reviewed by pairs of authors. Extracted data were used to construct descriptive appendixes, summarizing each method, including common stimuli, response formats, scoring, typical uses, validity considerations, feasibility issues, advantages, and disadvantages. Results A total of 377 articles were included in the final synthesis. The articles broadly fell into three categories: non-workplace-based assessments(e.g., multiplechoice questions, extended matching questions, key feature examinations, script concordance tests); assessments in simulated clinical environments (objective structured clinical examinations and technology-enhanced simulation); and workplace-based assessments (e.g., direct observations, global assessments, oral case presentations, written notes). Validity considerations, feasibility issues, advantages, and disadvantages differed by method. Conclusions There are numerous assessment methods that align with different components of the complex construct of CR. Ensuring competency requires the development of programs of assessment that address all components of CR. Such programs are ideally constructed of complementary assessment methods to account for each method's validity and feasibility issues, advantages, and disadvantages."
Assessing Clinical Competency: Reports from Discussion Groups,JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EDUCATION,"This report describes proposed new models for assessment of eight of the nine clinical competencies the American Veterinary Medical Association Council on Education requires for accreditation. The models were developed by discussion groups at the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges' Clinical Competency Symposium. Clinical competencies and proposed models (in parentheses) are described. Competency 1: comprehensive patient diagnosis (neurologic examination on a dog, clinical reasoning skills); Competency 2: comprehensive treatment planning (concept mapping, computerized case studies); Competency 3: anesthesia, pain management (student portfolio); Competency 4: surgery skills (objective structured clinical examination, cased-based examination, super dog model); Competency 5: medicine skills (clinical reasoning and case management, skills checklist); Competency 6: emergency and intensive care case management (computerized case study or scenario); Competency 7: health promotion, disease prevention/biosecurity (360 degrees evaluation, case-based computer simulation); Competency 8: client communications and ethical conduct (Web-based evaluation forms, client survey, communicating with stakeholders, telephone conversation, written scenario-based cases). The report also describes faculty recognition for participating in clinical competency assessments."
Development and validation of Dutch version of Lasater Clinical Judgment Rubric in hospital practice: An instrument design study,NURSE EDUCATION TODAY,"Background: Clinical reasoning in patient care is a skill that cannot be observed directly. So far, no reliable, valid instrument exists for the assessment of nursing students' clinical reasoning skills in hospital practice. Lasater's clinical judgment rubric (LCJR), based on Tanner's model Thinking like a nurse has been tested, mainly in academic simulation settings. Objectives: The aim is to develop a Dutch version of the LCJR (D-LCJR) and to test its psychometric properties when used in a hospital traineeship context. Design: A mixed-model approach was used to develop and to validate the instrument. Setting: Ten dedicated educational units in a university hospital. Participants: A well-mixed group of 52 nursing students, nurse coaches and nurse educators. Methods: A Delphi panel developed the D-LCJR. Students' clinical reasoning skills were assessed live by nurse coaches, nurse educators and students who rated themselves. The psychometric properties tested during the assessment process are reliability, reproducibility, content validity and construct validity by testing two hypothesis: 1) a positive correlation between assessed and self-reported sum scores (convergent validity) and 2) a linear relation between experience and sum score (clinical validity). Results: The obtained D-LCJR was found to be internally consistent, Cronbach's alpha 0.93. The rubric is also reproducible with intraclass correlations between 0.69 and 0.78. Experts judged it to be content valid. The two hypothesis were both tested significant, supporting evidence for construct validity. Conclusion: The translated and modified LCJR, is a promising tool for the evaluation of nursing students' development in clinical reasoning in hospital traineeships, by students, nurse coaches and nurse educators. More evidence on construct validity is necessary, in particular for students at the end of their hospital traineeship. Based on our research, the D-LCJR applied in hospital traineeships is a usable and reliable tool."
Preparing Physiotherapy Students for Clinical Placement: Student Perceptions of Low-Cost Peer Simulation. A Mixed-Methods Study,SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE-JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE,"Introduction Simulation is increasingly used in health care education, yet the organizational and financial costs can be prohibitive. This study aimed to investigate whether peer simulation is perceived by third-year undergraduate physiotherapy students as valuable for clinical placement preparation. Methods Third-year undergraduate physiotherapy students participated in a 9-week peer simulation program, using each other as patients, and were invited to complete two surveys evaluating perceptions of the program. The program consisted of weekly patient interactions during which students were required to assess and treat a patient under strict simulation guidelines and in accordance with stated learning objectives. Items rated included self-perceived skills, confidence, time management, and clinical placement readiness and included collection of qualitative responses. Surveys were released at commencement and completion of the simulation program. Results Of 79 third-year students, 63% completed survey 1 and 66% completed survey 2. Students had high expectations of the program and these were consistently met. Peer simulation rated highly for all items, including identifying knowledge and skill deficits, and improving confidence, clinical reasoning, time management, and communication. Simulation was considered safe, supportive, engaging, and valuable for clinical placement preparation. Students identified some lack of authenticity when working with peers. Conclusions Peer simulation was perceived by students as valuable in preparing them for clinical placement, despite a perceived lack of realism. These findings support the use of peer simulation as an alternative to the use of more formalized standardized patients in an undergraduate physiotherapy program. Further investigation is required to establish a detailed cost analysis of the program and to determine the amount of realism required to optimize the benefits of this promising educational strategy."
Nursing and paramedicine student and academic perceptions of the two phase debrief model: A thematic analysis,NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE,"Simulation debriefing standards and models recommend simulation facilitators spend time debriefing learner feelings and clinical reasoning following the simulation scenario. Many debriefing models are available, more so in nursing than in paramedicine, however few models combine specific frameworks to debrief learner feelings and unpack cognitive decisions. The Two Phase Debrief model was designed to support debriefers to spend equal amounts of time debriefing learner felt reactions and clinical decision making, guided by specific tools and skills for each phase. Australian nursing and paramedicine students (n = 19) and academics (n = 9) evaluated the Two Phase Debrief model using a qualitative descriptive design. Analysis of focus group data revealed three themes: Valuing time for debrief, Valuing skills for debrief and Valuing emotions. Across the two disciplines, academics agreed learners would benefit from debriefing using Two Phase Debrief model but considered time a barrier. Nursing and paramedicine students felt the equal time spent exploring emotions and clinical reasoning contributed to a positive learning experience and that expert debriefers may not need disciplinary specific content knowledge. These and other findings discussed indicate there is more work needed to understand the appetite for and required skills of expert cross disciplinary simulation debriefing teams."
The Impact of Critical Thinking on Clinical Judgment During Simulation With Senior Nursing Students,NURSING EDUCATION PERSPECTIVES,"AIM The study examined the impact of critical thinking (CT) on clinical judgment (CJ) during a pediatric Objective Structured Clinical Evaluation (OSCE) with 160 pre-licensure nursing students. BACKGROUND Educators are called to transform teaching strategies to develop CJ but confusion exists over definitions. METHOD A descriptive correlational design was used to examine demographics and Tower of Hanoi (TOH) and Health Science Reasoning Test (HSRT) scores. CJ was measured by scores on the Lasater Clinical Judgment Rubric (LCJR) from videotaped OSCEs. RESULTS Participants were: 86 percent female, 42 percent Caucasian, median 23 years, with 49 percent having health care experience. Students averaged seven moves over minimum on the TOH. Average scores were: HSRT 25/38 and LCJR 31/44. Statistically significant predictors of CJ were gender, ethnicity, HSRT deduction, and analysis; 11 CT variables accounted for 17 percent of LCJR scores. CONCLUSION Educators need to utilize/develop innovative teaching strategies addressing CJ predictors."
Ten tips for organising a Bleep Roulette for final year medical students and new foundation trainees,POSTGRADUATE MEDICAL JOURNAL,"The initial period adjusting to the roles and responsibilities of a new foundation doctor can be a challenging and anxious time for graduating medical students and new trainees. Over recent years, many educational initiatives such as shadowing placements, assistantships and compulsory induction programmes have been implemented to improve medical student preparedness for clinical practice. Despite this, many graduates still report a lack of confidence and preparedness when starting their clinical placements, specifically within the context of on-call shifts. Bleep Roulette simulation sessions are progressively being used to further bridge the gap from student to trainee and ensure trainees develop prioritisation, organisational and clinical reasoning skills, improving trainee efficiency during an on-call shift. In this article, we provide 10 tips for medical educators, detailing how to design an efficacious Bleep Roulette session for final year medical students and new foundation trainees."
Development and evaluation of a high-fidelity lactation simulation model for health professional breastfeeding education,INTERNATIONAL BREASTFEEDING JOURNAL,"Background A key reason for premature cessation of breastfeeding is inadequate support from healthcare providers. Most physicians and nurses do not feel confident in their ability to support families with breastfeeding initiation or maintenance. Increasing health professional confidence in clinical lactation skills is key to improving maternal and child health outcomes. High-fidelity (realistic) simulators encourage learner engagement, resulting in increased clinical skills competency, confidence, and transfer to patient care. Lactation educators teach with low-fidelity cloth and single breast models. There are no high-fidelity breast simulators for health professional education in clinical lactation. Development and evaluation of a high-fidelity lactation simulation model In this commentary we describe the development of a high-fidelity Lactation Simulation Model (LSM) and how physician residents, nurse-midwifery students, and clinical lactation experts provided feedback on LSM prototypes. Limitations The user-testing described in this commentary does not represent comprehensive validation of the LSM due to small sample sizes and the significant conflict of interest. Conclusion For breastfeeding rates to improve, mothers need support from their nurses, midwives, pediatricians, obstetricians and gynecologists, and all healthcare staff who interact with pregnant and lactating women. Clinical education with high-fidelity breastfeeding simulators could be the ideal learning modality for trainees and hospital staff to build confidence in clinical lactation skills. The ability of a high-fidelity breastfeeding simulator to increase a learner's lactation knowledge and psychomotor skills acquisition, retention, and transfer to patient care still needs to be tested."
A Natural Language Processing-Based Virtual Patient Simulator and Intelligent Tutoring System for the Clinical Diagnostic Process: Simulator Development and Case Study,JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS,"Background: Shortage of human resources, increasing educational costs, and the need to keep social distances in response to the COVID-19 worldwide outbreak have prompted the necessity of clinical training methods designed for distance learning. Virtual patient simulators (VPSs) may partially meet these needs. Natural language processing (NLP) and intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) may further enhance the educational impact of these simulators. Objective: The goal of this study was to develop a VPS for clinical diagnostic reasoning that integrates interaction in natural language and an ITS. We also aimed to provide preliminary results of a short-term learning test administered on undergraduate students after use of the simulator. Methods: We trained a Siamese long short-term memory network for anamnesis and NLP algorithms combined with Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) ontology for diagnostic hypothesis generation. The ITS was structured on the concepts of knowledge, assessment, and learner models. To assess short-term learning changes, 15 undergraduate medical students underwent two identical tests, composed of multiple-choice questions, before and after performing a simulation by the virtual simulator. The test was made up of 22 questions; 11 of these were core questions that were specifically designed to evaluate clinical knowledge related to the simulated case. Results: We developed a VPS called Hepius that allows students to gather clinical information from the patient's medical history, physical exam, and investigations and allows them to formulate a differential diagnosis by using natural language. Hepius is also an ITS that provides real-time step-by-step feedback to the student and suggests specific topics the student has to review to fill in potential knowledge gaps. Results from the short-term learning test showed an increase in both mean test score (P<.001) and mean score for core questions (P<.001) when comparing presimulation and postsimulation performance. Conclusions: By combining ITS and NLP technologies, Hepius may provide medical undergraduate students with a learning tool for training them in diagnostic reasoning. This may be particularly useful in a setting where students have restricted access to clinical wards, as is happening during the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries worldwide."
Continuing medical education and the anesthesiologist,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ANESTHESIA,"There are a large variety of scheduled activities and courses available to meet the continuing medical education (CME) needs of anesthesiologists. The presentation of CME material varies in format and delivary style. The reasons for attending CME activities include continuing medical education (CME), needs of anesthesiologists. The presentation of CME material varies in format and delivery style. The reasons for attending CME activities include licensure requirements, participation in state and national societies, keeping current with technology, review of old subject material, participation as a lecturer, and other personal reasons. Finding occurs via personal funds, employer support, commercial support, or by research grants. External bodies, such as the American Council of Continuing Medical Education and the American Medical Association, have imposed guidelines in these areas. Methods to evaluate CME activities include retrospective needs assesment, focus groups and complex systems such as the CRISIS criteria. Self-directed CME can be evaluated by data collection that identifies how quickly information is recieved and by the effect of this data on measureable outcome. In the future, CME will increasingly utilize simulators and multimedia computers. Multimedia can bring CME to the physician as opposed to the physsician traveling to a CME site. Virtual reality and artificial intelligence are on the horizon and mayinterface well with the field of anesthesiology due to the technical nature of the discipline and the increasing use of the computer and electronic data collection already occuring in Clinical practice (C) 1991 by Elsevier Science Inc."

"The Causes of Errors in Clinical Reasoning: Cognitive Biases, Knowledge Deficits, and Dual Process Thinking",ACADEMIC MEDICINE,"Contemporary theories of clinical reasoning espouse a dual processing model, which consists of a rapid, intuitive component (Type 1) and a slower, logical and analytical component (Type 2). Although the general consensus is that this dual processing model is a valid representation of clinical reasoning, the causes of diagnostic errors remain unclear. Cognitive theories about human memory propose that such errors may arise from both Type 1 and Type 2 reasoning. Errors in Type 1 reasoning may be a consequence of the associative nature of memory, which can lead to cognitive biases. However, the literature indicates that, with increasing expertise (and knowledge), the likelihood of errors decreases. Errors in Type 2 reasoning may result from the limited capacity of working memory, which constrains computational processes. In this article, the authors review the medical literature to answer two substantial questions that arise from this work: (1) To what extent do diagnostic errors originate in Type 1 (intuitive) processes versus in Type 2 (analytical) processes? (2) To what extent are errors a consequence of cognitive biases versus a consequence of knowledge deficits? The literature suggests that both Type 1 and Type 2 processes contribute to errors. Although it is possible to experimentally induce cognitive biases, particularly availability bias, the extent to which these biases actually contribute to diagnostic errors is not well established. Educational strategies directed at the recognition of biases are ineffective in reducing errors; conversely, strategies focused on the reorganization of knowledge to reduce errors have small but consistent benefits."
Mindful medical practice: An innovative core course to prepare medical students for clerkship,PERSPECTIVES ON MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background Medical students show a decline in empathy and ethical reasoning during medical school that is most marked during clerkship. We believe that part of the problem is that students do not have the skills and ways of being and relating necessary to deal effectively with the overwhelming clinical experience of clerkship. Approach At McGill University in Montreal, starting in January 2015, we have taught a course on mindful medical practice that combines a clinical focus on the combination of mindfulness and congruent relating that is aimed at giving students the skills and ways of being to function effectively in clerkship. The course is taught to all medical students in groups of 20, weekly for 7 weeks, in the 6 months immediately prior to clerkship, a time when students are very open to learning the skills they need to take effective care of patients. Evaluation The course has been well accepted by students as evidenced by their engagement, their evaluations, and their comments in the essays that they write at the end of the course. In a follow-up session at the simulation centre one year later students remember clearly and enact what they were taught in the course. Reflection The next steps will be to conduct a formal evaluation of the effect of our teaching that will involve a combination of qualitative methods to clarify the nature of the impact on our students and a quantitative assessment of the difference the course makes to students' experience and performance in clerkship."
Virtual patients reflecting the clinical reality of primary care - a useful tool to improve cultural competence,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background Virtual patients are educational tools that may be described as case-based interactive computer simulations of clinical scenarios. In terms of learning outcomes, improved clinical reasoning skills and knowledge acquisition have been shown. For further exploring the role of virtual patients in medical education, a greater focus on context-specific cases, combined with suitable educational activities, has been suggested. A knowledge gap has been identified in cultural competence in primary care. As primary care physicians are often the main medical providers for patients with refugee backgrounds, they would probably benefit from improved training focusing on how to apply cultural competence in everyday work. Using virtual patient cases, as a complement to clinical training, may be one way forward. The aim of this study was therefore to explore a learner perspective on the educational use of a virtual patient system designed to contribute to training in cultural competence in a primary care context. Methods Three virtual patient cases portraying patients with refugee backgrounds were developed. The cases addressed various issues and symptoms common in primary care consultations, while also incorporating intercultural aspects. The system also provided the informants with individualized feedback. Primary care physicians and medical students were invited to test the cases and participate in an interview about their experience. Data was analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results The analysis generated the theme Virtual patients might help improve cultural competence in physicians and medical students by complementing knowledge gained through the informal curriculum. Informants at different educational levels found it suitable as a tool for introducing the topic and for reflecting on one's own consultations. It could also compensate for the predominant informal manner of learning cultural competence, described by the informants. Conclusions Virtual patients could be useful for gaining cultural competence in a primary care context. Advantages that could benefit learners at both pre- and post-graduate levels are decreased dependence on the informal curriculum and being presented with an illustrative way of how cultural competence may be applied in the consultation."
A Fuzzy-Bayesian Model based on the Superposition of States Applied to the Clinical Reasoning Support,2015 SAI INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS CONFERENCE (INTELLISYS),"This research was motivated by the need of a stochastic approach to inference processes on the complex knowledge that guides the medical decision. From this situation developed a mathematical model to Bayesian inference with inaccurate input variables and states of superposition characteristics. The domain of application and verification of the model is related to support clinical reasoning specialist to diagnose children and adolescents with metabolic risk. Bayesian techniques are used in the support for a diagnostic classification, however it is unprovided to infer about the variable which imprecise factor affects the accuracy of the results. Beyond the complexity that makes this scenario, a formal hybrid scheme that gathered Fuzzy Sets and Bayesian Techniques has been developed with the purpose of endorsing the specialist clinical reasoning with a casual and inaccuracy context relations. The model proposes an inference on overlapping states. From actual data records were done simulations applying the model and the results indicated that patients would gradually evolving into a high risk scenario while a Bayesian Expert System classic would be classified in less worrying levels. These results were also verified and confirmed by a team of medical experts consulted during this research. It is expected that the model can be attached to knowledge systems used by medical experts to guide their patients. It is believed to be applicable in other domains whose uncertainty is the biggest problem related to information or knowledge."
How to tell a patient's story? Influence of the case narrative design on the clinical reasoning process in virtul patients,MEDICAL TEACHER,"Background: Virtual patients (VPs) are narrative-based educational activities to train clinical reasoning in a safe environment. Our aim was to explore the influence of the design of the narrative and level of difficulty on the clinical reasoning process, diagnostic accuracy and time-on-task. Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, we analyzed the clinical reasoning process of 46 medical students with six VPs in three different variations: (1) patients showing a friendly behavior, (2) patients showing a disruptive behavior and (3) a version without a patient story. Results: For easy VPs, we did not see a significant difference in diagnostic accuracy. For difficult VPs, the diagnostic accuracy was significantly higher for participants who worked on the friendly VPs compared to the other two groups. Independent from VP difficulty, participants identified significantly more problems and tests for disruptive than for friendly VPs; time on task was comparable for these two groups. The extrinsic motivation of participants working on the VPs without a patient story was significantly lower than for the students working on the friendly VPs. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the measured VP difficulty has a higher influence on the clinical reasoning process and diagnostic accuracy than the variations in the narratives."
Executing medical guidelines on the web: Towards next generation healthcare,KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS,"There is still a lack of full integration between current Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and medical guidelines that encapsulate evidence-based medicine. Thus, general practitioners (GPs) and specialised physicians still have to read document-based medical guidelines and decide among various options for managing common non-life-threatening conditions where the selection of the most appropriate therapeutic option for each individual patient can be a difficult task. This paper presents a simulation framework and computational test-bed. called V.A.F. Framework, for supporting simulations of clinical situations that boosted the integration between Health Level Seven (HL7) and Semantic Web technologies (OWL. SWRL, and OWL-S) to achieve content layer interoperability, between online clinical cases and medical guidelines, and therefore, it proves that higher integration between EHRs and evidence-based medicine can be accomplished which could lead to a next generation of healthcare systems that provide more support to physicians and increase patients' safety.

SIMULATION USE IN PARAMEDIC EDUCATION RESEARCH (SUPER): A DESCRIPTIVE STUDY,PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE,"Objectives. The purpose of this research was to characterize the use of simulation in initial paramedic education programs in order assist stakeholders' efforts to target educational initiatives and resources. This group sought to provide a snapshot of what simulation resources programs have or have access to and how they are used; faculty perceptions about simulation; whether program characteristics, resources, or faculty training influence simulation use; and if simulation resources are uniform for patients of all ages. Methods. This was a cross-sectional census survey of paramedic programs that were accredited or had a Letter of Review from the Committee on Accreditation of Educational Programs for the EMS Professions at the time of the study. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square analyses. Results. Of the 638 surveys sent, 389 valid responses (61%) were analyzed. Paramedic programs reported they have or have access to a wide range of simulation resources (task trainers [100%], simple manikins [100%], intermediate manikins [99%], advanced/fully programmable manikins [91%], live simulated patients [83%], computer-based [71%], and virtual reality [19%]); however, they do not consistently use them, particularly advanced (71%), live simulated patients (66%), computer-based (games, scenarios) (31%), and virtual reality (4%). Simulation equipment (of any type) reportedly sits idle and unused in (31%) of programs. Lack of training was cited as the most common reason. Personnel support specific to simulation was available in 44% of programs. Programs reported using simulation to replace skills more frequently than to replace field or clinical hours. Simulation goals included assessment, critical thinking, and problem-solving most frequently, and patient and crew safety least often. Programs using advanced manikins report manufacturers as their primary means of training (87%) and that 19% of faculty had no training specific to those manikins. Many (78%) respondents felt they should use more simulation. Conclusions. Paramedic programs have and have access to diverse simulation resources; however, faculty training and other program resources appear to influence their use."
On the Usage of Health Records for the Teaching of Decision-Making to Students of Medicine,"NEW DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGY ENHANCED LEARNING: CONCEPT, RESEARCH AND BEST PRACTICES","The development of clinical reasoning and decision-making skills in medicine is inextricably linked to experience. Yet students are failing to gain this experience before embarking on their first medical jobs. This is due to several factors, including advances in medical science resulting in patients that are less likely to be hospitalized and more likely to be treated in outpatient departments. This lack of experience within real-world scenarios has resulted in students feeling they are ill prepared for their first medical jobs. One way to counter such a lack of experience is through the use of software simulations such as Virtual Patients. However, simulations are extremely costly to develop, in terms of both financial outlay and the time required to create them. We report here on the development of an iPad-based Virtual Patient simulation system that uses annotated electronic patient data and health records for the creation of cases to enable students to learn critical decision-making skills. By basing these Virtual Patients on abundant patient records, cases can be more quickly and easily created, thus enabling pools of cases to be accumulated-essential for gaining the experience required for the development of sound clinical reasoning skills."
Why teaching empathy is important for the medical degree,REVISTA CLINICA ESPANOLA,"Empathy is a basic skill in the exercise of medicine and increases patient and physician satisfaction and improves clinical results. However, the teaching of empathy is poorly covered in the teaching plans. A number of studies have observed a reduction in empathy during the final training courses. The reasons for this decline include, the students' excessive academic workload, the prioritisation of acquiring medical expertise over humanistic knowledge, the patient load in hospitals and health centres and the physicians' need to distance themselves from their patients. Nevertheless, intervention studies through simulation with standardised patients have shown an increase in empathy in students, which can be evaluated through the Jefferson scales: JSE-S and JSPPPE. The teaching of empathy to medical students is an important commitment in the curricular programs of medical schools.

"Preferred Thinking Style, Symptom Recognition, and Response by Nursing Students During Simulation",WESTERN JOURNAL OF NURSING RESEARCH,"A better understanding of the relationships between symptom recognition, nursing response, and preferred thinking style is needed to improve nursing education practices. Final semester nursing students (N = 29) completed a high fidelity patient simulation (HFPS) scenario; recognized symptoms (i.e., dyspnea) and responses (i.e., apply oxygen) were recorded, and compared with students' preferred thinking style using the Rational-Experiential Inventory-40. Relationships between concepts were explored. Significant relationships were noted between preference for Rational thinking styles and symptom recognition (p < .05). Preferred thinking style was not related to numbers of therapeutic responses. Thirty percent of students delayed application of oxygen until directed to do so by members of the health care team. Students having a stronger preference for rational thinking demonstrate greater accuracy in cue recognition. More nursing research is needed to explore the cognitive processing during simulation ."
Emergency Department Presentation of a Patient with Altered Mental Status: A Simulation Case for Training Residents and Clinical clerks,CUREUS,"Emergency physicians frequently are required to perform timely assessments on patients who are unable to provide a comprehensive history due to an altered level of responsiveness. The etiology of their altered mental status (AMS) causes a diagnostic dilemma due to its wide differential diagnosis. Physicians must use a timely combination of collateral history, physical examination skills, and investigations to diagnose the cause of the patient's AMS, as many of the potential etiologies can be life-threatening if not quickly managed. For this reason, training learners to perform the required actions accurately and effectively proves difficult during real-life emergencies, where an individual's life may be at risk. Simulation-based education (SBE) offers one solution to this challenge. It allows learners to build confidence by dealing with life-threatening conditions in a safe environment and has been shown to be superior to other forms of clinical training. This scenario explores learners' comfort in some less-practiced, but very important, areas of medicine including obtaining consent for treatment from a substitute decision maker (SDM), explaining various goals of care, and eliciting an advanced care directive from the SDM. Learners and physicians in all fields of medicine must be able to confidently discuss these subjects with patients and their families in order to provide individualized and appropriate management. In this simulation, learners will have the opportunity to explore an unusual AMS presentation and develop their clinical and communication skills by working as a team to manage the patient."
Effectiveness of neonatal emergency nursing education through simulation training: Flipped learning based on Tanner's Clinical Judgement Model,NURSING OPEN,"Aim; To examine the effects of neonatal simulation-based practice by applying flipped learning based on Tanner's clinical judgement model to pre-simulation briefing for nursing students. Design: A quasi-experimental non-equivalent control group pre- and postintervention design. Methods: Using Tanner's clinical judgment model, flipped learning was developed and applied to the pre-simulation briefing curriculum prior to the neonatal nursing simulation exercise. Flipped learning was compared with a general pre-simulation briefing with 65 South Korean students. From September 7, 2019, to October 25, 2019. Results: The experimental group's critical thinking, self-confidence and clinical judgement ability increased, but knowledge, satisfaction and anxiety did not differ from that of the control group. Pre-simulation briefing design focuses on improving students' environmental comfort and reducing anxiety rather than developing complex reasoning skills and clinical judgement abilities. Applying flipped learning based on Tanner's clinical judgement model to pre-simulation briefing increased critical thinking, self-confidence and clinical judgement ability."
Simulations in orthopedics and rehabilitation - Part I: Simulators,BIO-ALGORITHMS AND MED-SYSTEMS,"Nowadays, medical simulators and computer simulation programs are used to train various skills required in medicine. The development of medicine, including orthopedics and rehabilitation, has meant that resident physicians, within a much shorter period of time, must acquire the knowledge and skills that their older colleagues gained over years, learning as they operated on patients. For this reason, simulation very often helps the doctor and others engaged in health care train some techniques necessary during the work before they start working in a clinical environment. They have a chance of fine-tuning certain skills under nonclinical environment. On the other hand, simulation techniques are used in medical scientific research to know and explain the different biological processes that can be used for better patient treatment in the future. In this paper (Part I), the authors focused on the presentation of different types of simulators for the following purposes: test (conducted under laboratory conditions), training (incorporated into school, universities syllabus), diagnostic and therapeutic (within the hospital, clinics, private medical practice)."
A Serious Game for Teaching Nursing Students Clinical Reasoning and Decision-Making Skills,NURSING INFORMATICS 2016: EHEALTH FOR ALL: EVERY LEVEL COLLABORATION - FROM PROJECT TO REALIZATION,"The aim of this study was to design and pilot-test a serious game for teaching nursing students clinical reasoning and decision-making skills in caring for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A video-based serious game prototype was developed. A purposeful sample of six participants tested and evaluated the prototype. Usability issues were identified regarding functionality and user-computer interface. However, overall the serious game was perceived to be useful, usable and likable to use."
Psychological characteristics of students in learning clinical interview skills with the use of virtual patient,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,"BackgroundThe goal of this exploratory study is to analyse which psychological characteristics of students are related to the effectiveness of learning clinical interview skills with the use of a virtual patient (VP).MethodsThe sample consisted of 29 final-year clinical psychology students. The authors' VP tool was used for measuring and teaching clinical interview skills: building contact with the patient, gathering important information, and identifying the students' mistakes. Psychological questionnaires were used to measure the students' psychological features: need for cognitive closure, ability to achieve cognitive structure, beliefs in the changeability of human traits, level of hope, intelligence, positive vs negative affect, and academic knowledge.ResultsThe most important aspect of the diagnostician's psychological features which substantially influence effectiveness of learning interview skills is belief in the stability or changeability of human traits and the need to achieve cognitive closure. Participants who have a belief in human changeability are able to perform the task correctly even without training, while those who believe in human stability improve only slightly with training. Students with lower need of cognitive closure successfully learned to build a good relation with the patient.ConclusionsThe study allows a better understanding of the phenomena occurring during the learning of clinical interview skills with the use of a VP."
Misclassification and discordance of measured blood pressure from patient's true blood pressure in current clinical practice: a clinical trial simulation case study,JOURNAL OF PHARMACOKINETICS AND PHARMACODYNAMICS,"Treatment decisions for hypertension using sphygmomanometer based measurements and the current clinical practice paradigm do not account for the timing of blood pressure (BP) measurement. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical implications of discordance between measured and true BP, to quantify BP misclassification rate at a typical clinical visit in current clinical practice, and to propose a BP calibration system to decrease the impact of timing of BP measurement. A clinical trial simulation case study was performed using an in silico Monte Carlo Simulation approach. The time-courses of BPs with and without an antihypertensive treatment effect were simulated from a baseline BP model combined with an antihypertensive PK/PD model. Virtual subject characteristics were sampled from the FDA internal database. The baseline BP model was qualified using observed 24 h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) data from 225 subjects by a visual predictive check as well as a global sensitivity analysis. First of all, our results showed that the measured cuff BP in current typical clinical practice deviated from the true values. (1) Cuff BP deviated from the true values by more than 5 mmHg in 57 % (95 % CI: 54-61 %) of patients and more than 10 mmHg in 26 % (95 % CI: 22-32 %) of patients respectively. (2) These discordances were reduced to 28 % (deviation a parts per thousand yen5 mmHg, 95 % CI: 18-40 %) and 9 % (deviation a parts per thousand yen10 mmHg, 95 % CI: 4-18%) of patients assuming perfect sphygmomanometer measurement and thus represent the contribution of ignoring the daily circadian rhythm of BP. Secondly, our results showed 23-32 % of patients were misclassified to an incorrect BP category for a casual clinical visit based on JNC 7 guideline. In addition, the accuracy of the measured cuff BP varied by time of clinic visit. Specifically, 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM was identified to be the better time frame, while times before 9:00 AM were the worst time frame. Therefore, clinic visit time may need to be adjusted accordingly. Finally, we proposed an easy BP calibration method for clinic use to adjust for time of day differences due to circadian variability in case that the desirable clinic visit time cannot be tailored for practical reasons."
Diagrammatic Reasoning with Interactive P-V Curves,2013 COMPUTING IN CARDIOLOGY CONFERENCE (CINC),"In this paper, we describe a case study that supports pathophysiological reasoning using a combination of diagrammatic and qualitative reasoning. PressureVolume (P-V) representations of the cardiac cycle have been traditionally used to represent clinical situations, from textbooks to research articles. This has led us to develop an interactive version of the P-V curve which supports diagrammatic inference, based on user-driven modification of essential parameters of the P-V curve. Because diagrammatic inference cannot account for temporal adaptation of the cardio-vascular system, we have extended the diagrammatic reasoning system to incorporate qualitative simulation of adaptive mechanisms. We discuss detailed examples of the system in operation, which produces results fully consistent with the medical literature on some typical pathological situations, for a continuous range of user-driven modification of the P-V curve."
Automatic Treatment of Temporal Issues in Clinical Guidelines in the GLARE System,"MEDINFO 2007: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 12TH WORLD CONGRESS ON HEALTH (MEDICAL) INFORMATICS, PTS 1 AND 2: BUILDING SUSTAINABLE HEALTH SYSTEMS","Temporal constraints play a fundamental role in clinical guidelines. For example, temporal indeterminacy, constraints about duration, delays between actions and periodic repetitions of actions are essential in order to cope with clinical therapies. This paper proposes a computer-based approach in order to deal with temporal constraints in clinical guidelines. Specifically, it provides the possibility to represent such constraints and reason with them (i.e., perform inferences in the form of constraint propagation). We first propose a temporal representation formalism and two constraint propagation algorithms operating on it, and then we show how they can be exploited in order to provide clinical guideline systems with different temporal facilities. Our approach offers several advantages: for example, during the guideline acquisition phase, it enables to represent temporal constraints and to check their consistency; during the execution phase, it allows the physician to check the consistency between action execution-times and the constraints in the guidelines, and to provide query-answering and temporal simulation facilities (e.g., when choosing among alternative paths in a guideline)."
Effectiveness of an Educational Intervention With High-Fidelity Clinical Simulation to Improve Attitudes Toward Teamwork Among Health Professionals,JOURNAL OF CONTINUING EDUCATION IN NURSING,"Background: Failures in teamwork are a common reason for adverse medical events. The goals of this study are to evaluate attitudes toward teamwork among an interprofessional group of health professionals and to analyze the effectiveness of an educational intervention with high-fidelity clinical simulation to improve these attitudes. Method: An educational intervention was developed that used a 6-hour session that included three simulated clinical cases. The Attitudes Toward Health Care Teams Scale was used for assessment. Mean difference before and after the intervention was calculated with the Wilcoxon test. Results: Positive attitude toward teamwork after completion of the training activities was measured. The health care professionals who showed the most positive attitude toward teamwork were physicians (93.92, SD = 6.58) and resident physicians (95.01, SD = 6.33). The greatest increase was observed among orderlies (p < .001) and nursing assistants (p < .001). Conclusion: The use of clinical simulation for interprofessional training of health care professionals showed a positive effect on attitudes toward teamwork."
First urology simulation boot camp in the United Kingdom,AFRICAN JOURNAL OF UROLOGY,"Objective: Simulation is now firmly established in modern surgical training and is applicable not only to acquiring surgical skills but also to non-surgical skills and professionalism. A 5-day intensive Urology Simulation Boot Camp was run to teach emergency procedural skills, clinical reasoning, and communication skills using clinical scenario simulations, endoscopic and laparoscopic trainers. This paper reports the educational value of this first urology boot camp. Subjects and methods: Sixteen urology UK trainees completed pre-course questionnaires on their operative experience and confidence level in common urological procedures. The course included seven modules covering basic scrotal procedures, laparoscopic skills, ureteroscopy, transurethral resection of the prostate and bladder tumour, green light laser prostatectomy, familiarisation with common endoscopic equipment, bladder washout to remove clots, bladder botox injection, setting up urodynamics. Emergency urological conditions were managed using scenarios on SimMan (R). The main focus of the course was handson training using animal models, bench-top models and virtual reality simulators. Post-course assessment and feedback on the course structure and utility of knowledge gained together with a global outcome score was collected. Results: Overall all the sections of feedback received score of over 4.5/5, with the hands-on training on simulators getting the best score 4.8/5. When trainees were asked The training has equipped me with enhanced knowledge, understanding and skills, the average score was 4.9/5.0. The vast majority of participants felt they would recommend the boot camp to future junior trainees. Conclusion: This first UK Urology Simulation Boot Camp has demonstrated feasibility and effectiveness in enhancing trainee's experience. Given these positive feedbacks there is a good reason to expect that future courses will improve the overall skills of a new urology trainee. (C) 2017 Pan African Urological Surgeons Association.

Cognitive versus technical debriefing after simulation training,ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE,"Background: Recent literature describes cognitive dispositions to respond (CDRs) that may lead physicians to err in their clinical reasoning. Objectives: To assess learner perception of high-fidelity mannequin-based simulation and debriefing to improve understanding of CDRs. Methods: Emergency medicine (EM) residents were exposed to two simulations designed to bring out the CDR concept known as vertical line failure. Residents were then block-randomized to a technical/knowledge debriefing covering the medical subject matter or a CDR debriefing covering vertical line failure. They then completed a written survey and were interviewed by an ethnographer. Four investigators blinded to group assignment reviewed the interview transcripts and coded the comments. The comments were qualitatively analyzed and those upon which three out of four raters agreed were quantified. A random sample of 84 comments was assessed for interrater reliability using a kappa statistic. Results: Sixty-two residents from two EM residencies participated. Survey results were compared by technical (group A, n = 32) or cognitive (group B, n = 30) debriefing. There were 255 group A and 176 group B comments quantified. The kappa statistic for coding the interview comments was 0.42. The CDR debriefing group made more, and qualitatively richer, comments regarding CDR concepts. The technical debriefing group made more comments on the medical subjects of cases. Both groups showed an appreciation for the risk of diagnostic error. Conclusions: Survey data indicate that technical debriefing was better received than cognitive debriefing. The authors theorize that an understanding of CDRs can be facilitated through simulation training based on the analysis of interview comments."
Effectiveness of Debriefing for Meaningful Learning-based simulation training on high-risk neonatal care: A randomized controlled simulation study,CLINICAL SIMULATION IN NURSING,"Background: This study compared Debriefing for Meaningful Learning (c) (DML) and the Gather-Analyze-Summarize (GAS) method during high-risk neonate simulation training for nursing students. Methods: From October to December 2020, 60 students were assigned to experimental (DML; n = 32) and control (GAS; n = 28) groups. Weeks one and two included pre-simulation briefing and practice. Weeks three and four included simulations and debriefing. Results: Knowledge, metacognitive strategy, problem-solving skills, and clinical reasoning significantly improved in the experimental group. Problem-solving ability improved more significantly in the experimental group, compared with the control group. Conclusions: DML effectively increases nursing students' problem-solving abilities.

An environment for the development and presentation of computerized cases to learn diagnostic reasoning,ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Computer-based clinical simulations are widely accepted as an instrument in learning diagnostic reasoning. Similar to other learning resources, these programs can be acquired commercially. However, none of the simulations we know of are fully compatible with Dutch medical practice. Therefore, we have developed a program to present cases that better fit our curriculum. In this program cases are grouped in complaint domains, where all patients have similar basic complaints. Using this program students can explore their ability to apply medical knowledge in an interdisciplinary, problem-based setting. Learning is enhanced by additional learning activities. Each case, for example, is concluded by a short tutorial, linking case findings to underlying pathophysiological processes and emphasizing findings that are important to differentiate between alternative diagnoses. The program is easily extensible and adaptable, both with respect to complaint domains and cases."
Medical (emergency) decisions and how to avoid mistakes,NOTFALL & RETTUNGSMEDIZIN,"Awareness with respect to diagnostic and therapeutic errors in medicine continues to rise. For a deeper understanding of errors, it is crucial to consider the cognitive processes underlying decision making, especially in emergency medicine. Clinical reasoning is based on the simultaneous activation of two different cognitive systems: a fast, intuitive (system 1) and a slow systematic-analytic one (system 2). In emergency medicine, the highly reactive system 1 is of major importance but bears a risk of bias. False decisions may be explained by cognitive and affective biases and system-related errors (working environment, team- and patient-related factors, limited resources). Most of the errors could be prevented by using cognitive strategies such as de-biasing and rule-out-worst-case-scenarios (ROWS) strategies, as well as with feedback from debriefings and simulation trainings, or morbidity and mortality (M&M) rounds and critical incident reporting systems."
VIRTUAL PATIENT SIMULATION TO TEACH CLINICAL REASONING AND REDUCE DIAGNOSTIC ERROR,JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE,
Virtual interactive Practice (TM): Utilising healthcare information systems to contextualise the skills associated with clinical decision making within nurse education,"MEDINFO 2004: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 11TH WORLD CONGRESS ON MEDICAL INFORMATICS, PT 1 AND 2",This paper reports on a Virtual Interactive Practice (TM) (VIP) project that has the potential to revolutionise the educational delivery and learning of clinical skills complementing real' practice. The focus is currently on nurse learning but the principles could equally be applied to multi and inter-professional learning and clinical decision-making. This project represents a new model to enhance clinical skill acquisition and clinical reasoning using a structured competency base. Integral to this is a strong partnership between education and practice utilising 'real' live and recorded anonymised patient data from a critical care clinical information system (CIS) within a large district general hospital to structure scenarios fostering problem-based learning. This educational practice interface enables the synthesis of clinical data using virtual technology and sophisticated scenario-based simulation within a skills laboratory. The aim is to enhance the more ad hoc system of learning within conventional practice placements. Early findings suggest that VIP (TM) enhances practice providing a safe but challenging learning experience with the benefit of instant performance feedback to students.
Embedding Patient Simulation in a Pediatric Cardiology Rotation: A Unique Opportunity for Improving Resident Education,CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE,"ObjectiveHigh-fidelity patient simulation (HFPS) has been used in medical education to bridge gaps in medical knowledge and clinical skills. Few studies have analyzed the impact of HFPS in subspecialty rotations for pediatric residents. We hypothesized that pediatric residents exposed to HFPS with a structured content curriculum would perform better on a case quiz than residents without exposure to HFPS. DesignProspective randomized controlled SettingTertiary-care free standing children's hospital InterventionsDuring a cardiology rotation, senior pediatric residents completed an online pediatric cardiology curriculum and a cardiology quiz. After randomization into two groups, the study group participated in a fully debriefed HFPS session. The control group had no HFPS. Outcome MeasureBoth groups completed a case quiz. Confidence surveys pre- and postsimulation were completed. ResultsFrom October 2010 through March 2013, 55 residents who rotated through the pediatric cardiology rotation were used in the final analysis (30 control, 25 in the study group). There was no significant difference between groups on the initial cardiology quiz. The study group scored higher on the case quiz compared with the control group (P = .024). Based on pre- and postsimulation questionnaires, residents' confidence in approaching a pediatric cardiology patient improved from an average Likert score of 5.1 to 7.5 (on scale of 0-10) (P < .001). ConclusionsIncorporation of HFPS into a preexisting pediatric cardiology rotation was feasible and well received. Our study suggests that simulation promotes increased confidence and may modestly improve clinical reasoning compared to traditional educational techniques. Targeted simulation sessions may readily be incorporated into pediatric subspecialty rotations."
Assessment of Diagnostic Competences With Standardized Patients Versus Virtual Patients: Experimental Study in the Context of History Taking,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,"Background: Standardized patients (SPs) have been one of the popular assessment methods in clinical teaching for decades, although they are resource intensive. Nowadays, simulated virtual patients (VPs) are increasingly used because they are permanently available and fully scalable to a large audience. However, empirical studies comparing the differential effects of these assessment methods are lacking. Similarly, the relationships between key variables associated with diagnostic competences (ie, diagnostic accuracy and evidence generation) in these assessment methods still require further research. Objective: The aim of this study is to compare perceived authenticity, cognitive load, and diagnostic competences in performance-based assessment using SPs and VPs. This study also aims to examine the relationships of perceived authenticity, cognitive load, and quality of evidence generation with diagnostic accuracy. Methods: We conducted an experimental study with 86 medical students (mean 26.03 years, SD 4.71) focusing on history taking in dyspnea cases. Participants solved three cases with SPs and three cases with VPs in this repeated measures study. After each case, students provided a diagnosis and rated perceived authenticity and cognitive load. The provided diagnosis was scored in terms of diagnostic accuracy; the questions asked by the medical students were rated with respect to their quality of evidence generation. In addition to regular null hypothesis testing, this study used equivalence testing to investigate the absence of meaningful effects. Results: Perceived authenticity (1-tailed t(81)=11.12; P<.001) was higher for SPs than for VPs. The correlation between diagnostic accuracy and perceived authenticity was very small (r=0.05) and neither equivalent (P=.09) nor statistically significant (P=.32). Cognitive load was equivalent in both assessment methods (t(82)=2.81; P=.003). Intrinsic cognitive load (1-tailed r=-0.30; P=.003) and extraneous load (1-tailed r=-0.29; P=.003) correlated negatively with the combined score for diagnostic accuracy. The quality of evidence generation was positively related to diagnostic accuracy for VPs (1-tailed r=0.38; P<.001); this finding did not hold for SPs (1-tailed r=0.05; P=.32). Comparing both assessment methods with each other, diagnostic accuracy was higher for SPs than for VPs (2-tailed t(85)=2.49; P=.01). Conclusions: The results on perceived authenticity demonstrate that learners experience SPs as more authentic than VPs. As higher amounts of intrinsic and extraneous cognitive loads are detrimental to performance, both types of cognitive load must be monitored and manipulated systematically in the assessment. Diagnostic accuracy was higher for SPs than for VPs, which could potentially negatively affect students' grades with VPs. We identify and discuss possible reasons for this performance difference between both assessment methods."
In situ simulation: Identification of systems issues,SEMINARS IN PERINATOLOGY,"The Institute of Medicine's report, To Err is Human, concluded that medical errors are not a result of isolated individual actions but rather faulty systems, processes, and conditions that lead people to make mistakes. In situ simulation offers the unique opportunity to train the teams of people who deliver healthcare while enhancing policies, evaluating new technologies, and improving the systems that support the delivery of safe healthcare. For this reason, the Institute of Medicine, the Joint Commission, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality recommend medical simulation as one of the most important safe practice interventions to reduce errors and risks associated with the process of care. This review builds on other reports in this issue and discusses the application of in situ simulation to identify, address, and test systems improvements. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Students' Level of Satisfaction in Nursing Skills Demonstration: Basis for Designing Debriefing Strategies,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH & HEALTH SCIENCES,"Background: The use of laboratory in demonstrating nursing skills to enhance students competency will highly benefit in the transition of theory learned into the delivery of care to actual patients in the clinical field. It provides opportunities to practice the procedures, evaluate learning outcomes and reinforce reasoning objectives. Objective: The study aims to identify the level of satisfaction of nursing students in the skills demonstration in terms of debriefing and reflection, clinical reasoning and clinical learning. Methods: This study used the Quantitative-Descriptive design to describe the level of student satisfaction in nursing skills. Results: The results of the study showed that the majority of FCMS nursing students expressed high level of satisfaction according to level of respondents. Mean=3.81). Meanwhile, FCMS nursing expressed a high level of satisfaction in three categories debrief and reflection (Mean=3.77; chi(2)=90.796), clinical reasoning (Mean=3.80; chi(2)=77. 632) and clinical learning (Mean=3.86; chi(2)=93.285). Discussion: The results highlighted that the nursing students mostly benefited from clinical learning during skills demonstration. Conclusion: The study concludes that the nursing students of FCMS have a high level of satisfaction in nursing skills demonstrations in terms of clinical learning and clinical reasoning."
Utilizing High-Fidelity Crucial Conversation Simulation in Genetic Counseling Training,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART A,"Genetics professionals are often required to deliver difficult news to patients and families. This is a challenging task, but one that many genetics trainees have limited opportunity tomaster during training. This is true for several reasons, including relative scarcity of these events and an understandable hesitation of supervisors allowing a trainee to provide such high stakes information. Medical simulation is effective in other health care disciplines giving trainees opportunities of hands on education in similar high stakes situations. We hypothesized that crucial conversations simulation would be effective for genetics trainees to gain experience in communication and counseling skills in a realistic clinical scenario. To test this hypothesis, we designed a prenatal counseling scenario requiring disclosure of an abnormal amniocentesis result and discussion of pregnancy management options; we challenged participants to address common counseling questions. Three medical genetics resident physicians and five genetic counseling students participated. Genetics and simulation experts observed the session via live video feed from a different room. A behavioral checklist was completed in real time assessing trainee's performance and documenting medical information discussed. Debriefing immediately followed the session and included simulation and genetics experts and the actor parents. Participants completed open-ended post evaluations. There was a trend towards participants being more likely to discuss issues the child could have while an infant/toddler rather than issues that could emergeas the child with Down Syndrome transitions to adulthood and end of life (P = .069). All participants found the simulation helpful, notably that it was more realistic than role-playing with colleagues. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Self-confidence of medical students in performing clinical skills acquired during their surgical rotation Assessing clinical skills education in Kuwait,SAUDI MEDICAL JOURNAL,"Objective: To assess the self-confidence of clinical years' medical students in performing clinical skills/procedures. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in April 2011 at the Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Health Sciences Center, Kuwait University, Safat, Kuwait. A questionnaire was used to collect data from students who had completed their surgical rotation of their first clinical year. The students reported their level of self-confidence in performing specific skills/procedures related to that rotation. Data were presented using frequencies and percentages. A total score of confidence was calculated for each student. The Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to assess the association between the students' sociodemographic characteristics and confidence score. Results: Of the 122 students invited to participate in the study, only 15 (12.3%) declined to comply. Most students reported high confidence level (>75%) in performing 7 of the 13 history taking/physical examination skills, and 2 of the 39 diagnostic/treatment procedure skills. The highest confidence level was in performing abdominal examination, while the lowest level was in care of Jackson-Pratt drain site and emptying the drain bulb. The total confidence score was significantly higher among males (p=0.021), and students with higher monthly income (p=0.002). Conclusion: Medical students appeared to have poor self-confidence in performing clinical skills/procedures. Curriculum planners should explore potential reasons, and methods for the improvement of confidence level among medical students in performing skills/procedures they were expected to learn during their surgical rotation.

Unannounced in situ simulations: integrating training and clinical practice,BMJ QUALITY & SAFETY,"Simulation-based training for healthcare providers is well established as a viable, efficacious training tool, particularly for the training of non-technical team-working skills. These skills are known to be critical to effective teamwork, and important in the prevention of error and adverse events in hospitals. However, simulation suites are costly to develop and releasing staff to attend training is often difficult. These factors may restrict access to simulation training. We discuss our experiences of 'in situ' simulation for unannounced cardiac arrest training when the training is taken to the clinical environment. This has the benefit of decreasing required resources, increasing realism and affordability, and widening multidisciplinary team participation, thus enabling assessment and training of non-technical team-working skills in real clinical teams. While there are practical considerations of delivering training in the clinical environment, we feel there are many potential benefits compared with other forms of simulation training. We are able to tailor the training to the needs of the location, enabling staff to see a scenario that is relevant to their practice. This is particularly useful for staff who have less exposure to cardiac arrest events, such as radiology staff. We also describe the important benefit of risk assessment for a clinical environment. During our simulations we have identified a number of issues that, had they occurred during a real resuscitation attempt, may have led to patient harm or patient death. For these reasons we feel in situ simulation should be considered by every hospital as part of a patient safety initiative."
A Virtual Patient Representation in the Medical Rehabilitation Domain,EXPLORING COMPLEXITY IN HEALTH: AN INTERDISCIPLINARY SYSTEMS APPROACH,"This paper proposes a virtual patient (VP) for the medical rehabilitation domain using the digital representation of the real life patient's matchstick skeleton. This virtual patient is used to analyze and track the recovery of the orthopedic patient with malicious posture problems. The creation of the digital patient was realized using a markerless depth camera, the Microsoft Kinect. The gathered data was saved in to a BVH type motion capture file. This file records not only the skeletal structure of the patient but its movements as well from witch the adduction, rotation and flexion angles of the joints can be analyzed. The data is stored in structured text format making it suitable to be used in telemedicine. The results confirm the utility and usability of the digital patient in clinical reasoning and in educational applications."
Learning and teaching clinical communication in the clinical workplace,CLINICAL TEACHER,"Background : Clinical communication teaching and learning has become increasingly separate from the clinical workplace over the last 20 years in the UK, and in many medical schools is front-loaded to the early years of the curriculum. Many reasons exist to explain this separation, including the increasing use of simulation. However, learning by simulation alone is not ideal, and the literature now points towards a new direction that blends simulation with authentic experiences in the clinical workplace to aid the transition to clinical life. Context : This article presents a practical example of collaboration between a London medical school and a hospital trust to provide an integrated clinical communication learning experience for students by situating teaching on the clinical wards for senior medical students. Innovation : We outline a new teaching initiative, the 'Communication on the wards' pilot project, that blends clinical communication teaching with ward-based learning in an authentic environment, with patients, medical students and teachers working together. Implications : This teaching initiative was a practical attempt to bridge the theory-practice gap in clinical communication education, and to place learning in the clinical work-place for students. As such, it was enjoyed by all those who took part, and may be the way forward for clinical communication teaching and learning in the future."
Implementing a Monte-Carlo simulation on admission decisions,JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT,"Purpose - Although very significant and applicable, there have been no formal justifications for the use of Monte-Carlo models and Markov chains in evaluating hospital admission decisions or concrete data supporting their use. For these reasons, this research was designed to provide a deeper understanding of these models. The purpose of this paper is to examine the usefulness of a computerized Monte-Carlo simulation of admission decisions under the constraints of emergency departments. Design/methodology/approach - The authors construct a simple decision tree using the expected utility method to represent the complex admission decision process terms of quality adjusted life years ( QALY) then show the advantages of using a Monte-Carlo simulation in evaluating admission decisions in a cohort simulation, using a decision tree and a Markov chain. Findings - After showing that the Monte-Carlo simulation outperforms an expected utility method without a simulation, the authors develop a decision tree with such a model. real cohort simulation data are used to demonstrate that the integration of a Monte-Carlo simulation shows which patients should be admitted. Research limitations/implications - This paper may encourage researchers to use Monte-Carlo simulation in evaluating admission decision implications. The authors also propose applying the model when using a computer simulation that deals with various CVD symptoms in clinical cohorts. Originality/value - Aside from demonstrating the value of a Monte-Carlo simulation as a powerful analysis tool, the paper's findings may prompt researchers to conduct a decision analysis with a Monte-Carlo simulation in the healthcare environment."
Correlates of Student Performance during Low Stakes Simulation,JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL NURSING,"Background: Simulation plays a vital role in nursing education, however, modifiable factors influencing students' simulation performance have not been sufficiently examined. The purpose of this study was examine relationships among anxiety, self-efficacy, nursing knowledge, and performance during simulation. Methods: The study used a mixed-methods design. Anxiety, self-efficacy, academic achievement, and performance during simulation were measured quantitatively; correlations between key variables were calculated. Qualitative data were collected during post-simulation debriefing and triangulated to inform quantitative findings. Results: Significant relationships were identified between knowledge of nursing care and simulation performance. Student qualitative reports of heightened anxiety and lack of confidence and uncertainty contrasted from quantitative measures. Potential reasons for this finding were explored. Conclusions: The relationship between knowledge of nursing care and simulation performance supports the effectiveness of simulation as a means to evaluate the application of knowledge in a clinical laboratory setting. Further research is needed to explain the complex relationships between anxiety, self-efficacy, and performance during simulation."
Virtu@l consult@tion: An interactive learning environment for remote medical learning,Proceedings of the Eighth IASTED International Conference on Computers and Advanced Technology in Education,"One of the main goals in medical studies is to develop clinical reasoning skills, using the Clinical Reasoning Learning (CRL) method. CLR is a collaborative and situated learning method, based on the simulation of a medical consultation. However, during the training periods, the physical distance that separates teachers and their students, makes it difficult for the organization of these CLR sessions. The purpose of this study is to use computers during CLR sessions. On the one hand, this allows teachers and students to simulate remote medical consultations. On the other hand, this enables the use of multimedia medical data closer to formats that students will find in their professional life. In this paper, we define the communication form within a cooperative work group during a CRL session. Next, we analyze them in order to support effectively remote communication. We present Vinu@1 Consult@tion, an interactive, collaborative and multimedia learning environment created to support remote CRL sessions. Finally, we describe the first experience of Vintt@1 Consult@tion and the results of its evaluation. Virtu@1 Considt@tion will be integrated in the French Virtual Medical University project, and is intended to be used for undergraduate, internships, residency or continuing medical education."
The impact of the Virtual Ophthalmology Clinic on medical students' learning: a randomised controlled trial,EYE,"Aim The Virtual Ophthalmology Clinic (VOC) is an interactive web-based teaching module, with special emphasis on history taking and clinical reasoning skills. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of VOC on medical students' learning. Methods A randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted with medical students from the University of Sydney (n = 188) who were randomly assigned into either an experimental (n = 93) or a control group (n = 95). A pre- and post-test and student satisfaction questionnaire were administered. Twelve months later a follow-up test was conducted to determine the long-term retention rate of graduates. Results There was a statistically significant (P<0.001) within-subject improvement preto post rotation in the number of correctly answered questions for both the control and experimental groups (mean improvement for control 10%, 95% CI 1.3-2.6, and for experimental 17.5%, 95% CI 3.0-4.0). The improvement was significantly greater in the experimental group (mean difference in improvement between groups 7.5%, 95% CI 0.8-2.3, P<0.001). At 12 months follow-up testing, the experimental group scored on average 1.6 (8%) (95% CI 0.4 to 2.7, P = 0.007) higher than the controls. Conclusion On the basis of a statistically significant improvement in academic performance and highly positive student feedback, the implementation of VOC may provide a means to address challenges to ophthalmic learning outcomes in an already crowded medical curriculum."
From Learning Psychiatry to Becoming Psychiatrists: A Qualitative Study of Co-constructive Patient Simulation,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,"Objectives: Co-constructive patient simulation (CCPS) is a novel medical education approach that provides a participatory and emotionally supportive alternative to traditional supervision and training. CCPS can adapt iteratively and in real time to emergent vicissitudes and challenges faced by clinicians. We describe the first implementation of CCPS in psychiatry. Methods: We co-developed clinical scripts together with child and adolescent psychiatry senior fellows and professional actors with experience performing as simulated patients (SPs). We conducted the simulation sessions with interviewers blind to the content of case scenarios enacted by the SPs. Each hour-long simulation was followed by an hour-long debriefing session with all participants. We recorded and transcribed case preparation, simulation interactions, and debriefing sessions, and analyzed anonymized transcripts through qualitative analysis within a constructivist framework, aided by NVivo software. Results: Each of six CCPS sessions was attended by a median of 13 participants (range, 11-14). The first three sessions were conducted in person; the last three, which took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, via synchronized videoconferencing. Each of the sessions centered on clinically challenging and affectively charged situations informed by trainees' prior experiences. Through iterative thematic analysis we derived an alliterating 9R model centered on three types of Reflection: (a) in action/while doing (Regulate, Relate, and Reason); (b) on action/having done (Realities, Restraints, and Relationships); and (c) for action/will be doing (with opportunities for Repair and Reaffirmation). Conclusions: CCPS is an experiential approach that fosters autonomous, meaningful, and individually tailored learning opportunities. CCPS and the 9R model for reflective practice can be effectively applied to psychiatry and have the potential to contribute uniquely to the educational needs of its trainees and practitioners."
Ceftazidime dosage regimen in intensive care unit patients: from a population pharmacokinetic approach to clinical practice via Monte Carlo simulations,BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,"AIM To predict the ceftazidime dosage regimen as a function of the glomerular filtration rate expressed by the modification of the diet in renal disease (MDRD), reason for admission and mechanical ventilation in intensive care unit (ICU) patients to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia. METHOD A published and qualified population pharmacokinetic model was used to perform Monte Carlo simulations of ceftazidime concentrations. The serum target of 40-100 mg l-1 was defined based on the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), the European break point (EBP), the pulmonary drug diffusion and toxicity. The recommended dosage regimens were based on the maximum percentile of the patients with simulated steady state concentrations reaching the target. RESULTS Steady-state was reached at 72 h whatever the MDRD. The simulations of serum concentrations generated higher percentiles of the population reaching the target after continuous administration. We recommend a 4 g continuous dose after the usual 2 g loading dose for patients with MDRD from 10 to 30 ml min-1, 6 g for MDRD between 40 and 80 ml min-1, 8 g for MDRD from 90 to 110 ml min-1, 10 g for MDRD from 120 to 190 ml min-1 and 12 g day-1 for patients with MDRD higher than 200 ml min-1. CONCLUSION Our study demonstrated that in ICU patients for a given MDRD, steady-state takes longer to reach in polytrauma patients than in patients with medical or post surgery reasons for admission. Continuous infusion ensures that a higher percentage of patients reaches the target than the same dose given by discontinuous administration and this only depends on MDRD."
EFFECT OF INTENSIVE-CARE SIMULATION ON ANXIETY OF NURSING-STUDENTS IN THE CLINICAL ICU,HEART & LUNG,"Objective: To determine the effect of a campus critical care simulation on anxiety of nursing students in the clinical intensive care unit. Design: Quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design using a sample of convenience. Setting: Large Midwestern university. Subjects: Second semester, junior level nursing students enrolled in a generic baccalaureate nursing program. Students currently enrolled in an adult medical-nursing course with one allotted day for a campus critical care laboratory and a clinical day in affiliated community hospitals. Outcome measures: Reduction in anxiety, as measured by the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, related to psychomotor skill performance in a highly technological clinical setting. Intervention: Campus critical care simulation laboratory, which provided time for information, demonstration, discussion, practice, and validation of performance skills associated with technology in a usual critical care setting. Results: There was no significant difference in anxiety scores of subjects who received a campus critical care simulation before attending an actual clinical critical care experience versus those students who did not (t = 1.70, p = 0.094). There was no significant difference in anxiety scores of the experimental group after attending a campus simulation (t = 1. 18, p = 0.250). Attending a campus critical care experience did not result in a decrease in critical care clinical setting anxiety. Conclusions: There are numerous reasons why students experience anxiety in the clinical setting, one of which is anxiety related to task performance. Although familiarity with psychomotor skills is beneficial, study findings indicate that familiarity with psychomotor skills is not sufficient to decrease anxiety in the critical care clinical setting."
Counterfactual Reasoning Deficits in Schizophrenia Patients,PLOS ONE,"Background Counterfactual thinking is a specific type of conditional reasoning that enables the generation of mental simulations of alternatives to past factual events. Although it has been broadly studied in the general population, research on schizophrenia is still scarce. The aim of the current study was to further examine counterfactual reasoning in this illness. Methods Forty schizophrenia patients and 40 controls completed a series of tests that assessed the influence of the causal order effect on counterfactual thinking, and the ability to generate counterfactual thoughts and counterfactually derive inferences from a hypothetical situation. Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as neurocognitive variables, were also examined. Results Compared to controls, the schizophrenia patients generated fewer counterfactual thoughts when faced with a simulated scenario. The pattern of response when assessing the causality effect of the order was also different between the groups, with the patients being more frequently unable to attribute any ordering of events than the control subjects. Additionally, the schizophrenia patients showed more difficulties when deriving normative counterfactual inferences from hypothetical social situations. None of the counterfactual reasoning measures was associated to any of the cognitive functions or clinical and socio-demographic variables assessed. Conclusions A global impairment in counterfactual thinking characterizes schizophrenia patients. Because of the potential impact of such deficits on psychosocial functioning, targeting counterfactual reasoning for improvement might be considered in future treatment approaches."
Simulation-based learning and internal medicine: Opportunities and current perspectives for a national harmonized program,REVUE DE MEDECINE INTERNE,"Simulation-based learning (SBL) is developing rapidly in France and the question of its use in the teaching of internal medicine (IM) is essential. While HAS encourages its integration into medical education, French Young Internists (Ail) set up a working group to reflect on the added-value of this tool in our specialty. Different sorts of SBL exist: human, synthetic and electronic. It enables student to acquire and evaluate technical skills (strengths, invasive procedures, etc.) and non-technical skills (relational, reasoning...). The debriefing that follows the simulation session is an essential time in pedagogical terms. It enables the acquisition of knowledge by encouraging the students' reflection to reshape their reasoning patterns by self-correcting. IM interns are supportive of its use. The simulation would allow young internists to acquire skills specific to our specialty such as certain gestures, complex consulting management, the synthesis of difficult clinical cases. SBL remains confronted with human and financial cost issues. The budgets allocated to the development and maintenance of simulation centres are uneven, making the supply of training unequal on the territory. Simulation sessions are time-consuming and require teacher training. Are faculties ready to train and invest their time in simulation, even though the studies do not allow us to conclude on its pedagogical validity?

Expressions of critical thinking in role-playing simulations: comparisons across roles,JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN HIGHER EDUCATION,"The development of critical thinking is crucial in professional education to augment the capabilities of pre-professional students. One method for enhancing critical thinking is participation in role-playing simulation-based scenarios where students work together to resolve a potentially real situation. In this study, undergraduate nursing students were divided into small groups (2-3) to role-play a medical emergency (stroke) within a high fidelity simulation environment. The research team utilized a cross-case comparison design; cases were defined by the different roles played by the nursing students (e.g., primary nurse, secondary nurse, and family member). Results indicated that although students in all three roles displayed instances of reflection, contextual perspective, and logical reasoning, these were not distributed evenly across roles, with family members demonstrating fewer instances of reflection and logical reasoning and secondary nurses demonstrating fewer instances of contextual perspective. However, evidence of students' abilities to apply clinical standards was observed fairly equally across all three roles. Implications for the use of role-plays within high-fidelity simulations are discussed."
Mobile emergency simulation training for rural health providers,RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH,"Introduction: Mobile emergency simulation offers innovative continuing medical educational support to regions that may lack access to such opportunities. Furthermore, satisfaction is a critical element for active learning. Together, the authors evaluated Canadian rural healthcare providers' satisfaction from high fidelity emergency simulation training using a modified motorhome as a mobile education unit (MEU). Methods: Over a 5-month period, data was collected during 14 educational sessions in nine different southern Manitoban communities. Groups of up to five rural healthcare providers managed emergency simulation cases including polytrauma, severe sepsis, and inferior myocardial infarction with right ventricular involvement, followed by a debrief. Participants anonymously completed a feedback form that contained 11 questions on a five-point Likert scale and six short-answer questions. Results: Data from 131 respondents were analyzed, for a response rate of 75.6%. Respondents included nurses (27.5%), medical residents (26.7%), medical first responders (16.0%), and physicians (12.2%). The median response was 5 for overall quality of learning, development of clinical reasoning skills and decision-making ability, recognition of patient deterioration, and self-reflection. The post-simulation debrief median response was also 5 for summarizing important issues, constructive criticism, and feedback to learn. Respondents also reported that the MEU provided a believable working environment (87.0%, n=114), they had limited or no previous access to high fidelity mannequins (82.7%, n=107), and they had no specific training in crisis resource management or were unfamiliar with the term (92%, n=118). Conclusions: A high level of satisfaction was reported in rural health providers with mobile emergency simulation. Access to and experience with high fidelity mannequins was limited, suggesting areas for potential educational growth."
Counterfactual Reasoning in Non-psychotic First-Degree Relatives of People with Schizophrenia,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,"Counterfactual thinking (GFT) is a type of conditional reasoning that enables the generation of mental simulations of alternatives to past factual events. Previous research has found this cognitive feature to be disrupted in schizophrenia (Hooker et al., 2000; Contreras et al., 2016). At the same time, the study of cognitive deficits in unaffected relatives of people with schizophrenia has significantly increased, supporting its potential endophenotypic role in this disorder. Using an exploratory approach, the current study examined CFT for the first time in a sample of non-psychotic first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients (N = 43), in comparison with schizophrenia patients (N = 54) and healthy controls (N = 44). A series of tests that assessed the causal order effect in CFT and the ability to generate counterfactual thoughts and counterfactually derive inferences using the Counterfactual Inference Test was completed. Associations with variables of basic and social cognition, levels of schizotypy and psychotic-like experiences in addition to clinical and socio-demographic characteristics were also explored. Findings showed that first-degree relatives generated a lower number of counterfactual thoughts than controls, and were more adept at counterfactually deriving inferences, specifically in the scenarios related to regret and to judgments of avoidance in an unusual situation. No other significant results were found. These preliminary findings suggest that non-psychotic first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients show a subtle disruption of global counterfactual thinking compared with what is normally expected in the general population. Due to the potential impact of such deficits, new treatments targeting OFT improvement might be considered in future management strategies."
Investigating the reason for loss-of-function of Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) caused by Y279C mutation through molecular dynamics simulation,JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS,"Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML), formerly known as LEOPARD syndrome (LS), is an autosomal dominant inherited multisystemic disorder. Most patients involve mutation in SHP2 encoded by tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 11 (PTPN11) gene. Studies have shown that NSML-associated Y279C mutation exhibited the reduced phosphatase activity, leading to loss-of-function (LOF) of SHP2. However, the effect of the Y279C mutation on the SHP2 at the molecular level is unclear. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations of SHP2 wild-type (SHP2(WT)) and Y279C mutant (SHP2(Y279C)) were performed to investigate the structural differences in proteins after Y279C mutation and to find out the reason for loss-of-function of SHP2. Through a series of post-dynamic analyses, it was found that the protein occupied a smaller phase space after Y279C mutation, showing reduced flexibility. Specifically, due to the mutation of Y279C, the secondary structures of these two regions (residues Lys70-Ala72 and Gly462-Arg465) were significantly transformed from Turn to alpha-helix and beta-strand. Furthermore, by calculating the residue interaction network, hydrogen bond occupancy and binding free energy, it was further revealed that the conformational differences between SHP2(WT) and SHP2(Y279C) systems were mainly caused by the differences in the interaction between Arg465-Phe469, Ile463-Gly467, Cys279-Lys70, Cys459-Ala72, Gly464-Phe71, Phe71-Ile463, Ile463-Ala505 and Arg465-Glu361. Consequently, this finding is expected to provide a new insight into the reason for loss-of-function of SHP2 caused by Y279C mutation. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma"
Computer aided fuzzy medical diagnosis,INFORMATION SCIENCES,"This paper describes a fuzzy approach to computer aided medical diagnosis in a clinical context. It introduces a formal view of diagnosis in clinical settings and shows the relevance and possible uses of fuzzy cognitive maps and fuzzy logic. A constraint satisfaction method is introduced which uses the temporal uncertainty in symptom durations that may occur with particular diseases. Together with fuzzy symptom descriptions, the method results in an estimate of the stage of a disease if the temporal constraints of the disease in relation to the occurrence of the symptoms are satisfied. The approach is evaluated through simulation experiments showing the effects of symptom ordering, temporal uncertainty and symptom strengths on the diagnosis efficiency. The method is effective and can be developed further using second order (Type 2) fuzzy logic to better represent uncertainty in the clinical context thus improving differential diagnosis accuracy.

A Medical Decision Support System for the Prediction of the Coronary Artery Disease Using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps,"CREATIVITY IN INTELLIGENT TECHNOLOGIES AND DATA SCIENCE, (CIT&DS)","There is a lot discussion nowadays regarding the decision-making problem. The Making decisions and creating computational models using the tools of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps and Neural Systems is presented. The reason is that the contributing factors are several and complicated themselves. The medical problem of coronary artery disease (CAD) is considered and briefly presented. In medicine, factors such as age, symptoms, clinical tests all play their role and have their own importance when it comes to examine a patient, or to decide action. The development of a Medical Decision Support System (MDSS) using fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) for the first time to study the coronary artery disease (CAD) is formulated. A number of physician experts were used in developing a FCM with thirty concepts. Medical data from a number of real cases were used and simulations were conducted. Interesting results were obtained and discussed. Future directions for this medical application are provided."
Teaching Medical Students About Health Systems Science and Osteopathic Principles and Practice Using a Virtual World: The Envision Community Health Center,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN OSTEOPATHIC ASSOCIATION,"Medical education technology initiatives can be used to prepare osteopathic medical students for modern primary care practice and to provide students with training to serve vulnerable populations. Over academic years 2014 through 2017, the authors designed and implemented 26 case studies using patient simulations through a virtual community health center (CHC). First-year students, who were preparing for clinical training in CHCs, and second-year students, who were training in CHCs, completed the simulation case studies, gaining practice in clinical reasoning, Health Systems Science, and applied osteopathic principles and practice. This article explains the project, illustrates an alignment with Health Systems Science and osteopathic competencies, and highlights findings from previous research studies."
The randomized placebo-phase design for clinical trials,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY,"Randomized controlled trials are the criterion standard method for evaluating the effectiveness of medical treatments. There are situations, however, where the possibility of being in the control group in a randomized controlled trial is unacceptable to potential subjects or their physicians. This lack of acceptance is a reason for poor accrual. We developed and validated a new clinical trial design for survival data that may allay concerns about not receiving an investigational product and should be more acceptable. Called the randomized placebo-phase design, this new design asks whether, on average, those subjects who begin active treatment sooner respond sooner than those who begin it later. Using Monte Carlo computer simulations, we demonstrated that the design is valid and may offer advantages over traditional randomized controlled trials in some situations. The randomized placebo-phase design may be especially useful when highly potent therapies for rare diseases are tested or when accrual may be otherwise difficult. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

The case for simulation as part of a comprehensive patient safety program,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY,"Simulation in obstetrics allows us to practice in a safe environment. Simulations can improve the performance of individuals and obstetric teams. The evidence is overwhelming that, with simulated practice, obstetricians improve their technical and communication skills. Evidence is emerging that simulation ultimately may improve clinical outcomes. It stands to reason that simulation in obstetrics should be incorporated into comprehensive patient safety programs."
THE IMPACT OF SIMULATION TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR COMMUNICATION SKILLS ON THE MOTIVATIONAL LEVELS OF THE STUDENTS IN NURSING,EDULEARN15: 7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES,"Communication is the foundation of nursing. Nursing is a profession based on knowledge and skills and for this reason effective communication is essential for a successful nursing process. The purpose of the comprehension/response process, concerning the nurses, is not to fix people as if you solved a problem, but to explore the mystery that is the other person. Communication requires an understanding of other people's background and this understanding can make the two people involved to overcome the limits imposed by the relationship between them and to establish a genuine dialogue. Through communication the uniqueness of the individual can be revealed. The student must be able to initiate, encourage and maintain proper communication with the patient in a clear manner, without any ambiguity. The students in the first year at the Fundeni Sanitary Post High School Bucharest, Romania have participated in this study. There were questionnaires applied to 80 students, as well as questionnaires concerning the level of satisfaction applied to the patients with which the students interacted in a real hospital environment. The participants were randomly divided into two groups and were given 60 hours of theory for the Professional Communication module and 60 hours of theory for the Administering medication module. The students in the target group did their clinical practice after the simulation of a training program in communication skills and received an immediate response to the questionnaire from patients, while the students in the control group did their clinical practice without participating in this program and received the answer to the questionnaire from the patients at the end of the clinical training. Conclusions: We should notice that the students who have benefited from the simulation program before the clinical stage, as well as from the immediate answer to the questionnaire from patients, have lower levels of anxiety, higher levels of self-efficacy, increased self-confidence, increased quality of care, and present some progress in educational communication and motivation. The study proved that the patient's immediate response had an important impact on student performance and stimulated them to learn. The data revealed that teamwork and satisfaction are positively influenced by the simulation programs in communication skills and have a major importance in the quality of education for nurses."
Connecting a simulated virtual patient program with experiential practicums: Perspectives from year three students,CURRENTS IN PHARMACY TEACHING AND LEARNING,"Background and purpose: Research indicates that the simulated learning tools known as virtual patients (VPs) are valued by pharmacy students and impact students' knowledge and confidence. However, research is needed to understand how students can be supported to make intended con-nections between VP cases and real-life clinical scenarios. The purpose of this study was to exam-ine whether and how VP cases influence students' clinical reasoning skills, confidence, thought processes, and preparedness for their experiential practicums. Educational activity and setting: Third-year entry-to-practice doctor of pharmacy students who had completed at least one VP case in second year prior to their experiential practicums were sur-veyed in fall 2018 after having completed their experiential practicums. Surveys were structured to solicit student perceptions related to how students bridged VP cases and real-life clinical scenarios and were analyzed using a mixed-methods design. Findings: Forty-three students completed the survey. Students perceived that VP cases most signif-icantly impacted their clinical reasoning skills due to the opportunity cases afforded them to ex-plore patient data and navigate relevant information. The largest limitation of VP cases to students' learning was that the cases differed from their experiences. Students' suggestions included opportunities for more practice using VP cases and an expanded repertoire of medical conditions offered through case exposure. Summary: More research is needed to understand how to help students connect VP cases to their experiential practicums to make them more effective learning tools. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Interprofessional education and practice guide No. 9: Sustaining interprofessional simulation using change management principles,JOURNAL OF INTERPROFESSIONAL CARE,"Collaboration between teams is an essential component of patient safety in the complex ever-changing environment of healthcare. Collaborative practice requires training, which needs to start prior to registration for it to be established in the clinical workforce by graduation. Despite the perceived value and motivation of course coordinators, interprofessional training programs often struggle to sustain, due to various reasons related to logistics of timetabling, staff availability and/or absence of institutional support. We present a guide, outlining the lessons learned from implementing a sustainable change from our 6-year experience of the Women's Health Interprofessional Learning through Simulation (WHIPLS) program. The WHIPLS program was initially piloted to teach clinical skills in an interprofessional environment for pre-registration medical and midwifery students and has become a core component of the clinical curriculum. We describe the steps that were required to attain this outcome using the Kotter's 8-step plan for management change. The key lessons learned were identifying overlaps in course curriculum, planning for leadership and implementation, creating institutional buy-in, aligning with national goals, focusing on the learner, translating into routine clinical practice, keeping the program simple, accepting innovation and considering a strategic evaluation."
Development and Pilot of Case Manager: A Virtual-Patient Experience for Veterinary Students,JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EDUCATION,"There is an increasing demand in veterinary education to engage students, teach and reinforce clinical reasoning, and provide access anytime/anywhere to quality learning opportunities. In addition, accrediting bodies are asking for more concrete documentation of essential clinical-skills outcomes. Unfortunately, during the clinical year in a referral hospital setting, students are at the mercy of chance regarding the types of cases they will encounter and the opportunities they will have to participate. Patient- and case-simulation technology is becoming more popular as a way to achieve these objectives in human and veterinary medical education. Many of the current options available to the veterinary medical education community to develop virtual-patient cases are too time-consuming, cost prohibitive, or difficult for the instructor or learner to use. In response, we developed a learning tool, Case Manager, which is low-cost and user-friendly. Case Manager was designed to meet the demands of veterinary education by providing students with an opportunity to cultivate clinical reasoning skills and allowing for real-time student feedback. We launched a pilot test with 37 senior veterinary medical students as part of their Small Animal Internal Medicine clinical rotation. Students reported that Case Manager increased their engagement with the material, improved diagnostic and problem-solving skills, and broadened their exposure to a variety of cases. In addition, students felt that Case Manager was superior to a more traditional, less interactive case presentation format."
Automatic Keyword Extraction from Medical and Healthcare Curriculum,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2016 FEDERATED CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS (FEDCSIS),"Medical and healthcare study programmes are quite complicated in terms of branched structure and heterogeneous content. In logical sequence a lot of requirements and demands placed on students appear there. This paper focuses on an innovative way how to discover and understand complex curricula using modern information and communication technologies. We introduce an algorithm for curriculum metadata automatic processing-automatic keyword extraction based on unsupervised approaches, and we demonstrate a real application during a process of innovation and optimization of medical education. The outputs of our pilot analysis represent systematic description of medical curriculum by three different approaches (centrality measures) used for relevant keywords extraction. Further evaluation by senior curriculum designers and guarantors is required to obtain an objective benchmark."
Midwifery students' satisfaction with perinatal simulation-based training,WOMEN AND BIRTH,"Background: Simulation-based training has proved to be an effective teaching and learning approach in healthcare. Nevertheless, any assessment of its effectiveness should also take the students' perspective into account. Aim: To validate the Satisfaction with Simulation Experience Scale (SSES) for use with midwifery students and evaluate midwifery students' satisfaction with perinatal simulation-based training. Methods: Satisfaction with simulation was assessed using the SSES, a measurement tool translated from English to Dutch. Data was collected in four consecutive years (2016-19). A mixed methods design was used to capture both qualitative and quantitative data. Using the quantitative data, factor analysis was performed to assess the construct validity, while Cronbach's alpha was used to assess internal consistency. Qualitative data was assessed using thematic content analysis. Findings: 367 SSES questionnaires were completed by 251 students. The exploratory factor analysis resulted in a three-factor model covering debriefing and reflection, clinical reasoning and clinical learning. Cronbach's alpha showed good internal consistency. Students were very satisfied with perinatal simulation-based training for all three factors: 4.30 (SD = 0.47) for debriefing and reflection, 3.97 (SD = 0.55) for clinical reasoning and 4.10 (SD = 0.46) for clinical learning. Satisfaction scores remained high and stable over the years investigated. Thematic content analysis identified 6 categories: simulation-based training is valuable, the need for more simulation-based training, fidelity, students, negative feelings, and preparation is vital. Conclusion: Students were satisfied with the simulation-based training, experiencing it as providing added value to their education. Simulations gave them the opportunity to make and learn from mistakes in a safe learning environment. (c) 2020 Australian College of Midwives. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Neurocritical Care Unit Bed Allocation: Optimization Based on Prioritization Using Simulation,ARCHIVES OF NEUROSCIENCE,"Background: Neurological trauma and diseases are the second cause of mortality and the main reason of acquired disability. Neurocritical care plays a major role in treating such patients. A longer life expectancy, treatment of incurable diseases, and limited resources available to add to hospital beds necessitates engineering the knowledge of health systems to prioritize allocation of current resources and present a proper pattern. Objectives: The current study aimed at optimizing bed use and shortening the length of patients' hospitalization in neurocritical care unit (NCCU) of Loghman Hakim hospital affiliated to Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, and completely stimulating the procedure of bed allocation and prioritization of patients. Methods: Data of 420 patients hospitalized in NCCU was gathered and the procedure of bed allocation simulation was performed considering the priorities defined based on the length of hospitalization and patients' chance of survival. The PROMETHEE (preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation) method was used to prioritize and allocate beds. To study the consequences of the suggested method, event discrete simulation tool was used to compare the current status and the results of the new method for 20 periods each including one month data. Results: The mean number of patients admitted to NCCU during one month without any prioritization was 76, while it increased to 86 based on prioritization. Conclusions: Patients' simulation and prioritization using the PROMETHEE method resulted in 13% rise in the number of patients admitted to NCCU and higher utilization of this ward."
"Contrast-enhancement, image noise and dual-energy simulations for quantum-counting clinical CT",MEDICAL IMAGING 2010: PHYSICS OF MEDICAL IMAGING,The spectral sensitivity of quantum-counting detectors promises increased contrast-to-noise ratios and dual-energy capabilities for Computed Tomography (CT). In this article we quantify the benefits as well as the conceptual limitations of this technology under realistic clinical conditions. We present detailed simulations of a CT system with CdZnTe-based quantum-counting detector and compare to a conventional energy-integrating detector with Gd2O2S scintillator. Detector geometries and pixel layouts are adapted to specific requirements of clinical CT and its high-flux environment. The counting detector is realized as a two-threshold counter. An image-based method is used to adapt thresholds and data weights optimizing contrasts and image noise with respect to the typical spectra provided by modern high-power tungsten anode X-ray tubes. We consider the case of moderate X-ray fluxes and compare contrasts and image noise at same patient dose and image sharpness. We find that the spectral sensitivity of such a CT system offers dose reduction potentials of 31.5% (9.2%) maintaining Iodine-water contrast-to-noise ratios at 120kVp (80kVp). The improved contrast-to-noise ratios result mainly from improved contrasts and not from reduced image noise. The presence of fluorescence effects in the sensor material is the reason why image noise levels are not significantly reduced in comparison to energy-integrating systems. Dual-energy performance of quantum-counting single-source CT in terms of bone-Iodine separation is found to be somewhat below the level of today's dual-source CT devices with optimized pre-filtration of the X-ray beams.
Framework of Computer-Assisted Instruction and Clinical Decision Support System for Orthodontics with Case-Based Reasoning,"MEDICAL BIOMETRICS, PROCEEDINGS","Malocclusion is a very common oral disease. People with malocclusion often appeal to orthodontics for treatment. Since the treatment of orthodontics often takes several years, simulation and animation with 3D visual effect provides a good communication vehicle between patients and dentists before the treatment. In this paper, we developed a framework of CAI (computer assisted instruction) system with case-based reasoning for orthodontics. The system collects a lot of past cases of orthodontic and makes a 3D animation for each case, which simulates the moving and morphing from the pre- to the post-treatment. When a dentist encounters a new case, a past case will be selected based on the distance between the new case and the past one. A 3D animation of this most similar case will also be displayed. The system also incorporated pathological rules used for classifying the cases with different symptoms. Based on the rules, the search space for the similar cases can be reduced."
Process modelling and simulation for managing clinical care in the community,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,"'Care in the Community' is an easy catch phrase but a difficult goal It is a phrase that addresses a current growth area within health can? and one that comes complete with an impressive awry of political economic and social factors that would seem to support the notion of a continuing trend. Technology, specifically a information systems, however, has not been successfully cast in a supporting tale. There are marry reasons for this lack of success bust a major one is the mismatch between the understanding of what is required to support the clinical cam processes and the specifications of the current systems supplied[1]. Specifically the interest here is in the use and assessment of two computer science techniques i.e. process modelling and simulation, as suitable means of capturing and communicating requirements so as to bridge the divide and power differential between users and developers of information systems."
Nurse Practitioner Student Perceptions of Face-to-Face and Telehealth Standardized Patient Simulations,JOURNAL OF NURSING REGULATION,"Background: Telehealth standardized patient (SP) simulations offer a means of enhancing clinical education by providing nurse practitioner (NP) students with increased opportunities to interact with patients and develop a range of clinical skills, including conducting a telehealth visit, under the guidance of experienced faculty. Objective: Building on prior research comparing diagnostic reasoning outcomes in telehealth and face-to-face SP simulations, this study explored students' perceptions of the learning experience after participating in SP encounters using both modalities. Methods: Eighteen of the 41 students from the prior study participated in structured interviews. Guided by the tenets of a qualitative descriptive design, verbatim transcripts were analyzed using a thematic analysis process. Results: Three overarching themes were revealed: adapting practice strategies for telehealth encounters, inexperience with telehealth in education and practice, and the value of SP simulation for NP competency development. Lack of physical presence with the patient in the telehealth SP simulation and the need to rely on a nurse clinical presenter to conduct the physical examination affected the way students perceived and proceeded with the clinical encounter. Students' lack of familiarity and comfort with the telehealth SP simulation suggests the need for additional training to prepare them for this learning and care modality. Participants valued the opportunity to practice both clinical and telehealth skills, underscoring the importance of formative SP simulation in preparing NP students for successful transition to clinical practice. Conclusion: Our findings provide new evidence to guide nurse educators and regulators in considering this innovative teaching and learning modality to expand the use of simulation, augment clinical experiences, and better prepare future NPs for safe, effective practice in a technology-enabled healthcare system."
An integrative OSCE methodology for enhancing the traditional OSCE program at Taipei medical university ospital - a feasibility study,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background: Continuous development and use of new technologies and methodologies are key features in improving the learning, performance, and skills of medical students and students of all health care professions. Although significant improvements in teaching methodologies have been made in all areas of medicine and health care, studies reveal that students in many areas of health care taking an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) express difficulties. Thus, this study was planned as a feasibility study to assess the educational effectiveness of an integrated objective structured clinical examination (iOSCE) using both standardized patients and virtual patients. Methods: Thirty (30) medical students in their first year of internship at Taipei Medical University volunteered to be part of a feasibility study for demonstrating the concept of iOSCE. They divided themselves into five groups of six students each and were requested to evaluate two cases: 1) a patient with abdominal pain and 2) a patient with headache using a combination of a standardized patient and a virtual patient. For each of the two cases, five stations were designed in which students were given ten minutes per station leading to a final diagnosis and concluded with a debriefing. The five stations were: Station 1) Interacting with the standardized patient. Station 2) Writing the patient note and developing a differential diagnosis. Station 3) Selecting appropriate laboratory and imaging studies. Station 4) Making a final diagnosis and stating the evidence for it. Station 5) Having the debriefing. Each group of 6 students was assigned 2 hours per day for each case. All participants completed a survey regarding the usefulness and efficiency of the iOSCE. Results: All medical students (30/30; 100%) found the iOSCE program to be very satisfactory, and all expressed that they would like to have further iOSCE experiences if given the opportunity. In terms of ease and helpfulness, the students rated the program an average of 4.4 for the 1st case (abdominal pain) and 4.5 for the 2nd case (headache) on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being the highest and 1 being the lowest score. Conclusions: The participants felt that the iOSCE program can offer certain advantages over the traditional OSCE with the SP alone. They cited that the iOSCE provided improved clarity of what was being assessed as well as providing an opportunity to improve their diagnostic reasoning."
An overview of and approach to selecting appropriate patient representations in teaching and summative assessment in medical education,SWISS MEDICAL WEEKLY,"Medical education has a long tradition of using various patient representations in teaching and assessment. With this literature review we aim, first, to provide an overview of the most important patient representations used to teach and assess clinical skills, considering in particular summative exams that have a pass or fail outcome; second, to provide arguments for choosing certain patient representations; and third, to show the advantages and limitations of different patient representations, especially simulated patients (SPs) and real patients (RPs). Typical patient representations include case narratives, anatomical models, simulators and mannequins, as well as SPs and RPs. The literature indicates that there are multiple ways of using various patient representations in teaching and that the intended didactical purpose informs the choice of representation. Early in the educational programme, even low-fidelity patient representations can be a good fit for assessment purposes if chosen to match the educational level. The use of RPs in summative, high-stakes assessments (exams with particularly important consequences for the examinee) is limited for methodological and ethical reasons. The methodological implementation of summative exams also entails specific challenges, such as ensuring measurement reliability and fairness towards the examinees. Carefully prepared, SPs can perform their roles with a sufficient degree of authenticity, making summative exams more manageable, and imposing no strain or risk on RPs. The ongoing debate concerning the use of SPs and RPs in summative assessment highlights perceived limitations of SPs in relation to RPs that are often not supported by research. Evidence shows that SPs, in combination with additional simulation modalities as needed, represent the first choice for summative clinical assessment. We also consider the strengths and limitations of this review and reflect on the applicability of our findings. We conclude that in order to select the right patient representations in clinical teaching and/or assessment, a number of perspectives must be considered: (i) the learning goals, aligned with the stage of study, (ii) the corresponding requirements of the clinical task itself (e.g., performing a phlebotomy or a communication task), (iii) the level of authenticity required and (iv) the resources needed, taking patient safety and feasibility into consideration."
USAGE OF MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MEDICINE AND PHARMACY,ZDRAVNISKI VESTNIK-SLOVENIAN MEDICAL JOURNAL,"Background Modelling and simulation have become established methodology in explanation, analysis and prediction of systems operation and can therefore be met practically in all scientific disciplines including medicine and pharmacy. In spite of the fact that even in these two areas the nature of problems can differ drastically, developed methodology enables the usage of similar and systematically organised design techniques, where the cooperation with problem experts is of crucial importance. Conclusions In the paper some aspects regarding modelling and simulation in medicine and pharmacy are described. First in the introduction the basic terminology and reasons for using modelling and simulation as problem - solving techniques are given. Further, the main methodologies, including cyclic modelling activities, approaches in model construction and model representations are presented. The section is ending with experimental part of model solving, where the main attention is devoted to the continuous simulation. Presented ideas are illustrated through several simple and comprehensible examples which can frequently be met in the field of medicine and pharmacy. At the end also one more complex problem is introduced where predictive capabilities of modelling were illustrated for the study of influence of obesity to five different diseases, where also existing cross-couplings were taken into account. Modelling results have enabled economic evaluation of obesity treatment and the prediction of needed hospitalization and expenses regarding the absence from the work. Modelling and simulation can also in medicine and pharmacy explain and throw light upon complex clinical and therapeutic circumstances which can not be obtained from the clinical and experimental research data."
Emerging paradigms of cognition in medical decision-making,JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS,"The limitations of the classical or traditional paradigm of decision research are increasingly apparent, even though there has been a substantial body of empirical research on medical decision-making over the past 40 years. As decision-support technology continues to proliferate in medical settings, it is imperative that basic science decision research develop a broader-based and more valid foundation for the study of medical decision-making as it occurs in the natural setting. This paper critically reviews both traditional and recent approaches to medical decision making, considering the integration of problem-solving and decision-making research paradigms, the role of conceptual knowledge in decision-making, and the emerging paradigm of naturalistic decision-making. We also provide an examination of technology-mediated decision-making. Expanding the scope of decision research will better enable us to understand optimal decision processes, suitable coping mechanisms under suboptimal conditions, the development of expertise in decision-making, and ways in which decision-support technology can successfully mediate decision processes.

Advance Care Planning Norms May Contribute to Hospital Variation in End-of-Life ICU Use: A Simulation Study,MEDICAL DECISION MAKING,"Background. There is wide variation in end-of-life (EOL) intensive care unit (ICU) use among academic medical centers (AMCs). Our objective was to develop hypotheses regarding medical decision-making factors underlying this variation. Methods. This was a high-fidelity simulation experiment involving a critically and terminally ill elder, followed by a survey and debriefing cognitive interview and evaluated using triangulated quantitative-qualitative comparative analysis. The study was conducted in 2 AMCs in the same state and health care system with disparate EOL ICU use. Subjects were hospital-based physicians responsible for ICU admission decisions. Measurements included treatment plan, prognosis, diagnosis, qualitative case perceptions, and clinical reasoning. Results. Sixty-seven of 111 (60%) eligible physicians agreed to participate; 48 (72%) could be scheduled. There were no significant between-AMC differences in 3-month prognosis or treatment plan, but there were systematic differences in perceptions of the case. Case perceptions at the low-intensity AMC seemed to be influenced by the absence of a do-not-resuscitate order in the context of norms of universal code status discussion and documentation upon admission, whereas case perceptions at the high-intensity AMC seemed to be influenced by the patient's known metastatic gastric cancer in the context of norms of oncologists' avoiding code status discussions. Conclusions: In this simulation study of 2 AMCs, hospital-based physicians had different perceptions of an identical case. We hypothesize that different advance care planning norms may have influenced their decision-making heuristics."
"Complex clinical reasoning in the critical care - unit difficulties, pitfalls and adaptive strategies",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE,"Diagnostic error has implications for both clinical outcome and resource utilisation, and may often be traced to impaired data gathering, processing or synthesis because of the influence of cognitive bias. Factors inherent to the intensive/acute care environment afford multiple additional opportunities for such errors to occur. This article illustrates many of these with reference to a case encountered on our intensive care unit. Strategies to improve completeness of data gathering, processing and synthesis in the acute care environment are critically appraised in the context of early detection and amelioration of cognitive bias. These include reflection, targeted simulation training and the integration of social media and IT based aids in complex diagnostic processes. A framework which can be quickly and easily employed in a variety of clinical environments is then presented."
National Board of Medical Examiners and Curriculum Change: What Do Scores Tell Us? A Case Study at the University of Balamand Medical School,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL EDUCATION AND CURRICULAR DEVELOPMENT,"Objectives: This study describes the results of NBME (National Board of Medical Examiners) implementation in Balamand Medical School (BMS) from 2015 to 2019, after major curricular changes were introduced as of 2012. BMS students' performance was compared with the international USMLE step 1 (United States Medical Licensing Examination, herein referred to as step 1) cohorts' performances. The BMS students' NBME results were analyzed over the successive academic years to assess the impact of the serial curricular changes that were implemented. Methods: This longitudinal study describes the performance of BMS preclinical second year medicine (Med II) students on all their NBME exams over 4 academic years starting 2015-2016 to 2018-2019. These scores were compared with the step 1 comparison group scores using item difficulty. Thettest was computed for each of the NBME exams to check whether the scores' differences were significant. Results: Results revealed that all BMS cohorts scored lower than the international USMLE step 1 comparison cohorts in all disciplines across the 4 academic years except Psychiatry. However, the results were progressively approaching step 1 results, and the difference between step 1 scores and BMS students' NBME scores became closer and not significant as of year 4. Conclusions: The results of the study are promising. They show that the serial curricular changes enabled BMS Med II students' scores to reach the international cohorts' scores after 4 academic years. Moreover, the absence of statistical difference between cohort 4 scores and step 1 cohorts is not module dependent and applies to all clinical modules. Further studies should be conducted to assess whether the results obtained for cohort 4 can be maintained."
Daily nurse requirements planning based on simulation of patient flows,FLEXIBLE SERVICES AND MANUFACTURING JOURNAL,"Nurses account for approximately 50 % of total hospital budgets and their allocation to medical units and shifts can significantly affect the quality of care provided to patients. The adoption of flexible shift schedules and the assessment of actual nursing time can enable sensible resource planning, balancing the quality of care with efficiency in resource use. Starting from the concept that nurse requirements are triggered by patient needs, which are stochastic in nature both for clinical activities and their duration, this paper proposes an innovative Nurse Requirement Planning model grounded on the concept of the clinical pathway (the standard sequence of diagnostic, therapeutic and care activities a patient with certain pathology should undertake over time) with its inner routing probability and patient dependence on nurses, which can be correlated to the time needed to perform nursing tasks. In merging and modelling these two aspects, the method summarizes the best features of acuity-quality and timed-task/activity techniques, well known although not usually applied for reasons of demands on clinicians' time. Instead, in this paper, for each shift of the day, hospital management is enabled to choose the optimal number of nurses to meet actual requirements according to a desired service level and personnel saturation by means of a tool that simulates the patient flow in a medical unit based on automatic data retrieval from hospital databases. The validation and verification of the proposal were undertaken in a stroke unit."
Simulation and dissimulation of madness in the 19th century asylum,EVOLUTION PSYCHIATRIQUE,"Objectives. - This study explores two borderline forms of alienation simulation and dissimulation of insanity in the asylums of the 19th century. The issues raised are related to their historical setting, where the alienist profession was forming and entering into debate with the legal sphere. At the start of the 19th century, magistrates were disputing the authority of medical experts to assess penal responsibility. In the second half of the 19th century, the debate revolved around the issue of arbitrary internment, casting doubt on both the methods and the expert knowledge of alienists. Methods. - This study is based on an analysis of textual sources devoted directly or indirectly to alienist science and legal expertise in the second half of the 19th century. Some are polemic articles evidencing the tensions between the two professions. Numerous medical authors published writings, in particular in Delasiauve's Journal de Medecine Mentale, which was an essential vehicle in the debate for some ten years. Results. - The study of borderline or peripheral forms of mental illness led alienists to consolidate their diagnostic criteria, and also to seek to convince their partners in the public authorities. There was a need to proclaim specific knowledge making it possible to assess whether or not there was alienation, on the basis of common criteria. They concluded that simulated madness was not genuine madness, either because the simulator confuses madness and stupidity, or because the simulator invents an atypical behaviour that does not resemble any mental illness. Following on from Pinel's partial delirium and Esquirol's monomania, lucid madness according to Ulysse Treat refers to a type of alienated subject in whom delirium coexists with preserved reasoning faculties. This debate shows how nosography can constitute a response to social accusations aimed at the alienist corporation by magistrates and journalists. Discussion. - It is the debate between two different conceptions of madness that was reappraised in the course of this controversy between legal and medical authorities the holistic conception of Maine de Biran, for whom no faculty of the alienated subject escapes alienation, and the partial conception propounded by Royer-Collard, where alienation is never total. Conclusion. - All madness is partial. It is on the basis of this axiom, which emerged at the time of the French Revolution, that the alienist science of the 19th century was constructed. This is the necessary condition for any treatment to be able to act. This preservation of reasoning faculties can also serve to deceive and alienists and magistrates alike learn this to their cost. But if madness can be simulated or dissimulated, it is because its codes can be parodied and reoriented. The semiology of mental illnesses is not that of bodily medicine, which bases its semiology on an anatomical, clinical lesion. Because the semiology is mental, it can only be vouched for by the Other. This aspect of the exercise of medicine in the area of mental illness requires alienists to obtain strong social consensus on their actions. Thus alienists have come to defend a conception of their profession that is based on both knowledge on the subject of alienation, and on know-how and life skills in dealing with alienated people.

Fielding incognito standardised patients as 'known' patients in a controlled trial in general practice,MEDICAL EDUCATION,"BACKGROUND Incognito standardised patients (SPs) have only been used to represent new patients so far. The few trials with incognito SPs provide little detail on the method used for fielding them. OBJECTIVE To establish the feasibility of introducing SPs as 'known' patients (i.e. patients who have previously Visited the practice) into practices, to indicate the required practice preparations, and to describe the Various aspects of using SPs in a pretest/post-test design. METHODS We used incognito SPs as known patients in a controlled trial to assess the practice behaviour of 49 trainees. The SPs received a 2-day training in role playing and completing checklists. We compiled comprehensive practice information folders of each practice to be Visited. Real personal data and faked medical data of SPs were inserted in the filing system of each practice to be Visited. Apart from SP roles with slightly different reasons-for-en counter and different SPs, the same training protocol, checklists and practice information folders were used in the post-test. RESULTS The SPs carried out 287 visits in 50 practices. All practices prepared the patient records for the SP visits in a fairly authentic practice style. Trainees detected the SP in 74 visits. The main reasons for detection were imperfections in patient records and aspects of SP roles or role playing. CONCLUSION Fielding incognito SP visits as known patients was feasible but labour-intensive. Preparing the SP patient records and familiarising SPs with the interior of practices represented new elements in the use of SPs. The pretest/post-test format made their use more efficient instead of complicating it."
Is There Bias against Simulation in Microsurgery Training?,JOURNAL OF RECONSTRUCTIVE MICROSURGERY,"Background While other:surgical specialties have embraced virtual reality-simulation for training and recertification, microsurgery has lagged.. This study aims to assess the opinions of microsurgeons on the role of simulation in microsurgery assessment and training. Methods We surveyed faculty members of the American Society of Reconstructive Microsurgery to ascertain Opinions on their use of simulation in training and opinions about the utility of simulation for skills acquisition, teaching, and skills assessment. The 21-question survey was disseminated online to 675 members. Results Eighty-nine members completed the survey for a 13.2% response rate. Few microsurgeons have experience with high-fidelity simulation, and opinions on its utility are internally inconsistent. Although 84% of respondents could not identify a reason why simulation would not be useful, only 24% believed simulation is a useful measure of clinical performance. Nearly three-fourths of respondents were skeptical that simulation would improve their skills. Ninety-four percent had no experience with Simulator-based assessment. Conclusion Simulation has been shown to improve skills acquisition in microsurgery, but our survey suggests that unfamiliarity may:foster bias against the technology. Failure to incorporate simulation may adversely affect training and may put surgeons at a disadvantage should these technologies be adopted for recertification by regulatory agencies."
The ABCs of DKA: Development and Validation of a Computer-Based Simulator and Scoring System,JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE,"Clinical management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) continues to be suboptimal; simulation-based training may bridge this gap and is particularly applicable to teaching DKA management skills given it enables learning of basic knowledge, as well as clinical reasoning and patient management skills. 1) To develop, test, and refine a computer-based simulator of DKA management; 2) to collect validity evidence, according to National Standard's validity framework; and 3) to judge whether the simulator scoring system is an appropriate measure of DKA management skills of undergraduate and postgraduate medical trainees. After developing the DKA simulator, we completed usability testing to optimize its functionality. We then conducted a preliminary validation of the scoring system for measuring trainees' DKA management skills. We recruited year 1 and year 3 medical students, year 2 postgraduate trainees, and endocrinologists (n = 75); each completed a simulator run, and we collected their simulator-computed scores. We collected validity evidence related to content, internal structure, relations with other variables, and consequences. Our simulator consists of six cases highlighting DKA management priorities. Real-time progression of each case includes interactive order entry, laboratory and clinical data, and individualised feedback. Usability assessment identified issues with clarity of system status, user control, efficiency of use, and error prevention. Regarding validity evidence, Cronbach's alpha was 0.795 for the seven subscales indicating favorable internal structure evidence. Participants' scores showed a significant effect of training level (p < 0.001). Scores also correlated with the number of DKA patients they reported treating, weeks on Medicine rotation, and comfort with managing DKA. A score on the simulation exercise of 75 % had a sensitivity and specificity of 94.7 % and 51.8%, respectively, for delineating between expert staff physicians and trainees. We demonstrate how a simulator and scoring system can be developed, tested, and refined to determine its quality for use as an assessment modality. Our evidence suggests that it can be used for formative assessment of trainees' DKA management skills."
Simulation experiences of paramedic students: a cross-cultural examination,ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND PRACTICE,"Background: Simulation-based education is an important part of paramedic education and training. While accessing clinical placements that are adequate in quality and quantity continues to be challenging, simulation is being recognized by paramedic academics as a potential alternative. Examining students' satisfaction of simulation, particularly cross-culturally is therefore important in providing feedback to academic teaching staff and the international paramedic community. Objective: This study aimed to compare simulation satisfaction among paramedic students from universities in Australia and Jordan. Methods: A cross-sectional study using a paper-based English version of the Satisfaction with Simulation Experience Scale was administered to paramedic students from all year levels. Results: A total of 511 students participated in this study; 306 students (60%) from Australia (Monash University) and 205 students (40%) from Jordan (Jordan University of Science and Technology). There were statistically significant differences with large effect size noted in all three original factors between Australian and Jordanian students: debrief and feedback (mean = 38.66 vs mean = 34.15; P<0.001; d=0.86), clinical reasoning (mean = 21.32 vs mean = 18.28; P<0.001; d=0.90), and clinical learning (mean = 17.59 vs mean = 15.47; P<0.001; d=1.12). Conclusion: This study has demonstrated that simulation education is generally well received by students in Australia and Jordan although Australian students reported having higher satisfaction levels then their Jordanian counterparts. These results provide important data for paramedic educators involved in simulation-based education and training in Australia and Jordan and pave the way for other cross-cultural examinations to be explored."
Cognitive processing differences of experts and novices when correlating anatomy and cross-sectional imaging,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING,"The ability to correlate anatomical knowledge and medical imaging is crucial to radiology and as such, should be a critical component of medical education. However, we are hindered in our ability to teach this skill because we know very little about what expert practice looks like, and even less about novices' understanding. Using a unique simulation tool, this research conducted cognitive clinical interviews with experts and novices to explore differences in how they engage in this correlation and the underlying cognitive processes involved in doing so. This research supported what has been known in the literature, that experts are significantly faster at making decisions on medical imaging than novices. It also offers insight into the spatial ability and reasoning that is involved in the correlation of anatomy to medical imaging. There are differences in the cognitive processing of experts and novices with respect to meaningful patterns, organized content knowledge, and the flexibility of retrieval. Presented are some novice-expert similarities and differences in image processing. This study investigated extremes, opening an opportunity to investigate the sequential knowledge acquisition from student to resident to expert, and where educators can help intervene in this learning process.

A High-Immersive Medical Training Platform Using Direct lntraoperative Data,IEEE ACCESS,"The virtual training of primitive surgical procedures has been widely recognized as immersive and effective to medical education. Virtual basic surgical training framework integrated with multi-sensations rendering has been recognized as one of the most immersive implementations in medical education. Yet, compared with the original intraoperative data, there has always been an argument on the lower fidelity these data are represented in virtual surgical training. In this paper, a solution is proposed to achieve better training immersion by incorporating multiple higher-fidelity factors toward a trainee's sensations (vision, touch, and hearing) during virtual training sessions. This was based on the proposal of a three-tier model to classify reasons leading to fidelity issues. This include: haptic factors, such as high-quality fitting of force models based on surgical data acquisition, the use of actual surgical instrument linked to desktop haptic devices; visual factors, such as patient-specific CT images segmentation and reconstruction from the original medical data; and hearing factors, such as variations of the sound of monitoring systems in the theatre under different surgical conditions. Twenty seven urologists comprising 18 novices and 9 professors were invited to test a virtual training system based on the proposed solution. Post-test values from both professors' and novices' groups demonstrated obvious improvements in comparison with pre-test values under both the subjective and objective criteria, the fitting rate of the whole puncture processing is 99.93%. Both the subjective and objective results demonstrated a higher performance than the existing benchmark training platform. Combining these in a systematic approach, tuned with specific fidelity requirements, haptically enabled training simulation systems would be able to provide a more immersive and effective training environment."
A new approach to multi-professional end of life care training using a sequential simulation (SqS Simulation (TM)) design: A mixed methods study,NURSE EDUCATION TODAY,"Background: A need for improved education and training for hospital staff caring for patients in the last year of life was identified at an urban UK hospital. Sequential Simulation (SqS Simulation (TM)) is a type of simulation that recreates a patient's journey, considering the longitudinal element of care and how this might impact on the patient's experiences, wishes and needs. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate a new end of life care training intervention for multi-professional hospital staff, and its effect on their confidence in managing patients at the end of their life. Setting/Participants: Based on the results of a formal Training Needs Analysis, four SqS Simulation (TM) specialty based courses were designed for general medical and surgical multidisciplinary teams in an acute UK hospital. Methods: Over three months, seven SqS Simulation (TM) sessions were attended by fifty-seven multidisciplinary healthcare professionals. A quasi-experimental mixed-methods study was conducted using open and closed ended questionnaires, pre and post-intervention. Changes in course attendees' confidence levels were analysed and qualitative data from free-text answers informed potential reasons for any differences identified. Results: Confidence improved for all professional cohorts (p < 0.001). The differences were found to be highly significant for 'doctors' (p < 0.001), significant for 'therapists' (p = 0.02) and not significant for the 'nurses' cohort (p = 0.238). This was explored further using a qualitative explanatory framework. Categories included: Communicating with Families; Teamwork; Goal Planning; Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation; Course Usefulness; Prior Training; and Clinical Experience. Conclusion: This study has shown an overall improvement in confidence across disciplines after attending a SqS Simulation (TM) course. The differences in quantitative results between disciplines were explored through the qualitative data and revealed a difference in what the professionals gained from it. Further studies are required to assess its effectiveness in maintaining confidence of end of life care in practice, as well as its benefit to patient outcomes."
Simulation can offer a sustainable contribution to clinical education in osteopathy,CHIROPRACTIC & MANUAL THERAPIES,"BackgroundClinical education forms a substantial component of health professional education. Increased cohorts in Australian osteopathic education have led to consideration of alternatives to traditional placements to ensure adequate clinical exposure and learning opportunities. Simulated learning offers a new avenue for sustainable clinical education. The aim of the study was to explore whether directed observation of simulated scenarios, as part replacement of clinical hours, could provide an equivalent learning experience as measured by performance in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE).MethodsThe year 3 osteopathy cohort were invited to participate in replacement of 50% of their clinical placement hours with online facilitated, video-based simulation exercises (intervention). Competency was assessed by an OSCE at the end of the teaching period. Inferential statistics were used to explore any differences between the control and intervention groups as a post-test control design.ResultsThe funding model allowed ten learners to participate in the intervention, with sixty-six in the control group. Only one OSCE item was significantly different between groups, that being technique selection (p=0.038, d=0.72) in favour of the intervention group, although this may be a type 1 error. Grade point average was moderately positively correlated with the manual therapy technique station total score (r=0.35, p<0.01) and a trivial relationship with the treatment reasoning station total score (r=0.17, p=0.132).ConclusionsThe current study provides support for further investigation into part replacement of clinical placements with directed observation of simulated scenarios in osteopathy."
Conceptualising and classifying validity evidence for simulation,MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Context The term 'validity' is used pervasively in medical education, especially as it relates to curriculum, assessment, measurement and instrumentation. Exactly what is meant by the term 'validity' in the medical education literature is not always clearly defined. Objectives This study attempts to clarify, conceptualise and classify how validity fits within the context of assessment and to provide a framework for medical educators to determine the type and degree of validity evidence required for their specific assessment and evaluation needs. Methods We apply a structure for considering validity, and its association with validation, in medical education. We build this discussion around the use of simulation in medical training because of its rapid growth as a foundation for numeric measurement of performance in the development of clinical skills and reasoning. We explain why validity is inextricably tied to the assessment process in both simulation-based medical training and traditional medical education. Results This logical framework structures the type and degree of validity evidence for various assessment and evaluation needs. We also provide an example for medical educators to reference and follow in collecting and reviewing their own needs for validity evidence in all aspects of medical education. Conclusions Assessment is integral to measurement and decision making in medical education. The implications of assessment results are variably dependent on the inferences and decisions made from them. As such, validity evidence is critical, but is also flexibly tied to those decisions and not all assessments require the same degree of validity rigor. The framework described herein reinforces a model for medical educators to use in developing their assessment and evaluation needs and associated requirements for validity evidence."
Are United States Medical Licensing Exam Step 1 and 2 Scores Valid Measures for Postgraduate Medical Residency Selection Decisions?,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,"Purpose United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) scores are frequently used by residency program directors when evaluating applicants. The objectives of this report are to study the chain of reasoning and evidence that underlies the use of USMLE Step 1 and 2 scores for postgraduate medical resident selection decisions and to evaluate the validity argument about the utility of USMLE scores for this purpose. Method This is a research synthesis using the critical review approach. The study first describes the chain of reasoning that underlies a validity argument about using test scores for a specific purpose. It continues by summarizing correlations of USMLE Step 1 and 2 scores and reliable measures of clinical skill acquisition drawn from nine studies involving 393 medical learners from 2005 to 2010. The integrity of the validity argument about using USMLE Step 1 and 2 scores for postgraduate residency selection decisions is tested. Results The research synthesis shows that USMLE Step 1 and 2 scores are not correlated with reliable measures of medical students', residents', and fellows' clinical skill acquisition. Conclusions The validity argument about using USMLE Step 1 and 2 scores for postgraduate residency selection decisions is neither structured, coherent, nor evidence based. The USMLE score validity argument breaks down on grounds of extrapolation and decision/interpretation because the scores are not associated with measures of clinical skill acquisition among advanced medical students, residents, and subspecialty fellows. Continued use of USMLE Step 1 and 2 scores for postgraduate medical residency selection decisions is discouraged."
Exploring the reason for increased activity of SHP2 caused by D61Y mutation through molecular dynamics,COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,"Juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia, an aggressive myeloproliferative neoplasm, is characterized by thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, fever and excess myelomonocytic cells. Approximately 35% of patients with JMML occur D61Y mutation in PTPN11, and it increases the activity of the protein. However, the effect of the D61Y mutation on SHP2 conformations in molecular basis is poorly understood. Therefore, the molecular dynamics simulations on SHP2-D61Y and SHP2-WT were performed to explore the effect of D61Y mutation on SHP2 and explain the reason for high activity of SHP2-D61Y mutant. The study on the RMSF, per-residue RMSD, PCA, DCCM and secondary structure found that the flexibilities of regions (residues His458-Ser460 and Gln506-Ala509) in SHP2-D61Y were higher than the corresponding regions in SHP2-WT, and the conformations of these regions almost transformed from alpha-helix and beta-strand to Turn, respectively. Thus, the catalytical sites in the PIP domain (residues Asn217-Thr524) were exposed to the substrate easily, which contributed to the enhancement of SHP2-D61Y activity. Moreover, the residue interaction network, H bond occupancy and binding free energy were calculated, revealing that conformational difference were caused by distinctions in residue-residue interactions between Asp/Tyr61-Gln506, Gln506-Gln510, Gln506-Phe251, Gln506-G1y60, Gln506-Tyr63, Asp/Tyr61-Cys459, Cys459-11e463 and Cys459-Arg465. The study here may offer the valuable information to explore the reason for the increased activity of SHP2 after D61Y-mutation."
A System Ergonomic Analysis Approach for Potential Critical Incidents in Medical Treatment Processes,4TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"The necessity for safe treatment processes in clinical work systems is obvious. In recent years an increasing number of Clinical Incident Reporting Systems (CIRS) has been established in hospitals worldwide in order to monitor and report critical incidents and to improve the underlying treatment processes. However, CIRS are always restricted to the identification of critical incidents, which have lately occurred, whereas only a systematic analysis of clinical workflows can identify also potential critical incidents of the future. For this reason we have developed a system ergonomic analysis approach for potential critical incidents in medical treatment processes based on a realistic simulation of clinical work processes in combination with their video documentation and expert interviews. The set-up of the simulation is performed directly with the help of the involved medical staff and within their very own clinical environment. The video documentation of the simulated clinical work processes then guarantees a systematic foundation for the later process analysis and optimization based on structured interviews of all system experts involved (physicians, nurses, technicians etc.) and a system ergonomic MTO concept aiming at a well balanced design of all system elements (Men, Technology & Organization). Using this system ergonomic approach in cooperation with the Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care at the Klinikum Ernst von Bergmann in Potsdam (Germany) for the analysis of the inner clinical transfer of ICU patients resulted not only in a significant amount of critical incidents, which have lately occurred, but also a wide variety of potential critical incidents likely to happen in the future."
AN ORAL PRACTICAL EXAMINATION IN EMERGENCY CLINICAL SURGERY,MEDICAL EDUCATION,"A body of students were asked about their views regarding an oral practical examination in clinical surgery that had been in practice for over 12 years. This is an examination with the planned objective to test problem-solving abilities and professional attitudes in emergency surgery. Verbal emergency simulation aided by appropriate pathological specimens, surgical instruments and X-rays are put forward by the examiners, and the candidate is asked to respond. One hundred and ninety-four students returned their questionnaire out of a total of 196 students (99% response rate). Candidates who were satisfied with their answers in the examination numbered 127 (65%), while 67 candidates were dissatisfied (35%). Reasons for dissatisfaction were cited as difficult and complex emergency simulation questions, expressed by 44 candidates (23%), and anxiety generated by confrontation of the examiners, expressed by 23 candidates (12%). One hundred and thirteen students (58%) thought a change in the format of the examination was not needed, while 47 students (24%) suggested a change mostly towards standardization of the examination. Emergency clinical surgery is an important area of the surgical curriculum that needs to be assessed properly. A more standardized version of this oral practical examination could perhaps provide a useful tool of assessment."
Utility of Simulation as a Teaching Tool for Nursing Staff Involved with Code Blue Management,INDIAN JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE,"Background: The responsibility of nurses is early clinical deterioration and taking appropriate action. Knowledge and proficiency in Code Blue protocols come handy, which lacks in most nurses recognising. Simulation-based learning plays a role in improving performance and confidence in handling such situations. This goal-based method of program evaluation aims to examine Code Blue training programs and compare them with current literature and established professional standards while assessing participants' experience and change in knowledge to this educational method. Methods: Following ethical approval, a prospective interventional study was conducted in the simulation center of a private medical college in Mangalore on 65 nursing students. A pretest was given to the participants on the day of the session to assess their baseline understanding followed by prebriefing, all previously having received didactic lectures on Code Blue protocol, crash cart, and cardiac arrest algorithms.They were divided into three batches and each batch performed on crash cart and cardiac arrest stations using an electrocardiogram simulator. A simulated drill was enacted by the faculty on managing a Code Blue event and a discussion was followed. Nurses underwent two simulated scenarios, shockable and nonshockable cardiac arrest algorithms, followed by debriefing. Posttest and feedback form was asked to be filled. Results: A significant increase in mean% from pretest to posttest (55.69-7733%) following simulated drills. Conclusions: The use of simulation to train nurses in Code Blue scenarios records greater satisfaction and improvement in clinical reasoning, knowledge, and skills. Hence, the incorporation of simulation teaching in training of those involved in caring for high-risk patients is the need of the hour."
Simulation-based Assessment and Retraining for the Anesthesiologist Seeking Reentry to Clinical Practice: A Case Series,ANESTHESIOLOGY,"Background: Established models for assessment and maintenance of competency in anesthesiology may not be adequate for anesthesiologists wishing to reenter practice. The authors describe a program developed in their institution incorporating simulator-based education, to help determine competency in licensed and previously licensed anesthesiologists before return to practice. Methods: The authors have used simulation for assessment and retraining at their institution since 2002. Physicians evaluated by the authors' center undergo an adaptable 2-day simulation-based assessment conducted by two board-certified anesthesiologists. A minimum of three cases are presented on each day, with specific core competencies assessed, and participants complete a standard Clinical Anesthesia Year 3 level anesthesia knowledge test. Participants are debriefed extensively and retraining regimens are designed, where indicated, consisting of a combination of simulation and operating-room observership. Results: Twenty anesthesiologists were referred to the authors' institution between 2002 and 2012. Fourteen participants (70%) were in active clinical practice 1 yr after participation in the authors' program, five (25%) were in supervised positions, and nine (45%) had resumed independent clinical practice. The reasons of participants not in practice were personal (1 participant) and medico-legal (3 participants); two participants were lost to follow-up. Two of 14 physicians, who were formally assessed in the authors' program, were deemed likely unfit for safe return to practice, irrespective of further training. These physicians were unavailable for contact 1 yr after assessment. Conclusion: Anesthesiologists seeking to return to active clinical status are a heterogeneous group. The simulated environment provides an effective means by which to assess baseline competency and also a way to retrain physicians."
Real-world virtual patient simulation to improve diagnostic performance through deliberate practice: a prospective quasi-experimental study,DIAGNOSIS,"Objectives: Diagnostic errors are pervasive in medicine and most often caused by clinical reasoning failures. Clinical presentations characterized by nonspecific symptoms with broad differential diagnoses (e.g., dizziness) are especially prone to such errors. Methods: We hypothesized that novice clinicians could achieve proficiency diagnosing dizziness by training with virtual patients (VPs). This was a prospective, quasi experimental, pretest-posttest study (2019) at a single academic medical center. Internal medicine interns (intervention group) were compared to second/third year residents (control group). A case library of VPs with dizziness was developed from a clinical trial (AVERTNCT02483429). The approach (VIPER - Virtual Interactive Practice to build Expertise using Real cases) consisted of brief lectures combined with 9 h of supervised deliberate practice. Residents were provided dizziness-related reading and teaching modules. Both groups completed pretests and posttests. Results: For interns (n=22) vs. residents (n=18), pretest median diagnostic accuracy did not differ (33% [IQR 18-46] vs. 31% [IQR 13-50], p=0.61) between groups, while posttest accuracy did (50% [IQR 42-67] vs. 20% [IQR 17-33], p=0.001). Pretest median appropriate imaging did not differ (33% [IQR 17-38] vs. 31% [IQR 13-38], p=0.89) between groups, while posttest appropriateness did (65% [IQR 52-74] vs. 25% [IQR 17-36], p<0.001). Conclusions: Just 9 h of deliberate practice increased diagnostic skills (both accuracy and testing appropriateness) of medicine interns evaluating real-world dizziness 'in silico' more than similar to 1.7 years of residency training. Applying condensed educational experiences such as VI-PER across a broad range of common presentations could significantly enhance diagnostic education and translate to improved patient care."
A Hybrid Bottom-Up and Top-Down Approach to Machine Medical Ethics: Theory and Data,MACHINE MEDICAL ETHICS,"The perceived weaknesses of philosophical normative theories as machine ethic candidates have led some philosophers to consider combining them into some kind of a hybrid theory. This chapter develops a philosophical machine ethic which integrates top-down normative theories (rule-utilitarianism and prima-facie deontological ethics) and  bottom-up (case-based reasoning) computational structure. This hybrid ethic is tested in a medical machine whose input-output function is treated as a simulacrum of professional human ethical action in clinical medicine. In six clinical medical simulations run on the proposed hybrid ethic, the output of the machine matched the respective acts of human medical professionals. Thus, the proposed machine ethic emerges as a successful model of medical ethics, and a platform for further developments."
Evaluation of resident satisfaction and change in knowledge following use of high-fidelity simulation teaching for anaesthesia residents,INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA,"Background and Aims: Anaesthesia practice demands medical knowledge and skills as essential components for patient management in peri-operative emergencies. Since all residents are not exposed to such situations during their residency, training them using simulation technology could bridge this knowledge and skill gap. The aim of this study was to train and evaluate residents to manage anaesthesia emergencies on high fidelity simulators. Methods: Kirkpatrick model of program evaluation was carried out. Resident reaction was captured using a satisfaction questionnaire and the change in knowledge was assessed using pre-test and post-test Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs). Six scenarios were created and executed on a human patient simulator (HPS). All 22 residents participated in this teaching learning method. The steps of simulation teaching included pre-test, pre-briefing, orientation to manikins, performing/scribe, debriefing, feedback questionnaire, and post-test. The satisfaction questionnaire was administered following the second and fourth scenario. Results: 95% residents agreed on overall satisfaction, that it helps in building team dynamics and clinical reasoning. All students agreed that this teaching had positive professional impact. 14% residents felt they were anxious during the class. The items in the questionnaire had a Cronbach's a value of 0.9. The mean score for pre-test was 24.22 +/- 7 (Mean t SD) and the post-test was 47.18 +/- 5.6, the difference between the scores were statistically significant (P = 0.007). Conclusion: The use of high-fidelity simulation to train anaesthesia residents resulted in greater satisfaction scores and improved the residents' reasoning skills."
The minimal relationship between simulation fidelity and transfer of learning,MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Medical Education 2012 Context High-fidelity simulators have enjoyed increasing popularity despite costs that may approach six figures. This is justified on the basis that simulators have been shown to result in large learning gains that may transfer to actual patient care situations. However, most commonly, learning from a simulator is compared with learning in a no-intervention control group. This fails to clarify the relationship between simulator fidelity and learning, and whether comparable gains might be achieved at substantially lower cost. Objectives This analysis was conducted to review studies that compare learning from high-fidelity simulation (HFS) with learning from low-fidelity simulation (LFS) based on measures of clinical performance. Methods Using a variety of search strategies, a total of 24 studies contrasting HFS and LFS and including some measure of performance were located. These studies referred to learning in three areas: auscultation skills; surgical techniques, and complex management skills such as cardiac resuscitation. Results Both HFS and LFS learning resulted in consistent improvements in performance in comparisons with no-intervention control groups. However, nearly all the studies showed no significant advantage of HFS over LFS, with average differences ranging from 1% to 2%. Discussion The factors influencing learning, and the reasons for this surprising finding, are discussed."
Leveraging the Learning Process in Health through Clinical Cases Simulator,2013 IEEE 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SERIOUS GAMES AND APPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH (SEGAH),"This paper presents a multi-agent learning system for health care practitioners named SimDeCS (Simulation for Decision Making in the Health Care Service). The main contribution of this work is the system architecture, model-learning environment supported by artificial intelligence techniques, and its evaluation as a educational software. The SimDeCS was designed as a multi-agent system, composed by three intelligent agents: Domain Agent, Learning Agent and Mediator Agent. The Domain Agent implements the knowledge model by probabilistic reasoning (Bayesian networks), with the knowledge encoded by human experts. The pedagogical strategies emerge from an influence diagram, based on the student's conduct during the simulation. Some results related with the SimDeCs evaluation are presented."
Glycemic control in adolescents with type 1 diabetes: Are computerized simulations effective learning tools?,PEDIATRIC DIABETES,"Objective Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in adolescent patients is often characterized by poor glycemic control. This study aimed at exploring the contribution of learning with computerized simulations to support: (a) mechanistic understanding of the biochemical processes related to diabetes; (b) diabetes self-management knowledge; and (c) glycemic control. We hypothesized that learning with such simulations might support adolescents in gaining a better understanding of the biochemical processes related to glucose regulation, and consequently improve their glycemic control. Methods A prospective case-control study was conducted in 12- to 18-year-old adolescents with T1DM (n = 85) who were routinely treated at an outpatient diabetes clinic. While the control group (n = 45) received the routine face-to-face follow-up, the intervention group (n = 40) learned in addition with computerized simulations that were embedded in pedagogically supportive activities. Participants in both groups completed a set of questionnaires regarding sociodemographic characteristics, diabetes mechanistic reasoning and diabetes self-management. Clinical data and serum glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were gathered from medical records. All the data was collected at recruitment and 3 months later. Results Analysis revealed improvement HbA1c levels in the intervention group (8.7% +/- 1.7%) vs the controls (9.6% +/- 1.6%) after 3 months (P < .05). Regression analysis showed that levels of diabetes mechanistic understanding and diabetes self-management knowledge, in addition to sociodemographic parameters, accounted for 31% of the HbA1c variance (P < .001). Conclusion These results suggest that learning with computerized simulations about biochemical processes can improve adolescents' adherence to medical recommendations and result in improved glycemic control. Implementing scientific learning into the hospital educational setting is discussed."
Web-Based Virtual Patients in Nursing Education: Development and Validation of Theory-Anchored Design and Activity Models,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,"Background: Research has shown that nursing students find it difficult to translate and apply their theoretical knowledge in a clinical context. Virtual patients (VPs) have been proposed as a learning activity that can support nursing students in their learning of scientific knowledge and help them integrate theory and practice. Although VPs are increasingly used in health care education, they still lack a systematic consistency that would allow their reuse outside of their original context. There is therefore a need to develop a model for the development and implementation of VPs in nursing education. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a virtual patient model optimized to the learning and assessment needs in nursing education. Methods: The process of modeling started by reviewing theoretical frameworks reported in the literature and used by practitioners when designing learning and assessment activities. The Outcome-Present State Test (OPT) model was chosen as the theoretical framework. The model was then, in an iterative manner, developed and optimized to the affordances of virtual patients. Content validation was performed with faculty both in terms of the relevance of the chosen theories but also its applicability in nursing education. The virtual patient nursing model was then instantiated in two VPs. The students' perceived usefulness of the VPs was investigated using a questionnaire. The result was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: A virtual patient Nursing Design Model (vpNDM) composed of three layers was developed. Layer 1 contains the patient story and ways of interacting with the data, Layer 2 includes aspects of the iterative process of clinical reasoning, and finally Layer 3 includes measurable outcomes. A virtual patient Nursing Activity Model (vpNAM) was also developed as a guide when creating VP-centric learning activities. The students perceived the global linear VPs as a relevant learning activity for the integration of theory and practice. Conclusions: Virtual patients that are adapted to the nursing paradigm can support nursing students' development of clinical reasoning skills. The proposed virtual patient nursing design and activity models will allow the systematic development of different types of virtual patients from a common model and thereby create opportunities for sharing pedagogical designs across technical solutions."
Linking Patient Care Ownership and Professional Identity Formation through Simulation,TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE,"Theory The link between ownership of patient care and professional identity formation (PIF) has not been formally established, yet PIF researchers frequently cite clinical experiences as powerful contributions to PIF.Hypothesis:Using clinical simulation, this study aimed to explore the relationship between patient care ownership and the cognitive processes involved in the creation of a professional identity.Methods:In 2018-2019, 189 third-year students participated in a simulation in which they were placed in the role of a physician treating a patient in respiratory distress. Data were collected from 12 focus groups (n = 84; 44% of the third-year class), each lasting 15-25 minute. Students were asked four questions designed to identify moments when they felt like a physician and experienced feelings of ownership. Each focus group was transcribed and analyzed for the presence of known elements that contribute to feelings of psychological ownership, and then inductively for how students related their feelings of ownership to their professional identity.Results:When students were asked to take ownership of their patient's care, they underwent a three-step process: (1) experiencing disorientation, (2) reconceptualizing roles and responsibilities, and (3) reorientation to professional goals. Patient care ownership was disorienting because it marked a departure from the clinical roles the students had previously experienced. While disoriented, students engaged in a process of reflection during which they asked themselves who they were, who they were becoming, and who they needed to become to effectively serve in the role of a physician. This process prompted students to realize the limitations of their clinical reasoning abilities and that the role of a physician requires new ways of thinking.Conclusions:This study advances a conceptual model of PIF that identifies patient care ownership as acatalystin developing a professional identity. Assuming responsibility for patients places students into an unfamiliar role, which opens a channel for students to access new perspectives in their development as physicians."
Information-gathering patterns associated with higher rates of diagnostic error,ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION,"Diagnostic errors are an important source of medical errors. Problematic information-gathering is a common cause of diagnostic errors among physicians and medical students. The objectives of this study were to (1) determine if medical students' information-gathering patterns formed clusters of similar strategies, and if so (2) to calculate the percentage of incorrect diagnoses in each cluster. A total of 141 2nd year medical students completed a computer case simulation. Each student's information-gathering pattern included the sequence of history, physical examination, and ancillary testing items chosen from a predefined list. We analyzed the patterns using an artificial neural network and compared percentages of incorrect diagnoses among clusters of information-gathering patterns. We input patterns into a 35 x 35 self organizing map. The network trained for 10,000 epochs. The number of students at each neuron formed a surface that was statistically smoothed into clusters. Each student was assigned to one cluster, the cluster that contributed the largest value to the smoothed function at the student's location in the grid. Seven clusters were identified. Percentage of incorrect diagnoses differed significantly among clusters (Range 0-42%, I (2) = 13.62, P = .034). Distance of each cluster from the worst performing cluster was used to rank clusters. This rank was compared to rank determined by percentage incorrect. We found a high positive correlation (Spearman Correlation = .893, P = .007). Clusters closest to the worst performing cluster had the highest percentages of incorrect diagnoses. Patterns of information-gathering were distinct and had different rates of diagnostic error."
A new strategy in nursing education: From hybrid simulation to clinical practice,NURSE EDUCATION TODAY,"Background: Various instructional environments are used in nurse education to develop students' psychomotor and communication skills, reduce their anxiety levels, and enhance their satisfaction. Objectives: To examine the effect of three different instructional environments on the development of the students' psychomotor and communication skills and their levels of anxiety and satisfaction. Design: A prospective study design was used. Methods: The study sample consisted of 60 nursing students. Before the implementation of the study, the students' cognitive skills and trait anxiety levels were evaluated. The students were divided into five groups and five nursing activities (Leopold's maneuvers, teaching breastfeeding, family planning education, teaching vulvar self-examination and teaching breast self-examination) were specified for each group. They implemented these nursing activities under the supervision of a faculty member in the nursing skills laboratory (NSL), standardized patient laboratory (SPL) and clinical practice environment (CPE) respectively. In each instructional environment, the students' psychomotor and communication skills, state anxiety levels and satisfactions were evaluated. Results: The median scores for psychomotor skills [NSL = 73.1;SPL = 81.5;CPE = 88.6] and communication skills [NSL = 64.9;SPL = 71.6;CPE = 79.0] were found to increase as the students went on practicing in a more complicated environment (p < 0.05). Similarly, it was determined that the students' anxiety levels decreased as they were practicing incrementally [NSL = 33.0;SPL = 32.0;CPE = 31.0]. As the instructional environments were getting more similar to the reality, the students' satisfaction levels were found to become higher. Conclusions: Students who deliberately practice in the instructional environments until they are competent develop their psychomotor skills while reducing their anxiety levels, and enhancing their communication skills and satisfaction, For that reason, the development of students' competency areas is thought to be effective for enhancement of patients and health care workers' safety.

Do nurses reason 'adaptively' in time limited situations: the findings of a descriptive regression analysis,BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING,"Background: Time pressure is common in acute healthcare and significantly influences clinical judgement and decision making. Despite nurses' judgements being studied since the 1960s, the empirical picture of how time pressure impacts on nurses' judgement strategies and outcomes remain undeveloped. This paper aims to assess alterations in nurses' judgement strategies and outcomes under time pressure in a simulated acute care setting. Methods: In a simulated acute care environment, ninety-seven nurses were exposed to 25 clinical scenarios under time pressured and no time pressured conditions. Scenarios were randomly sampled from a large dataset of patient cases. A reference standard (judgement correctness) was generated from the same patient case records. In 12 of the scenarios only 20 seconds per judgement was allowed, in the other 13 scenarios no time pressure existed. Percentage of correct judgments in both conditions was calculated. Logistic regression modelling (of 2,425 observations) described the relationship between information cues used and judgments made. The degree of attention paid to particular cues was captured by calculating cue relative weights. The clustering effect of nurses was countered by estimating robust standard errors. The Chow test was used to test the null hypothesis that differences in regression coefficients in time pressure and no time pressure models were zero. Results: Compared to no time pressure, no significant difference was observed in the proportion of correct judgments when nurses were put under time pressure. However, time pressure significantly impacted on the judgment strategies employed. Whilst nurses predominantly used respiration rate to make judgements, they used fewer cues to reach their clinical judgements under time pressure. The relative weighting afforded to heart rate was much smaller in the time pressure regression model, indicating that nurses paid significantly less attention to it when making judgements under time pressure. Conclusions: Time pressure had a significant effect on nurses' judgement strategies but not outcomes. Nurses tended to use less information to reach judgements under time pressure, but not at the expense of judgment accuracy. Findings imply that nurses are capable of using adaptive judgement strategies to cope with moderate time pressures when making clinical judgements in acute care."
The variability in how physicians think: a casebased diagnostic simulation exercise,DIAGNOSIS,"Objectives: Little is known about how physician diagnostic thinking unfolds over time when evaluating patients. We designed a case-based simulation to understand how physicians reason, create differential diagnoses, and employ strategies to achieve a correct diagnosis. Methods: Between June 2017 and August 2018, hospital medicine physicians at two academic medical centers were presented a standardized case of a patient presenting with chest pain who was ultimately diagnosed with herpes zoster using an interview format. Case information was presented in predetermined aliquots where participants were then asked to think-aloud, describing their thoughts and differential diagnoses given the data available. At the conclusion of the interview, participants were asked questions about their diagnostic process. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and content analysis was conducted to identify key themes related to the diagnostic thinking process. Results: Sixteen hospital medicine physicians (nine men, seven women) participated in interviews and four obtained the correct final diagnosis (one man, three women). Participants had an average of nine years of experience. Overall, substantial heterogeneity in both the differential diagnoses and clinical reasoning among participants was observed. Those achieving the correct diagnosis utilized systems-based or anatomic approaches when forming their initial differential diagnoses, rather than focusing on life-threatening diagnoses alone. Evidence of cognitive bias was common; those with the correct diagnosis more often applied debiasing strategies than those with the incorrect final diagnosis. Conclusions: Heterogeneity in diagnostic evaluation appears to be common and may indicate faulty data processing. Structured approaches and debiasing strategies appear helpful in promoting diagnostic accuracy."

Simulation of Abnormal Physiological Signals in a Phantom for Bioengineering Education,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONLINE AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,"In clinical practice and in particular in the diagnostic process, the assessment of cardiac and respiratory functions is supported by electrocardiogram and auscultation. These exams are non-invasive, quick and inexpensive to perform and easy to interpret. For these reasons, this type of assessment is a constant in the daily life of a clinician and the information obtained is central to the decision-making process. Therefore, it is essential that during their training, students of health-related subjects acquire skills in the acquisition and evaluation of the referred physiological signals. Simulation, considering the technological possibilities of today, is an excellent preparation tool since it exposes trainees to near real contexts but without the associated risks. Hence, the simulation of physiological signals plays an important role in the education of healthcare professionals, bioengineering professionals and also in the development and calibration of medical devices. This paper describes a project to develop synchronized electrocardiogram (ECG), phonocardiogram (PCG) and breathing sounds simulators that aims to improve an existing phantom simulator. The developed system allows, in an integrated way, to generate normal and pathological signals, being contemplated several distinct pathologies. For engineering education, it is also possible to simulate the introduction of signal disturbances or hardware malfunctions."
Simulation-based training in advanced airway skills in an otolaryngology residency program,LARYNGOSCOPE,"Objectives/Hypothesis: Life-support training emphasizes the primacy of airway management. Acquiring these skills requires practice and exposure to events. Otolaryngology residents lack standardized training in advanced airway skills. This project aimed to create such a program by using simulation-based methodology evaluated using specific educationally based tools. Study Design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: The program consisted of lectures and simulation-based training sessions designed to impart competency in a set of defined airway skills to otolaryngology residents. Only participating residents who completed the course (n = 12) were evaluated both before and after the course for their fund of knowledge through multiple-choice examinations and for clinical reasoning and technical skills as assessed by a panel of otolaryngologists in simulated difficult airway situations. Self-assessment tools were also incorporated. Results: The average multiple choice score was 12 of 27 (44%) before the course and 15 of 27 (55%) after the completion of the course (P = .001). Faculty assessment yielded a cumulative score of 80% and 91% pre- and postcourse, respectively (P = .002). Although all residents reported prior experience in a critical emergency airway situation, only one reported prior training in advanced airway skills. A significant increase in participants' self-perceived ability to carry out critical airway-related skills was observed. All respondents felt the course was effective. Conclusions: Simulation-based airway training courses can be effectively incorporated into existing educational curricula for otolaryngology residents, and their success can be measured using educationally based tools. With such a course, residents can be expected to demonstrate measurable improvement in clinical knowledge base, technical skills, and self-perceived ability to handle difficult airway situations.

Approaches to Teaching the Physical Exam to Preclerkship Medical Students: Results of a National Survey,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,"Purpose To assess current approaches to teaching the physical exam to preclerkship students at U.S. medical schools. Method The Directors of Clinical Skills Courses developed a 49-question survey addressing the approach, pedagogical methods, and assessment methods of preclerkship physical exam curricula. The survey was administered to all 141 Liaison Committee on Medical Education-accredited U.S. medical schools in October 2015. Results were aggregated across schools, and survey weights were used to adjust for response rate and school size. Results One hundred six medical schools (75%) responded. Seventy-nine percent of schools (84) began teaching the physical exam within the first two months of medical school. Fifty-six percent of schools (59) employed both a head-to-toe comprehensive approach and a clinical reasoning approach. Twenty-three percent (24) taught a portion of the physical exam interprofessionally. Videos, online modules, and simulators were used widely, and 39% of schools (41) used bedside ultrasonography. Schools reported a median of 4 formative assessments and 3 summative assessments, with 16% of schools (17) using criterion-based standard-setting methods for physical exam assessments. Results did not vary significantly by school size. Conclusions There was wide variation in how medical schools taught the physical exam to preclerkship students. Common pedagogical approaches included early initiation of physical exam instruction, use of technology, and methods that support clinical reasoning and competency-based medical education. Approaches used by a minority of schools included interprofessional education, ultrasound, and criterion-based standard-setting methods for assessments. Opportunities abound for research into the optimal methods for teaching the physical exam."
Development and inclusion of an entrustable professional activity (EPA) scale in a simulation-based medicine dispensing assessment,CURRENTS IN PHARMACY TEACHING AND LEARNING,"Background and purpose: Effective, safe, and patient-centred dispensing is a core task of community pharmacists. Entrustable professional activities (EPAs) offer a way of defining and assessing these daily practice activities. Although EPAs have become popular within competency-based medical education programs, their use is new to pharmacy education and assessment. Educational activity and setting: A simulation-based assessment framework containing a scale of entrustment was developed to evaluate the readiness of Year 4 undergraduate pharmacy students to safely manage the supply of prescribed medicine(s) in a community pharmacy. The assessment framework was piloted in a fourth year Transition to Practice course with 28 simulation-based assessments conducted. Findings: An entrustment framework was developed and implemented successfully with Year 4 undergraduate pharmacy students. The EPA for medicine dispensing integrates competency domains that include information gathering, providing patient-centred care, clinical reasoning, medicine dispensing, and professional communications. On a scale ranging from level 1 to level 5, the majority (73%) of entrustment ratings were level 2 or level 3; and of the students who achieved different ratings between clinical scenarios, 75% of students improved on their second simulation attempt. There was a strong correlation between the global EPA ratings with the total score achieved across the domains. Summary: Using simulation-based assessment, entrustment decision making can be incorporated in entry to profession undergraduate and postgraduate pharmacy courses to assess students' readiness to transition between learning and professional practice."
Medical Condition Monitoring System using Fuzzy Logic,PROCEEDINGS OF 2020 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS (ICAIIS),"Due to uncertainty and vagueness in the medical field, and day by day increase in the number of patients, an effective control system is needed to minimize practitioner uncertainty and vagueness and maximize its diagnostic solution. In order to better diagnose the disease, medical examinations are of greater importance to practitioners in identifying diseases and their stages. In this study, we proposed an efficient and robust system that can process different input values generated by different clinical tests and provide highly reliable outputs that must be used for medical diagnosis and decision making. For this reason, fuzzy logic is the best choice because it is very simple to design and implement and it is exceptionally efficient. The proposed system will use its medical test report data to process four different diseases that will be used as input to the system. The following are four medical diagnostic tests: 1. Blood pressure levels, 2. Diabetes, 3. Lipid distribution and 4. Liver function tests. MATLAB simulations are generated using MATLAB R2016b toolbox and implementation is done in Visual Studio 2015 using C# for the assumed values of clinical tests. The simulated results are almost identical with the designed model and the relative errors are in the acceptable range."
Discrete Event Simulation Model for the Analysis of Centralized Front Office Service in a Regional Hub Hospital,"WORLD CONGRESS ON MEDICAL PHYSICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING 2018, VOL 1","Today, hospital rankings are based primarily on basic clinical indicators. The aim of the project shown in this article is to develop a methodology able to improve non-clinical front office operation for the patients (like booking exams, delivering medical reports etc.), keeping the costs under control. The service center serves 600 users every day and it is the core of a great reorganization process, focused on centralization of office activities of the Careggi University Hospital of Florence, to ensure the best services to patients. For this reason, Discrete Event Simulation model (DES) have been used. The project of the model was made according to the real process observed during the confrontation with staff, document verification, field observation stage and study of data stored in hospital's databases. These researches provided parameters necessary for model running, such as number of accesses, service time, available resources and patient's waiting time. Validation confirmed that model is formally correct, and shown that waiting time of patients is substantially equal between real data and simulated outputs. The mean waiting time of all patients calculated by the model (7 min and 9 s) is only 2.6% lesser than real one (7 min and 20 s). Weekly workload of the model (3048 patients) is equal to reality, proving that the schedules of patient's accesses are correct. We used a statistic test to confirm the results. This paper shows that DES is a valuable tool that can be used to save money and improve clinical processes. In the future this model will be used to evaluate the reorganization of the Service Center with the aim to allow everyone (not only technical staff) to use it, through a web-based support, a predictive machine and a user interface."
Assessment of simulation and dissimulation in the MMPI-2 test profiles,RIVISTA DI PSICHIATRIA,"The aim of this study is to identify the criteria which would allow a differentiation between the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2) profiles, obtained from patients who present with problems of minimization of attitude (dissembling) who have shown a minimization of their problems; from patients who answered in a spontaneous and genuine fashion. Methods. Six hundred and fifty five MM PI profiles of outpatients of the Clinical Psychology Unit, University Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome. Patients were subdivided into two groups, based on the reason for attending: those who submitted voluntarily to a psychodiagnostic assessment and those who were assessed by request of an outside authority, e.g., in the case of those whose driving license was suspended. It has hypothesized that the latter group would not present with problems which would preclude obtaining the benefits required. The variables analyzed were the clinical scale and the validity scale MMPI-2, index F-K and the Ds scale of Gough. On the basis of the values of the F-K index and Ds scale, the patients were reclassified into three simulation categories: spontaneous registration; defended and doubtful's. Results. All indexes, validity scales and clinical scales of the standard profile were found to have significant differences between the dissimulation and normal groups. Sensibility and specificity of profile classification was according to both indexes 76%. Conclusions. Current evidence indicates that simulation of pathology is identifiable in MMPI-2 profiles. Our data demonstrate that it is possible to identify case of defensive minimization. These results confirm the hypothesis that simulation is a dimensional characteristic of MMPI which can reach extreme values in both ways: worsening of slight problems or suppression of existing problems."
Using the Virtual World of Second Life in Veterinary Medicine: Student and Faculty Perceptions,JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Virtual worlds are emerging technologies that can enhance student learning by encouraging active participation through simulation in immersive environments. At Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine (RUSVM), the virtual world of Second Life was piloted as an educational platform for first-semester students to practice clinical reasoning in a simulated veterinary clinical setting. Under the supervision of one facilitator, four groups of nine students met three times to process a clinical case using Second Life. In addition, three groups of four clinical faculty observed one Second Life meeting. Questionnaires using a 4-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 4 = strongly agree) and open-ended questions were used to assess student and clinical faculty perceptions of the Second Life platform. Perception scores of students (M = 2.7, SD = 0.7) and clinical faculty (M = 2.7, SD = 0.5) indicate that Second Life provides authentic and realistic learning experiences. In fact, students (M = 3.4, SD = 0.6) and clinical faculty (M = 2.9, SD = 1.0) indicate that Second Life should be offered to future students. Moreover, content analyses of open-ended responses from students and faculty support the use of Second Life based on reported advantages indicating that Second Life offers a novel and effective instructional method. Ultimately, results indicate that students and clinical faculty had positive educational experiences using Second Life, suggesting the need for further investigation into its application within the curriculum."
An example of simulation for a better understanding of PK/PD relationship of antibiotics,PATHOLOGIE BIOLOGIE,"The interpretation of PK/PD indices is specific to each class of antibiotics. In order to illustrate this, we developed a multidisciplinary tutorial program based on simulation of clinical cases. Three drugs were included in this software: tobramycin, vancomycin and azithromycin. From the dosage regimen proposed by the user, the model simulates a plotting of antibiotic plasma concentrations vs. time (tobramycin, vancomycin and azithromycin) and tissue concentrations (azithromycin). Peak and trough concentrations are calculated at steady-state. A commentary is provided to evaluate the efficacy of treatment and to assist the user in improving his prescription of tobramycin or vancomycin. T (> MIC) (time the concentration remains above the MIC) and AUC(24) (area under the concentration-time curve) are calculated in plasma and tissues for azithromycin. In order to create a link between theoretical pharmacokinetics and clinical practice, we propose this model as a simulation of antibiotic monitoring. We put the emphasis on interactivity and simulation, leading to applied reasoning and decision making. It illustrates (i) the influence of pharmacokinetic parameters, location of infection and bactericidal kinetics on the use of three different classes of antibiotics, (ii) the role of route of administration, dosing and intervals between administrations on therapeutic response and (iii) the influence of erratic administrations on clinical efficacy.

A 3D digitization system for conventional radiation therapy simulation,JOURNAL OF APPLIED CLINICAL MEDICAL PHYSICS,"While the majority of patients receiving external beam radiation therapy treatment are planned by CT simulation, a significant number of them are still planned using conventional simulators for various reasons. The information- collection process in a conventional simulation is often fragmented and done with primitive tools. For example, in many institutions body contours are still acquired using solder wires and tracing paper, a time- consuming and error- prone procedure. We have developed a 3D digitization system to assist the information- acquisition process at conventional simulations. The system consists of an infrared camera assembly, a wireless digitizer probe, and Windows- based software. The system can provide 3D coordinates of any points in space accessible by the probe with submillimeter accuracy. It can be used to capture body contours, to record the coordinates of portal points, and to take various measurements for dose calculations as well as for patient setup. The software can display all the captured data together with the planned treatment fields, providing a comprehensive geometric verification of the treatment configuration. The system can also transfer all the information to dose-planning programs in DICOM- RT format, providing an integrated information flow from simulation to dose planning."
"Coping with complex medical emergency situations. Competent and successful decision-making, communication and leadership",ANAESTHESIST,Stress is an integral part of the daily routine among healthcare workers in anesthesiology and emergency medicine. This article describes negative stress effects in complex emergency situations and presents helpful tools for coping with them. Evaluation and discussion of selected medical and psychological publications and the inclusion of expert opinions are presented. Negative stress of healthcare providers in medical emergencies severely affects their reasoning and communication and is inadequately taken into account during routine care. Research in aviation and psychology has provided various tools to improve performance during stressful events and should be taken into consideration for routine daily use.
Using imprecise probabilities to address the questions of inference and decision in randomized clinical trials,JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE,"Randomized controlled clinical trials play an important role in the development of new medical therapies. There is, however, an ethical issue surrounding the use of randomized treatment allocation when the patient is suffering from a life threatening condition and requires immediate treatment. Such patients can only benefit from the treatment they actually receive and not from the alternative therapy, even if it ultimately proves to be superior. We discuss a novel new way to analyse data from such clinical trials based on the use of the recently developed theory of imprecise probabilities. This work draws an explicit distinction between the related but nevertheless distinct questions of inference and decision in clinical trials. The traditional question of scientific interest asks 'Which treatment offers the greater chance of success?' and is the primary reason for conducting the clinical trial. The question of decision concerns the welfare of the patients in the clinical trial, asking whether the accumulated evidence favours one treatment over the other to such an extent that the next patient should decline randomization and instead express a preference for one treatment. Consideration of the decision question within the framework of imprecise probabilities leads to a mathematical definition of equipoise and a method for governing the randomization protocol of a clinical trial. This paper describes in detail the protocol for the conduct of clinical trials based on this new method of analysis, which is illustrated in a retrospective analysis of data from a clinical trial comparing the anti-emetic drugs ondansetron and droperidol in the treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting. The proposed methodology is compared quantitatively using computer simulation studies with conventional clinical trial designs and is shown to maintain high statistical power with reduced sample sizes, at the expense of a high type I error rate that we argue is irrelevant in some specific circumstances. Particular emphasis is placed on describing the type of medical conditions and treatment comparisons where the new methodology is expected to provide the greatest benefit."
Is simulation training effective in increasing podiatrists' confidence in foot ulcer management?,JOURNAL OF FOOT AND ANKLE RESEARCH,"Background: Foot ulcers are a frequent reason for diabetes-related hospitalisation. Clinical training is known to have a beneficial impact on foot ulcer outcomes. Clinical training using simulation techniques has rarely been used in the management of diabetes-related foot complications or chronic wounds. Simulation can be defined as a device or environment that attempts to replicate the real world. The few non-web-based foot-related simulation courses have focused solely on training for a single skill or part task (for example, practicing ingrown toenail procedures on models). This pilot study aimed to primarily investigate the effect of a training program using multiple methods of simulation on participants' clinical confidence in the management of foot ulcers. Methods: Sixteen podiatrists participated in a two-day Foot Ulcer Simulation Training (FUST) course. The course included pre-requisite web-based learning modules, practicing individual foot ulcer management part tasks (for example, debriding a model foot ulcer), and participating in replicated clinical consultation scenarios (for example, treating a standardised patient (actor) with a model foot ulcer). The primary outcome measure of the course was participants' pre- and post completion of confidence surveys, using a five-point Likert scale (1 = Unacceptable-5 = Proficient). Participants' knowledge, satisfaction and their perception of the relevance and fidelity (realism) of a range of course elements were also investigated. Parametric statistics were used to analyse the data. Pearson's r was used for correlation, ANOVA for testing the differences between groups, and a paired-sample t-test to determine the significance between pre- and post-workshop scores. A minimum significance level of p < 0.05 was used. Results: An overall 42% improvement in clinical confidence was observed following completion of FUST (mean scores 3.10 compared to 4.40, p < 0.05). The lack of an overall significant change in knowledge scores reflected the participant populations' high baseline knowledge and pre-requisite completion of web-based modules. Satisfaction, relevance and fidelity of all course elements were rated highly. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests simulation training programs can improve participants' clinical confidence in the management of foot ulcers. The approach has the potential to enhance clinical training in diabetes-related foot complications and chronic wounds in general."
Teaching for reducing diagnostic errors,INDIAN PEDIATRICS,"Diagnostic errors, constituted by a missed, wrong, or delayed diagnosis detected later by additional tests or findings, are one of the most vexing issues in medicine. They are one of the commonest causes of patient-harm and also medical negligence claims. Although a variety of constructs have been proposed to explain diagnostic errors, the complex interplay of cognitive- and system-factors that underlie these errors is rarely clear to the clinicians. In this write-up, we discuss the reasons for diagnostic errors and how medical students can be trained to avoid such errors. The errors have been classified as Cognitive errors, System errors, and No-fault errors, and cognitive interventions to address each of these are detailed."
Estimation of the censoring distribution in clinical trials,CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS COMMUNICATIONS,"Clinical studies with time to event endpoints typically report the median follow-up (i.e., censoring) time for the subjects in the trial, alongside the median time to event. The reason for this is to provide information about the opportunity for subjects in the study to experience the event of interest (Betensky, 2015 [1]). The median follow-up time is often calculated from the Kaplan-Meier estimate for time to censoring. In most clinical studies, the censoring time is a composite measure, defined as the minimum of time to drop-out from the study and time to administrative end of study. The time to drop-out component may or may not be observed; it is observed only if drop-out occurs before the event and the end of the study. However, the time to end of study is observed for each subject, as it is the time from entry to the study to the calendar date that is administratively set as the end of the study. It is known even for subjects who have the event prior to the end of the study. This decomposition of the censoring time into a time that is itself potentially censored and a time that is fully observed raises the interesting question of whether estimation of the censoring distribution could be improved through a decoupling of these times. We demonstrate in simulations that consideration of censoring in this way yields reduced variability under some circumstances and should be used in practice. We illustrate these concepts through application to a meningioma study."
Why hand hygiene is not sufficient: modeling hygiene competence of clinical staff as a basis for its development and assessment,GMS JOURNAL FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Adhering to hygiene standards in daily clinical work is an important characteristic of qualitatively high-value medical care. In this regards, hand hygiene is often focused on in the literature. From the viewpoint of medical education research, we argue that this focus is too narrow to explain how staff who are working clinically with patients implement and adhere to standards of hygiene across a wide variety of tasks of their daily clinical routine. We present basic features of a differentiated concept of hygiene competence, which includes specialized knowledge, corresponding inner attitudes, and action routines that are customized to the needs of specific situations. Building on that, we present a current simulation-based course concept aimed at developing hygiene competence in medical education. Furthermore, we describe a test instrument that is designed according to the principle of a situational judgment test and that appears promising for the assessment of hygiene competence. The course and the measurement instrument are discussed in regards to their fit to the competence model and the related perspectives for research and teaching."
COMPUTERS AS CLINICIAN - AN UPDATE,COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE,"Computers as clinicians entered medical settings relatively recently, but with limited success because they lack general intelligence-that is, though they can be experts in domain specific specialties, they cannot yet deal with clinical problems never before encountered. SOAR, a novel AI computer programming architecture, can learn from past encounters with prior problems and can generalize its learning to new ones. It may therefore take computers to a higher level of clinical performance."
Simulated settings; powerful arenas for learning patient safety practices and facilitating transference to clinical practice. A mixed method study,NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE,"Poor teamwork is an important factor in the occurrence of critical incidents because of a lack of nontechnical skills. Team training can be a key to prevent these incidents. The purpose of this study was to explore the experience of nursing and medical students after a simulation-based interprofessional team training (SBITT) course and its impact on professional and patient safety practices, using a concurrent mixed-method design. The participants (n = 262) were organized into 44 interprofessional teams. The results showed that two training sequences the same day improved overall team performance. Making mistakes during SBITT appeared to improve the quality of patient care once the students returned to clinical practice as it made the students more vigilant. Furthermore, the video-assisted oral debriefing provided an opportunity to strengthen interprofessional teamwork and share situational awareness. SBITI gave the students an opportunity to practice clinical reasoning skills and to share professional knowledge. The students conveyed the importance of learning to speak up to ensure safe patient practices. Simulated settings seem to be powerful arenas for learning patient safety practices and facilitating transference of this awareness to clinical practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Dawn simulation vs. bright light in seasonal affective disorder: Treatment effects and subjective preference,JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS,"Background: Studies comparing the efficacy of dawn simulation to conventional bright light for the treatment of seasonal affective disorder (in parallel groups) have yielded conflicting results. This crossover study investigated treatment outcomes and long-term treatment preference. Methods: Forty winter depressives were treated for a week with bright light (4.300 lx for 30-45 min shortly after awakening) or dawn simulation (gradually increasing light during the last 30 min of sleep achieving 100 lx before alarm beep, with the dawn simulator placed closer to the open eyes for a further 15 min: 250 lx). The depression level was self-rated using SIGH-SAD-SR. Results: Depression scores reduced similarly following bright light and dawn simulation: for 43.8% and 42.2% (medians), respectively; efficacy ratio was 23:17. The preference was also similar (21:19). Among those who preferred bright light, the most common reason was that they perceived the bright light to be more effective (19/21; it was more effective, p=0.0096; this subgroup tended to have more severe depression) and ease of use (6/21). Among those who preferred the dawn simulator, the reasons were a more natural action (9/19), device compactness and/or Lime-saving (10/19) and in 4 cases where bright light caused eyestrain. Limitations: Not overhead naturalistic light for dawn simulation, self-rating of depression. Conclusions: Dawn simulation is similarly effective to bright light in the treatment of winter depression. Patients with more severe depression tended to report greater improvement with bright light; in such cases, this would outweigh the non-clinical advantages of dawn simulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Investigation of realistic PET simulations incorporating tumor patient's specificity using anthropomorphic models: Creation of an oncology database,MEDICAL PHYSICS,"Purpose: The GATE Monte Carlo simulation toolkit is used for the implementation of realistic PET simulations incorporating tumor heterogeneous activity distributions. The reconstructed patient images include noise from the acquisition process, imaging system's performance restrictions and have limited spatial resolution. For those reasons, the measured intensity cannot be simply introduced in GATE simulations, to reproduce clinical data. Investigation of the heterogeneity distribution within tumors applying partial volume correction (PVC) algorithms was assessed. The purpose of the present study was to create a simulated oncology database based on clinical data with realistic intratumor uptake heterogeneity properties. Methods: PET/CT data of seven oncology patients were used in order to create a realistic tumor database investigating the heterogeneity activity distribution of the simulated tumors. The anthropomorphic models (NURBS based cardiac torso and Zubal phantoms) were adapted to the CT data of each patient, and the activity distribution was extracted from the respective PET data. The patient-specific models were simulated with the Monte Carlo Geant4 application for tomography emission (GATE) in three different levels for each case: (a) using homogeneous activity within the tumor, (b) using heterogeneous activity distribution in every voxel within the tumor as it was extracted from the PET image, and (c) using heterogeneous activity distribution corresponding to the clinical image following PVC. The three different types of simulated data in each case were reconstructed with two iterations and filtered with a 3D Gaussian postfilter, in order to simulate the intratumor heterogeneous uptake. Heterogeneity in all generated images was quantified using textural feature derived parameters in 3D according to the ground truth of the simulation, and compared to clinical measurements. Finally, profiles were plotted in central slices of the tumors, across lines with heterogeneous activity distribution for visual assessment. Results: The accuracy of the simulated database was assessed against the original clinical images. The PVC simulated images matched the clinical ones best. Local, regional, and global features extracted from the PVC simulated images were closest to the clinical measurements, with the exception of the size zone variability and the mean intensity values, where heterogeneous tumors showed better reproducibility. The profiles on PVC simulated tumors after postfiltering seemed to represent the more realistic heterogeneous regions with respect to the clinical reference. Conclusions: In this study, the authors investigated the input activity map heterogeneity in the GATE simulations of tumors with heterogeneous activity distribution. The most realistic heterogeneous tumors were obtained by inserting PVC activity distributions from the clinical image into the activity map of the simulation. Partial volume effect (PVE) can play a crucial role in the quantification of heterogeneity within tumors and have an important impact on applications such as patient follow-up during treatment and assessment of tumor response to therapy. The development of such a database incorporating patient anatomical and functional variability can be used to evaluate new image processing or analysis algorithms, while providing control of the ground truth, which is not available when dealing with clinical datasets. The database includes all images used and generated in this study, as well as the sinograms and the attenuation phantoms for further investigation.

The effectiveness of critical thinking instructional strategies in health professions education: a systematic review,STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION,"This review intends to reveal the current status of the instructional practices used to enhance Critical Thinking (CrT), Clinical Reasoning and Clinical Judgement (CJ) skills and dispositions in Health Sciences Higher Education programmes. After a three-step filtering process, 28 empirical studies on the effectiveness of the instructional strategies were analysed, following PICOS methodology. The analysis tackled the type of strategy, methods and outcomes, the research design, and assessment tools used. Diverse instructional designs, different in length, were used with variable success when compared with traditional lecturing. Several limitations were found, such as insufficient information regarding the intervention design and the alignment between learning outcomes and the assessment instruments. Due to the variability in sample sizes and research designs, it is difficult to conclude on the effectiveness of particular instructional strategies. Researchers ought to recognize the concerns herein discussed when designing, implementing and assessing future interventions."
Role of pelvic ultrasound simulation,CLINICAL TEACHER,"Background Pelvic ultrasound is a critical diagnostic imaging tool in obstetrics and gynaecology. Training opportunities in transvaginal ultrasound have not kept pace with the demand among learners because of the increased complexity of modern ultrasound technology and duty-hour restrictions. Ultrasound simulation training has the potential to overcome this gap. Training opportunities in transvaginal ultrasound have not kept pace with the demand Objective Methods Our study aimed to determine the usefulness, applicability and attitudes toward pelvic ultrasound simulation training among residents, sonographers and practising doctors. Pelvic ultrasound simulation activity using high-fidelity virtual reality ultrasound simulators lasted 4 hours and consisted of three modules: abnormal uterine bleeding, adnexal masses and bleeding in pregnancy. All learners completed a pre- and post-encounter quiz, and an anonymous post-simulation survey on the relevance of ultrasound simulation to clinical learning, and its usefulness to improve scanning performance and interpretation skills. Results Conclusions Thirty-one participants attended the workshop, and 28 (90.3%) of them responded to the survey. Five respondents agreed and 23 strongly agreed that pelvic ultrasound simulation applies to their clinical ultrasound practice, and seven of them agreed and 21 strongly agreed that their performance of ultrasound and interpretation skills will be improved following their simulation training. The average post-activity knowledge score for all three topics significantly increased (paired Student's t-test, p < 0.0001). All 28 respondents believe that ultrasound simulation is a useful complement to learning with real patients, with the potential to improve their pelvic ultrasound performance, interpretation skills and clinical reasoning."
The role of simulation in surgical practice and the creation of a new tool for neurosurgical training,SCIENTIA MEDICA,"AIMS: To test a new tool for neurosurgical education, a puzzle to simulate the craniosynostosis surgical correction (specifically scaphocephaly) using Renier's H technique. METHODS: The cranial model was created by obtaining images through a multi slice (1 mm) CT scan in the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format. This information was then processed using a computing algorithm to generate a three-dimensional biomodel in resine (performed on a computer or via computer simulation). The puzzle and its training possibilities were evaluated qualitatively by a team of expert neurosurgeons. Subsequently the experts evaluated the application of the tool for residents in neurosurgery, and the residents also evaluated the experience. RESULTS: Five experts neurosurgeons and 10 neurosurgery residents participated in the evaluation. All considered the tool positive for the proposed training. The experts have commented on how interesting the model may be by instigating the understanding of the reasons for each surgical step and how to act in them. According to the experts perceptions, the residents presented better clarity in the three-dimensional visualization of the step by step, indirectly aiding in the understanding of the surgical technique. In addition, they noted a notable reduction of errors with each attempt to assemble the puzzle. Residents considered it to be a teaching method that makes assessment objective and clear. Among the interviewers, 9,9 was the averaged note given to the simulator. CONCLUSIONS: The puzzle in cranial shape can be a complementary tool, allowing varying degrees of immersion and realism. It provides a notion of physical reality, offering symbolic, geometric and dynamic information, with rich tridimensional visualization. The simulator use may potentially improve and abbreviate the surgeons learning curve, in a safe manner."
Concept Analysis of Clinical Judgment in Nursing Students: A Hybrid Model,IRANIAN RED CRESCENT MEDICAL JOURNAL,"Background: Clinical judgment (CJ) is a complex process and is one of the most important concepts in the domain of education of the nursing students. Despite the special importance of its concept in nursing, this term still has not created an equal perception in the minds of many experts in the nursing education and no study has been done in order to define and explain this concept by concept analysis of the CJ in the educational domain. Objectives: The current study was done with the purpose of determining dimensions and features of this concept in the domain of clinical education of nursing students in Iran. Methods: The design of this study is qualitative with concept analysis method and hybrid model approach. It was done in three phases that were described by Walker and Avant. In the theoretical stage, reviews on the related and valid articles were accomplished. The articles were assessed and analyzed in order to present the working definition. In the stage of field work, the interview was done with 17 participants including 7 nursing students, 6 teachers, and 4 clinical instructors. In the final stage, the general analysis was done and the antecedents, attributes, and the consequences of the concept were extracted. Results: According to the final analysis, CJ for the nursing students is a cognitive and reasoning process, in order to achieve which, the nursing students by guidance of teachers in a secure clinical environment, assess the patients' needs, interpret, and evaluate the patients' response to the clinical practice and then reflect and perform the critical evaluation of the patients' conditions. In the meanwhile, making effective clinical decisions, increasing the trust of patient and quality of care, the necessary conditions for the promotion of their professional competence will be provided. Conclusions: In the concept analysis of CJ, some of the needed conditions for CJ in the nursing students have not been reported in the studies."
As Accessible as a Book on a Library Shelf The Imperative of Routine Simulation in Modern Health Care,CHEST,"Technology-enhanced patient simulation has emerged as an important new modality for teaching and learning in medicine. In particular, immersive simulation platforms that replicate the clinical environment promise to revolutionize medical education by enabling an enhanced level of safety, standardization, and efficiency across health-care training. Such an experiential approach seems unique in reliably catalyzing a level of emotional engagement that fosters immediate and indelible learning and allows for increasingly reliable levels of performance evaluation-all in a completely risk-free environment. As such, medical simulation is poised to emerge as a critical component of training and certification throughout health care, promising to fundamentally enhance quality and safety across disciplines. To encourage routine simulation-based practice as part of its core quality and safety mission, Massachusetts General Hospital now incorporates simulation resources within its historic medical library (est. 1847), located at the center of the campus. In this new model, learners go to the library not only to read about a patient's illness, but also to take care of their patient. Such an approach redefines and advances the central role of the library on the campus and ensures that simulation-based practice is centrally available as part of everyday hospital operations. This article describes the reasons for identifying simulation as an institutional priority leading up to the Massachusetts General Hospital Bicentennial Celebration (1811-2011) and for creating a simulation-based learning laboratory within a hospital library.

Urology technical and non-technical skills development: the emerging role of simulation,BJU INTERNATIONAL,"Objective To review the emerging role of technical and non-technical simulation in urological education and training. Method A review was conducted to examine the current role of simulation in urology training. A PUBMED search of the terms 'urology training', 'urology simulation' and 'urology education' revealed 11 504 titles. Three hundred and fifty-seven abstracts were identified as English language, peer reviewed papers pertaining to the role of simulation in urology and related topics. Key papers were used to explore themes. Some cross-referenced papers were also included. Results There is an ongoing need to ensure that training time is efficiently utilised while ensuring that optimal technical and non-technical skills are achieved. Changing working conditions and the need to minimise patient harm by inadvertent errors must be taken into account. Simulation models for specific technical aspects have been the mainstay of graduated step-wise low and high fidelity training. Whole scenario environments as well as non-technical aspects can be slowly incorporated into the curriculum. Doing so should also help define what have been challenging competencies to teach and evaluate. Dedicated time, resources and trainer up-skilling are important. Concurrent studies are needed to help evaluate the effectiveness of introducing step-wise simulation for technical and non-technical competencies. Conclusion Simulation based learning remains the best avenue of progressing surgical education. Technical and non-technical simulation could be used in the selection process. There are good economic, logistic and safety reasons to pursue the process of ongoing development of simulation co-curricula. While the role of simulation is assured, its progress will depend on a structured program that takes advantage of what can be delivered via this medium. Overall, simulation can be developed further for urological training programs to encompass technical and non-technical skill development at all stages, including recertification."
A design of experiments approach to validation sampling for logistic regression modeling with error-prone medical records,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,"Background and Objective Electronic medical record (EMR) databases offer significant potential for developing clinical hypotheses and identifying disease risk associations by fitting statistical models that capture the relationship between a binary response variable and a set of predictor variables that represent clinical, phenotypical, and demographic data for the patient. However, EMR response data may be error prone for a variety of reasons. Performing a manual chart review to validate data accuracy is time consuming, which limits the number of chart reviews in a large database. The authors' objective is to develop a new design-of-experiments-based systematic chart validation and review (DSCVR) approach that is more powerful than the random validation sampling used in existing approaches. Methods The DSCVR approach judiciously and efficiently selects the cases to validate (i.e., validate whether the response values are correct for those cases) for maximum information content, based only on their predictor variable values. The final predictive model will be fit using only the validation sample, ignoring the remainder of the unvalidated and unreliable error-prone data. A Fisher information based D-optimality criterion is used, and an algorithm for optimizing it is developed. Results The authors' method is tested in a simulation comparison that is based on a sudden cardiac arrest case study with 23 041 patients' records. This DSCVR approach, using the Fisher information based D-optimality criterion, results in a fitted model with much better predictive performance, as measured by the receiver operating characteristic curve and the accuracy in predicting whether a patient will experience the event, than a model fitted using a random validation sample. Conclusions The simulation comparisons demonstrate that this DSCVR approach can produce predictive models that are significantly better than those produced from random validation sampling, especially when the event rate is low."
Unfolding case study and Mask-Ed (TM) high fidelity simulation for chronic illness education: A case study,COLLEGIAN,"Student learning of effective care provision for people with chronic illness is an important component of pre-registration nursing curricula and demands specific knowledge and skills. This paper discusses the implementation of the combined pedagogy of unfolding case study and Mask-EdTM high fidelity simulation within a 12 week unit on chronic illness in an Australian Bachelor of Nursing program. The unfolding case study develops clinical reasoning and decision making through facilitating students to progress through a case study as it develops in complexity. Mask-Ed(TM) is a high fidelity simulation technique in which a knowledgeable educator portrays an authentic character, but remains hidden from students by a silicone disguise. Using this combined pedagogy creates a unique and innovative opportunity to engage students in learning about the chronic illness experience. This pedagogy can support students to gain a holistic understanding of the psychosocial and physical health care needs of patients and their families and develop their therapeutic skills and clinical judgment. Integration of these interactive learning techniques has the potential to transform student learning about person-centred care within pre-registration curricula.

Virtual patient simulation: what do students make of it? A focus group study,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background: The learners' perspectives on Virtual Patient Simulation systems (VPS) are quintessential to their successful development and implementation. Focus group interviews were conducted in order to explore the opinions of medical students on the educational use of a VPS, the Web-based Simulation of Patients application (Web-SP). Methods: Two focus group interviews-each with 8 undergraduate students who had used Web-SP cases for learning and/or assessment as part of their Internal Medicine curriculum in 2007-were performed at the Faculty of Medicine of Universidad el Bosque (Bogota), in January 2008. The interviews were conducted in Spanish, transcribed by the main researcher and translated into English. The resulting transcripts were independently coded by two authors, who also performed the content analysis. Each coder analyzed the data separately, arriving to categories and themes, whose final form was reached after a consensus discussion. Results: Eighteen categories were identified and clustered into five main themes: learning, teaching, assessment, authenticity and implementation. In agreement with the literature, clinical reasoning development is envisaged by students to be the main scope of VPS use; transferable skills, retention enhancement and the importance of making mistakes are other categories circumscribed to this theme. VPS should enjoy a broad use across clinical specialties and support learning of topics not seen during clinical rotations; they are thought to have a regulatory effect at individual level, helping the students to plan their learning. The participants believe that assessment with VPS should be relevant for their future clinical practice; it is deemed to be qualitatively different from regular exams and to increase student motivation. The VPS design and content, the localization of the socio-cultural context, the realism of the cases, as well as the presence and quality of feedback are intrinsic features contributing to VPS authenticity. Conclusions: Five main themes were found to be associated with successful VPS use in medical curriculum: Learning, Teaching, Assessment, Authenticity and Implementation. Medical students perceive Virtual Patients as important learning and assessment tools, fostering clinical reasoning, in preparation for the future clinical practice as young doctors. However, a number of issues regarding VPS design, authenticity and implementation need to be fulfilled, in order to reach the potential educational goals of such applications."
"Tissue-scale, personalized modeling and simulation of prostate cancer growth",PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,"Recently, mathematical modeling and simulation of diseases and their treatments have enabled the prediction of clinical outcomes and the design of optimal therapies on a personalized (i.e., patient-specific) basis. This new trend in medical research has been termed predictive medicine. Prostate cancer (PCa) is a major health problem and an ideal candidate to explore tissue-scale, personalized modeling of cancer growth for two main reasons: First, it is a small organ, and, second, tumor growth can be estimated by measuring serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA, a PCa biomarker in blood), which may enable in vivo validation. In this paper, we present a simple continuous model that reproduces the growth patterns of PCa. We use the phase-field method to account for the transformation of healthy cells to cancer cells and use diffusion-reaction equations to compute nutrient consumption and PSA production. To accurately and efficiently compute tumor growth, our simulations leverage isogeometric analysis (IGA). Our model is shown to reproduce a known shape instability from a spheroidal pattern to fingered growth. Results of our computations indicate that such shift is a tumor response to escape starvation, hypoxia, and, eventually, necrosis. Thus, branching enables the tumor to minimize the distance from inner cells to external nutrients, contributing to cancer survival and further development. We have also used our model to perform tissue-scale, personalized simulation of a PCa patient, based on prostatic anatomy extracted from computed tomography images. This simulation shows tumor progression similar to that seen in clinical practice."
Simulation in the Internal Medicine Clerkship: A National Survey of Internal Medicine Clerkship Directors,TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE,"Background: Simulation in medical education offers the promise of safely and effectively preparing trainees for a variety of tasks encountered in clinical medicine. Purpose: The objective was to determine internal medicine (IM) clerkship directors' perceptions of the use of simulations during the medicine clerkship. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 110 Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine (CDIM) institutional members was presented. The survey contained 24 questions including multiple-choice responses with Likert scale and open-ended questions. Descriptive and correlational statistical analyses were performed. A thematic qualitative analysis was performed. Results: Response rate was 78% (86/110). Simulation was used in the IM clerkship in 84% (72) of responding schools. Simulations were used to teach a variety of clinical skills and concepts such as history taking and diagnostic reasoning. The intended goal of simulations was teaching in 39% (28), formative assessment in 49% (35), summative assessment in 38% (27), and compliance with Liaison Council for Medical Education requirements in 19% (14). Most of clerkships (54%, 49) use standardized patients, with 37.5 % (27) using them for formative purposes, whereas 33% (24) used them for summative purposes. Support for simulation was provided by the school of medicine in 57% (41) of clerkships, by the department of medicine in 30% (22) of clerkships. Conclusions: Simulations are used to teach clinical skills and for formative and summative assessments. Standardized patients and simulation mannequins are the most commonly used simulations types. Further research is needed to assess clerkship directors' needs, knowledge, and use of simulation in specific learning and training contexts."
"Emergency obstetric simulation training: How do we know where we are going, if we don't know where we have been?",AUSTRALIAN & NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNAECOLOGY,"BackgroundObstetric emergencies contribute significantly to maternal morbidity and mortality. Current training in the management of obstetric emergencies in Australia and internationally focusses on utilising a multidisciplinary simulation-based model. Arguments for and against this type of training exist, using both economic and clinical reasoning. AimsTo identify the evidence base for the clinical impact of simulation training in obstetric emergencies and to address some of the concerns regarding appropriate delivery of obstetric emergency training in the Australian setting. MethodsA literature search was performed to identify research undertaken in the area of obstetric emergency training. The initial literature search using broad search terms identified 887 articles which were then reviewed and considered for inclusion if they provided original research with a specific emphasis on the impact of training on clinical outcomes. ResultsNinety-two articles were identified, comprising evidence in the following clinical situations: eclampsia, shoulder dystocia, postpartum haemorrhage, maternal collapse, cord prolapse and teamwork training. Evidence exists for a benefit in knowledge or skills gained from simulation training and for the benefit of training in small units without access to high-fidelity equipment or facilities. ConclusionsEvidence exists for a positive impact of training in obstetric emergencies, although the majority of the available evidence applies to evaluation at the level of participants' confidence, knowledge or skills rather than at the level of impact on clinical outcomes. The model of simulation-based training is an appropriate one for the Australian setting and should be further utilised in rural and remote settings."
Perspective: Clinical Communication Education in the United Kingdom: Some Fresh Insights,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,"Clinical communication education is now part of the core curriculum of every medical school in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has emerged over 30 years because of various societal, political, and policy drivers and is supported by an impressive evidence base. For a variety of reasons, however, clinical communication has become separated from other parts of medical education and tends to be positioned in the early years of the curriculum, when students have limited experience of being in the clinical workplace and working with patients. The teachers of clinical communication, whether medical-school-based or clinically based, may not share learning goals for the subject and this may, therefore, provide a disintegrated learning experience for students. Clinical communication teachers need to inject fresh thinking into the teaching and learning of the subject to unite it with clinical practice in the authentic clinical workplace. Engaging with theories of workplace learning, which aim to overcome the theory/practice gap in vocational education, may be the way forward. The author suggests various ways that this might be achieved-for example, by situating clinical communication education throughout the whole undergraduate curriculum, by integrating the topic of clinical communication with other areas of medical education, by developing coteaching and curriculum design partnerships between medical school and clinical workplace, and by developing a greater range of postgraduate education that offers opportunities for professional development in clinical communication for qualified doctors that is complementary with what is taught in undergraduate education."
DISCRETE EVENT SIMULATION OF WHOLE CARE PATHWAYS TO ESTIMATE COST-EFFECTIVENESS IN CLINICAL GUIDELINES,2015 WINTER SIMULATION CONFERENCE (WSC),"For pragmatic reasons, cost-effectiveness analyses performed for NICE Clinical Guidelines use a piecemeal approach, evaluating only selected aspects of diagnosis, treatment or care. A Whole Pathway approach, considering diagnosis-to-death, may provide more realistic estimates of costs and health outcomes, taking account of the healthcare context and individual risk factors, history and choices for patients with long-term conditions. A patient-level DES model using the characteristics of 12,766 real patients was created to reflect the NICE guideline for Atrial Fibrillation. Of eight topics suggested for inclusion in an update of the guideline, the model was capable of fully answering four topics, and partially answering two topics. The remaining topics were beyond the scope of the model. The model was used by NICE in their recent update of the Atrial Fibrillation Clinical Guidelines."
Nursing students' perceptions of a video-based serious game's educational value: A pilot study,NURSE EDUCATION TODAY,"Background: Despite an increasing number of serious games (SGs) in nursing education, few evaluation studies specifically address their educational value in terms of face, content, and construct validity. Objectives: To assess nursing students' perceptions of a video-based SG in terms of face, content, and construct validity. In addition, the study assessed perceptions of usability, individual factors, and preferences regarding future use. Design: A pilot study was conducted. Setting and Participants: An SG prototype was implemented as part of two simulation courses in nursing education: one for home health care and one for hospital medical-surgical wards. The SG aimed to teach clinical reasoning and decision-making skills to nursing students caring for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A total of 249 second-year nursing students participated in pilot testing of the SG. Method: A paper-based survey was used to assess students' perceptions of the SG's educational value. Results: Overall, students from both simulation courses perceived the SG as educationally valuable and easy to use. No significant differences were found in perceptions of educational value between nursing students with previous healthcare experience versus those with none. However, significantly more students in the home healthcare simulation course indicated that the SG tested their clinical reasoning and decision-making skills. Students from both the medical-surgical and home healthcare simulation courses suggested that more video based SGs should be developed and used in nursing education. Conclusions: Overall, the survey results indicate that the participants perceived the SG as educationally valuable, and that the SG has potential as an educational tool in nursing education, especially in caring for patients with chronic diseases and in home healthcare simulation. Showing a SG's educational value and user acceptance among nursing students may justify the development and application of more SGs in nursing education."
Establishing Inter- and Intrarater Reliability for High-Stakes Testing Using Simulation,NURSING EDUCATION PERSPECTIVES,"AIM This article reports one method to develop a standardized training method to establish the inter-and intrarater reliability of a group of raters for high-stakes testing. BACKGROUND Simulation is used increasingly for high-stakes testing, but without research into the development of inter-and intrarater reliability for raters. METHOD Eleven raters were trained using a standardized methodology. Raters scored 28 student videos over a six-week period. Raters then rescored all videos over a two-day period to establish both intra-and interrater reliability. RESULTS One rater demonstrated poor intrarater reliability; a second rater failed all students. Kappa statistics improved from the moderate to substantial agreement range with the exclusion of the two outlier raters' scores. CONCLUSION There may be faculty who, for different reasons, should not be included in high-stakes testing evaluations. All faculty are content experts, but not all are expert evaluators."
Transparent decision support for mechanical ventilation using visualization of clinical preferences,BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE,"Background Systems aiding in selecting the correct settings for mechanical ventilation should visualize patient information at an appropriate level of complexity, so as to reduce information overload and to make reasoning behind advice transparent. Metaphor graphics have been applied to this effect, but these have largely been used to display diagnostic and physiologic information, rather than the clinical decision at hand. This paper describes how the conflicting goals of mechanical ventilation can be visualized and applied in making decisions. Data from previous studies are analyzed to assess whether visual patterns exist which may be of use to the clinical decision maker. Materials and methods The structure and screen visualizations of a commercial clinical decision support system (CDSS) are described, including the visualization of the conflicting goals of mechanical ventilation represented as a hexagon. Retrospective analysis is performed on 95 patients from 2 previous clinical studies applying the CDSS, to identify repeated patterns of hexagon symbols. Results Visual patterns were identified describing optimal ventilation, over and under ventilation and pressure support, and over oxygenation, with these patterns identified for both control and support modes of mechanical ventilation. Numerous clinical examples are presented for these patterns illustrating their potential interpretation at the bedside. Conclusions Visual patterns can be identified which describe the trade-offs required in mechanical ventilation. These may have potential to reduce information overload and help in simple and rapid identification of sub-optimal settings."
Clinical information displays to improve ICU outcomes,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS,"Purpose: In a previous study, we compared a prototype ecological display (ED) that represented physiological data in a structured pictorial format with two bar graph displays [J.A. Effken, Improving clinical decision making through ecological interfaces, Ecol. Psych. 18 (2006) 283-318]. In ED and the first bar graph display, data were grouped hierarchically based on a cognitive work analysis (CWA); in the second bar graph display they were grouped as usually collected. Treatment efficiency (i.e., percentage of time seven variables in the CWA model were in target range) improved similarly with the two displays incorporating the CWA order for intensive care unit (ICU) residents, but not for novice ICU nurses. Hypothesized reasons for this result included: insufficient practice with novel displays; use of identical histories across displays; insufficient clinical knowledge; and the variables used in the efficiency analysis, which included only one of ED's four integrated design elements. In the current study we tested these hypotheses. Methods: We asked ICU nurses assigned to three knowledge groups based on intensive care and hemodynamic monitoring pretests to identify and treat oxygenation problems presented via ED and the first bar graph display (BGD) in an experimental laboratory simulation. We measured the impact of display, clinical scenario, data level, knowledge, presentation order, and practice extent on event recognition, treatment efficiency, cognitive workload, and user satisfaction. Results: The two displays produced little difference in recognition speed or overall cognitive workload, but user satisfaction was greater with ED. When 12 variables were included in the analysis, treatment efficiency improved with ED; when only 7 were measured, BGD prevailed. The results suggest benefits for the kind of synthesis provided in ED, but also a potential limitation. If too many different pictorial formats are used in a display, detecting critical events may be more difficult. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
Student perception of two different simulation techniques in oral and maxillofacial surgery undergraduate training,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background: Yearly surveys among the undergraduate students in oral and maxillofacial surgery at Karolinska Institutet have conveyed a wish for increased clinical training, and in particular, in surgical removal of mandibular third molars. Due to lack of resources, this kind of clinical supervision has so far not been possible to implement. One possible solution to this problem might be to introduce simulation into the curriculum. The purpose of this study was to investigate undergraduate students' perception of two different simulation methods for practicing clinical reasoning skills and technical skills in oral and maxillofacial surgery. Methods: Forty-seven students participating in the oral and maxillofacial surgery course at Karolinska Institutet during their final year were included. Three different oral surgery patient cases were created in a Virtual Patient (VP) Simulation system (Web-SP) and used for training clinical reasoning. A mandibular third molar surgery simulator with tactile feedback, providing hands on training in the bone removal and tooth sectioning in third molar surgery, was also tested. A seminar was performed using the combination of these two simulators where students' perception of the two different simulation methods was assessed by means of a questionnaire. Results: The response rate was 91.5% (43/47). The students were positive to the VP cases, although they rated their possible improvement of clinical reasoning skills as moderate. The students' perception of improved technical skills after training in the mandibular third molar surgery simulator was rated high. The majority of the students agreed that both simulation techniques should be included in the curriculum and strongly agreed that it was a good idea to use the two simulators in concert. The importance of feedback from the senior experts during simulator training was emphasised. Conclusions: The two tested simulation methods were well accepted and most students agreed that the future curriculum would benefit from permanent inclusion of these exercises, especially when used in combination. The results also stress the importance of teaching technical skills and clinical reasoning in concert."
Curriculum Mapping with Academic Analytics in Medical and Healthcare Education,PLOS ONE,"Background No universal solution, based on an approved pedagogical approach, exists to parametrically describe, effectively manage, and clearly visualize a higher education institution's curriculum, including tools for unveiling relationships inside curricular datasets. Objective We aim to solve the issue of medical curriculum mapping to improve understanding of the complex structure and content of medical education programs. Our effort is based on the long-term development and implementation of an original web-based platform, which supports an outcomes-based approach to medical and healthcare education and is suitable for repeated updates and adoption to curriculum innovations. Methods We adopted data exploration and visualization approaches in the context of medical curriculum innovations in higher education institutions domain. We have developed a robust platform, covering detailed formal metadata specifications down to the level of learning units, interconnections, and learning outcomes, in accordance with Bloom's taxonomy and direct links to a particular biomedical nomenclature. Furthermore, we used selected modeling techniques and data mining methods to generate academic analytics reports from medical curriculum mapping datasets. Results We present a solution that allows users to effectively optimize a curriculum structure that is described with appropriate metadata, such as course attributes, learning units and outcomes, a standardized vocabulary nomenclature, and a tree structure of essential terms. We present a case study implementation that includes effective support for curriculum reengineering efforts of academics through a comprehensive overview of the General Medicine study program. Moreover, we introduce deep content analysis of a dataset that was captured with the use of the curriculum mapping platform; this may assist in detecting any potentially problematic areas, and hence it may help to construct a comprehensive overview for the subsequent global in-depth medical curriculum inspection. Conclusions We have proposed, developed, and implemented an original framework for medical and healthcare curriculum innovations and harmonization, including: planning model, mapping model, and selected academic analytics extracted with the use of data mining."
"Interprofessional education: A disaster response simulation activity for military medics, nursing, & paramedic science students",NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE,"Health care providers need to be able to function and react appropriately and efficiently during a community-wide disaster situation. Traditional health care education is not adequately structured to provide realistic experiences with respect to high-risk or infrequently encountered events such as a disaster. As a result, many healthcare providers graduate into practice with inadequate exposure or skills to intervene in a disastrous event. Previous studies validate that active participation by students during a simulation can translate into positive, meaningful learning applicable to practice. This paper describes how a disaster response simulation can be utilized as an innovative experiential learning technique. Additionally, interprofessional collaboration and positive learning experiences were fostered between military trainees and health care students in nursing and paramedic sciences. The constructivist framework utilized enabled educators to incorporate interprofessional collaboration, clinical reasoning, and technical skills in the safe learning environment of a simulation."
As time goes by: Stakeholder opinions on the implementation and use of a virtual patient simulation system,MEDICAL TEACHER,"Background: Stakeholder opinions on the implementation of a particular virtual patient application might prove important for decision-making and implementation efforts in general. This study aimed to capitalize on experiences originated from two post-implementation settings of Web-based Simulation of Patients (Web-SP). Method: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of stakeholder opinions (39 students, teachers, course directors, and university leaders) on the implementation and use of Web-SP in Colombia and Sweden, using a mixed method approach. Results: The respondents did not show equal preference in rating the ranking of the order of importance included in the variables (Friedman's Chi square: 26.5 to 115.1, df=6, p < 0.001, Kendall's coefficient of concordance ranging from 0.11 to 0.50). The answers provided as free comments supported the statistical findings on the importance of end-user customization, need for authenticity in software design, and use of virtual patient simulations in a curricular context, for clinical reasoning development. Conclusions: Virtual Patient design should allow extensive editing, support case authenticity and enhance clinical reasoning abilities, in an effort for ensuring accountability and sustainable development of the field."
Exploring mobile mixed reality in healthcare higher education: A systematic review,RESEARCH IN LEARNING TECHNOLOGY,"Background: The evolution of technology and simulation has had a significant impact on clinical education. However, it remains grounded in traditional teaching paradigms, limiting potential for enhanced learning. Furthermore, the impact of mixed reality enabled mobile devices remains underexplored. Purpose: The aim of this article was to investigate mobile learning and mixed reality in healthcare higher education. Method: A search of six databases from the earliest available date to 30 February 2018 and a hand search of journals and included studies was performed. Inclusion criteria focused on 'healthcare', 'higher education', 'mobile learning' and 'mixed reality'. All study designs were included, though they were limited to the English language. The checklist of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis was used as a framework for the review, with included studies critiqued using the mixed methods appraisal tool. Results: The search generated 1484 studies, with 18 meeting inclusion criteria. The majority of studies utilised mobile mixed reality (mMR) for teaching procedural skills with established mobile platforms; anatomy; and clinical assessment. mMR demonstrated benefits in skill competency and knowledge scores when compared to control. Users were favourable towards future use of mMR. Conclusion: While mMR successfully delivered some clinical skills; the pedagogical impact of engagement with higher order clinical reasoning remains a challenge for future studies."
A Bayesian approach to aid in formulary decision making: Incorporating institution-specific cost-effectiveness data with clinical trial results,MEDICAL DECISION MAKING,"Pharmacy and therapeutics committees commonly cite a lack of generalizability as a reason for not incorporating cost-effectiveness information into decision making. To address this concern, many committees undertake site-specific economic evaluations, which are often limited by small sample sizes and nonrandomized designs. We show how 2 complementary approaches were used to minimize these limitations in an economic evaluation of abciximab at 1 institution. Using a propensity score methodology, we selected patients who did not receive abciximab for the comparison cohort. Then, we adopted a Bayesian, hierarchical, random-effects model to integrate site-specific and clinical trial data. We applied the posterior distributions of effectiveness with local cost data in a traditional decision-analytic model. In 74% of the simulations, abciximab was cost-effective at 1 institution at the $50,000 per life year saved threshold, assuming a 50:50 split of patients undergoing coronary stenting and angioplasty. Among patients undergoing coronary stenting, the cost-effectiveness ratio of the addition of abciximab was at or below the $50,000 per life year saved threshold in 66.0% of the simulations. Key words: Bayesian analysis; cost-effectiveness; decision making; formulary decision making; Monte Carlo simulation. (Med Decis Making 2003;23:252264)."
Constructing a representative in-silico population for paediatric simulations: Application to HIV-positive African children,BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,"Aims Simulations are an essential tool for investigating scenarios in pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics. The models used during simulation often include the effect of highly correlated covariates such as weight, height and sex, and for children also age, which complicates the construction of an in silico population. For this reason, a suitable and representative patient population is crucial for the simulations to produce meaningful results. For simulation in paediatric patients, international growth charts from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provide a reference, but these may not always be representative for specific populations, such as malnourished children with HIV or acutely unwell children. Methods We present a workflow to construct a virtual paediatric patient population using WHO and CDC growth charts, suggest piecewise linear functions to adjust the median of the growth charts by sex and age, and suggest visual diagnostics to compare with the target population. We applied this workflow in a population of 1206 HIV-positive African children, consisting of 19 742 observations with weight ranging from 3.8 to 79.7 kg, height from 55.5 to 180 cm, and an age between 0.40 and 18 years. Results Before adjustment, the WHO and CDC charts produced weights and heights higher compared to the observed data. After applying our methodology, we could simulate weight, height, sex and age combinations in good agreement with the observed data. Conclusion The methodology presented here is flexible and may be applied to other scenarios where WHO and CDC growth standards might not be appropriate. In addition we provide R scripts and a large ready-to-use paediatric population."
The influence of integrating clinical practice guideline order bundles into a general admission order set on guideline adoption,JAMIA OPEN,"Objectives of this study were to (1) describe barriers to using clinical practice guideline (CPG) admission order sets in a pediatric hospital and (2) determine if integrating CPG order bundles into a general admission order set increases adoption of CPG-recommended orders compared to standalone CPG order sets. We identified CPG-eligible encounters and surveyed admitting physicians to understand reasons for not using the associated CPG order set. We then integrated CPG order bundles into a general admission order set and evaluated effectiveness through summative usability testing in a simulated environment. The most common reasons for the nonuse of CPG order sets were lack of awareness or forgetting about the CPG order set. In usability testing, CPG order bundle use increased from 27.8% to 66.6% while antibiotic ordering errors decreased from 62.9% to 18.5% with the new design. Integrating CPG-related order bundles into a general admission order set improves CPG order set use in simulation by addressing the most common barriers to CPG adoption."
Competency Based Medical Education-Towards the Development of a Standardized Pediatric Radiology Testing Module,ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY,"Rationale and Objectives: To introduce a process that allows for development of standardized competency based testing modules (CBTM) for evaluating resident progress and competence during their radiology training. This work focuses on the development of pediatric imaging CBTMs to be utilized during general radiology residency. Materials and Methods: Multiple in-patient and ER imaging request audits along with surveys of training programs and text recommendations were obtained. A list of 200 total diagnoses accumulated by review was distributed into one of four CBTM folders. Imaging cases which made >= 90% of the indications of the audits were added to Folder 1. Distribution of remaining imaging diagnoses was based on consensus by three subspecialists. A pilot study was performed with residents dictating selected imaging cases in their usual manner mimicking a typical rotation. Results: The pilot study demonstrated resident grading mean scores significantly associated with both the American College of Radiology (ACR) rank (rho = 0.636, p = 0.035) and the objective structured clinical examinations (OSCE) scores (rho = 0.694, p = 0.018). The mean scores positively associated with the ACR score (rho = 0.466), but fell short of statistical significance (p = 0.149). As expected, the ACR score, ACR rank and OSCE scores all significantly correlated with each other ( < 0.01). PGY also significantly correlated with the ACR score (rho = 0.683, p = 0.021) and the OSCE (rho = 0.767, p = 0.006) but not with the ACR rank (rho = 0.408, p = 0.213). Conclusion: The process utilized to develop a standardized CBTM can be used as a simulation tool to assess radiology resident competence during their training. The format allows for assessment of resident reasoning skills and knowledge base, which provides documentation of progression and throughout residency."
Laparoscopic splenic hilar lymph node dissection for proximal gastric cancer using integrated three-dimensional anatomic simulation software,SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES,"Background Laparoscopic lymph node (LN) dissection along the distal splenic artery (Station No. 11d) and around the splenic hilum (Station No. 10) remains challenging even for skilled surgeons. The major reason for the difficulty is the complex, multifarious anatomy of the splenic vessels. The latest integrated three-dimensional (3D) simulations may facilitate this procedure. Methods Usefulness of 3D simulation was investigated during 20 laparoscopic total gastrectomies with splenic hilar LN dissection while preserving the spleen and pancreas (LTG + PSP) or with splenectomy (LTG + S). Clinical information acquired by 3D simulation and the consistency of the virtual and real images were evaluated. Furthermore, clinical data of these patients were compared with that of the patients who underwent the same surgery before the introduction of 3D simulation (n = 10), to clarify its efficacy. Results The vascular architecture and morphologic characteristics were clearly demonstrated in 3D simulation, with sufficient consistency. The median durations of 14 LTG + PSP and 6 LTG + S operations were 318 and 322 min, respectively. The estimated blood losses were 18 and 38 g, respectively. There were no deaths. One postoperative peritoneal abscess (grade II according to Clavien-Dindo) was recorded. A comparison of clinical parameters between surgeries without or with 3D simulation showed no differences in operation time, blood loss, or complication rate; however, the number of retrieved No. 10 LNs has significantly increased in cases with the use of 3D simulation (p = 0.006). Conclusions This kind of surgery is not easy to perform, but the latest 3D computed tomography simulation technology has made it possible to reduce the degree of difficulty and also to enhance the quality of surgery, potentially leading to widespread use of these techniques."
Quantitative Framework for Retrospective Assessment of Interim Decisions in Clinical Trials,MEDICAL DECISION MAKING,"This article presents a quantitative way of modeling the interim decisions of clinical trials. While statistical approaches tend to focus on the epistemic aspects of statistical monitoring rules, often overlooking ethical considerations, ethical approaches tend to neglect the key epistemic dimension. The proposal is a second-order decision-analytic framework. The framework provides means for retrospective assessment of interim decisions based on a clear and consistent set of criteria that combines both ethical and epistemic considerations. The framework is broadly Bayesian and addresses a fundamental question behind many concerns about clinical trials: What does it take for an interim decision (e.g., whether to stop the trial or continue) to be a good decision? Simulations illustrating the modeling of interim decisions counterfactually are provided."
Simulation of Required CPAP Usage to Normalize AHI in Obstructive Sleep Apnea Patients,"WORLD CONGRESS ON MEDICAL PHYSICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING 2018, VOL 2","Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent disease with severe health consequences. The severity of OSA is estimated with apnea-hypopnea-index (AHI). OSA is often treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The aim of the current work was to create a numerical simulator showing benefits of different levels of usage of CPAP treatment. 226 male OSA patients were evaluated. CPAP treatment was simulated in 5 min intervals starting from the beginning of the night and continuing until the end. The cutoff point where AHI reached normal level of <5 events/h were determined for mild, moderate and severe OSA categories. We found a trend of increasing AHI towards the end of the night. The median values of required simulated CPAP usage times to normalize the AHI values (AHI <5 events/h) were 3.9 h, 5.3 h and 6.2 h in the mild, moderate and severe OSA severity categories, respectively. CPAP treatment adherence can be limited in OSA patients due to several reasons. The presented CPAP treatment simulation tool could aid the clinicians to give patient specific recommendation to the OSA patients for required CPAP treatment times and to motivate the patients to higher adherence levels of the treatment. This could possibly better prevent the harmful health consequences related to OSA."
Implementation of a Web-Based Patient Simulation Program to Teach Dental Students in Oral Surgery,JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION,"The aim of this study was to evaluate a web-based simulation of patients (Web-SP) program on learning skills in clinical reasoning and patient evaluation in the oral surgery education of third-year dental students. A secondary aim was to investigate the program's effect on students' learning, knowledge, and attitudes towards virtual patient simulations. Authentic virtual oral surgery patient cases were created at a dental school in Sweden using the Web-SP platform. The Web-SP program was introduced in a two-hour seminar. A 20 -minute pre-seminar test (test A) was administered to assess the students' knowledge of oral surgery prior to experiencing the Web-SP program. Ten days after the seminar, another test (test B) was administered to evaluate the increase in oral surgery knowledge as a result of using the program, and an emailed survey of the students was conducted. Of 70 students in the course, 67 (95.7%) agreed to participate in the study and took test A; of these, 59 (88%) took test B. Of the 59 students who took both tests, 28 (42%) completed the survey. The results of the two tests showed a statistically significant increase in knowledge, which was in accordance with the learning goals (p<0.0001). The survey results showed that the students had a positive attitude towards the teaching method. In this study, Web-SP was found to be a valuable tool for teaching clinical reasoning and patient evaluation in an undergraduate oral surgery education setting by improving learning outcomes in comparison with traditional teaching alone."
Students' perceptions of vertical and horizontal integration in a discipline-based dental school,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION,"Introduction: Integration is a key concern in discipline-based undergraduate dental curricula. Therefore, this study compared feedback on integration from students who participated in different instructional designs in a Comprehensive Patient Care course. Methods: The study was conducted at the University of Pretoria (2009-2011). Third-year cohorts (Cohorts A, B and C) participated in pre-clinical case-based learning, whilst fourth-year cohorts (Cohorts D and E) received didactic teaching in Comprehensive Patient Care. Cohorts A, D and E practised clinical Comprehensive Patient Care in a discipline-based clinic. Cohort B conducted their Comprehensive Patient Care patient examinations in a dedicated facility supervised by dedicated faculty responsible to teach integration. Students had to indicate on visual analogue scales whether the way they were taught at the school helped them to integrate knowledge from the same (horizontal integration) and preceding (vertical integration) year of study. The end-points of the scales were defined as 'definitely' and 'not at all'. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to measure the differences between cohorts according to the year of study. Results: Third-year case-based learning cohorts rated the horizontal integration close to 80/100 and vertical integration ranging from 64 to 71/100. In year four, Cohort B rated vertical and horizontal integration 9-15% higher (ANOVA, P < 0.05) than Cohorts A and D. In year five, Cohort A rated vertical and horizontal integration 11-18% higher (ANOVA, P < 0.05) than Cohorts D and E. Conclusion: Pre-clinical case-based learning and Comprehensive Patient Care supervised by dedicated faculty were associated with more favourable perceptions about integration in the discipline-based undergraduate dental curriculum."
Learning by viewing versus learning by doing: A comparative study of observer and participant experiences during an interprofessional simulation training,JOURNAL OF INTERPROFESSIONAL CARE,"Larger student groups and pressure on limited faculty time have raised the question of the learning value of merely observing simulation training in emergency medicine, instead of active team participation. The purpose of this study was to examine observers and hands-on participants' self-reported learning outcomes during simulation-based interprofessional team training regarding non-technical skills. In addition, we compared the learning outcomes for different professions and investigated team performance relative to the number of simulations in which they participated. A concurrent mixed-method design was chosen to evaluate the study, using questionnaires, observations, and focus group interviews. Participants included a total of 262 postgraduate and bachelor nursing students and medical students, organised into 44 interprofessional teams. The quantitative data showed that observers and participants had similar results in three of six predefined learning outcomes. The qualitative data emphasised the importance of participating in different roles, training several times, and training interprofessionally to enhance realism. Observing simulation training can be a valuable learning experience, but the students' preferred hands-on participation and learning by doing. For this reason, one can legitimise the observer role, given the large student groups and limited faculty time, as long as the students are also given some opportunity for hands-on participation in order to become more confident in their professional roles."
Developing a Conversational Virtual Standardized Patient to Enable Students to Practice History-Taking Skills,SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE-JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE,"Introduction: Although traditional virtual patient simulations are designed to teach and assess clinical reasoning skills, few employ conversational dialogue with the patients. The virtual standardized patients (VSPs) described herein represent standardized patients that students interview using natural language. Students take histories and develop differential diagnoses of the VSPs as much as they would with standardized or actual patients. The student-VSP interactions are recorded, creating a comprehensive record of questions and the order in which they were asked, which can be analyzed to assess information gathering skills. Students document the encounter in an electronic medical record created for the VSPs. Methods: The VSP was developed by integrating a dialogue management system (ChatScript) with emotionally responsive 3D characters created in a high-fidelity game engine (Unity). The system was tested with medical students at the Ohio State University College of Medicine. Students are able to take a history of a VSP, develop a differential diagnosis, and document the encounter in the electronic medical record. Results: Accuracy of the VSP responses ranged from 79% to 86%, depending on the complexity of the case, type of history obtained, and skill of the student. Students were able to accurately develop an appropriate differential diagnosis on the basis of the information provided by the patient during the encounter. Conclusions: The VSP enables students to practice their history-taking skills before encounters with standardized or actual patients. Future developments will focus on creating an assessment module that will automatically analyze VSP sessions and provide immediate student feedback."
SEMIQUANTITATIVE SIMULATION FOR REASONING ABOUT PHYSIOLOGICAL MODELS OF DRUG KINETICS AND EFFECTS,SCHWEIZERISCHE MEDIZINISCHE WOCHENSCHRIFT,
Improving the position of resuscitation team leader with simulation (IMPORTS); a pilot cross-sectional randomized intervention study,MEDICINE,"Background: Leadership and teamwork are important contributory factors in determining cardiac resuscitation performance and clinical outcome. We aimed to determine whether fixed positioning of the resuscitation team leader (RTL) relative to the patient influences leadership qualities during cardiac resuscitation using simulation. Methods: A cross-sectional randomized intervention study over 12 months' duration was conducted in university hospital simulation lab. ACLS-certified medical doctors were assigned to run 2 standardized simulated resuscitation code as RTL from a head-end position (HEP) and leg-end position (LEP). They were evaluated on leadership qualities including situational attentiveness (SA), errors detection (ED), and decision making (DM) using a standardized validated resuscitation-code-checklist (RCC). Performance was assessed live by 2 independent raters and was simultaneously recorded. RTL self-perceived performance was compared to measured performance. Results: Thirty-four participants completed the study. Mean marks for SA were 3.74 (SD +/- 0.96) at HEP and 3.54 (SD +/- 0.92) at LEP, P=.48. Mean marks for ED were 2.43 (SD +/- 1.24) at HEP and 2.21 (SD +/- 1.14) at LEP, P=.40. Mean marks for DM were 4.53 (SD +/- 0.98) at HEP and 4.47 (SD +/- 0.73) at LEP, P=.70. The mean total marks were 10.69 (SD +/- 1.82) versus 10.22 (SD +/- 1.93) at HEP and LEP respectively, P=.29 which shows no significance difference in all parameters. Twenty-four participants (71%) preferred LEP for the following reasons, better visualization (75% of participants); more room for movement (12.5% of participants); and better communication (12.5% of participants). RTL's perceived performance did not correlate with actual performance Conclusion: The physical position either HEP or LEP appears to have no influence on performance of RTL in simulated cardiac resuscitation. RTL should be aware of the advantages and limitations of each position."
Low Referral Pattern for Implantable Defibrillator Therapy in a Tertiary Hospital: Referral Physician Survey and Monte Carlo Simulation,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THERAPEUTICS,"Although implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy is the standard of care for prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD), its underutilization is a clinical concern. We performed a retrospective study on patients who underwent cardiac catheterization at a tertiary medical center to identify those who were eligible for ICD therapy as per the guidelines and those who actually received it as a part of treatment. Surprisingly, only 4.4% of eligible patients received ICD for SCD prevention. Assuming that the major cause of this underutilization of ICD therapy was low referral, we performed a structured survey among the referring physicians to assess specialists' availability, primary care physicians' role in ICD referral, patient management concerns, familiarity with ICD guidelines, and economics of ICD implantation. Physician response rate of the survey was 51% (35/68). Survey results showed that the common reasons for underreferral included nonavailability of electrophysiologists (34%), poor quality of life of patients (25.7%), patients not being on optimal therapy (25.7%), and low awareness (22.85%). Subsequently, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to assess a hypothetical survival of the study cohort, which showed that in an ideal scenario of ICD implantation, the mortality in the study cohort was decreased by 6.9% and 12.3% at 2- and 5-year follow-up, respectively. This study highlights the underutilization of ICDs and the referring physicians' approach to this therapy."
Experimental Simulation of Clinical Borderline Situations in Temporal Bone Specimens After Ossiculoplasty,EAR AND HEARING,"Objectives: One reason for insufficient hearing improvement with a distinct air-bone gap after ossiculoplasty with implantation of partial or total ossicular replacement prostheses can be the dislocation or minimal shifting of the prosthesis. The aim of this study was the simulation of common clinical borderline situations with minimal shifting of the prosthesis in temporal bone specimens after ossiculoplasty. It was furthermore the goal to identify these specific situations through imaging by cone beam computed tomography (cbCT) and direct visual inspection using the operation microscope. Additionally, the functional status was evaluated using laser-Doppler vibrometry (LDV). Design: We used a total of four temporal bone specimens for this study. A reconstruction with a partial ossicular replacement prostheses was performed in three specimens and with a total ossicular replacement prostheses in one specimen, with good initial acoustic properties. Subsequently, one specific type of prosthesis failure was simulated in each specimen, respectively, by minimally shifting, tilting, or bending the prostheses from their initial positions. These changes were introduced step-by-step until a borderline situation just short of complete acoustic decoupling was reached. Each step was examined using both LDV and cbCT and observed through the operation microscope. Results: LDV was able to quantify the mechanic function of the ossicular chain after most of the manipulation steps by demonstrating the effect of any shifting of the prosthesis on the middle ear transfer function. However, in some situations, the middle ear transfer function was better with a visually more advanced failure of the prosthesis. In addition, cbCT showed most of the steps with excellent resolution and was able to delineate changes in soft tissue (e.g., cartilage covering). Conclusion: cbCT seems to be a promising imaging technique for middle ear problems. As cbCT and LDV exhibited slightly different advantages and disadvantages regarding the demonstration of borderline situations, the combination of both techniques allowed for a more precise evaluation of middle ear reconstructions. Knowledge of the specific characteristics of these methods and their possible combination might help otologists and otosurgeons to refine indications for revision surgery and improve their personal patient counseling."
Influence of Selection Bias on the Test Decision A Simulation Study,METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE,"Background: Selection bias arises in clinical trials by reason of selective assignment of patients to treatment groups. Even in randomized clinical trials with allocation concealment this phenomenon can occur if future assignments can be predicted due to knowledge of former allocations. Objectives: Considering unmasked randomized clinical trials with allocation concealment the impact of selection bias on type I error rate under permuted block randomization is investigated. We aimed to extend the existing research into this topic by including practical assumptions concerning misclassification of patient characteristics to get an estimate of type I error close to clinical routine. To establish an upper bound for the type I error rate different biasing strategies of the investigator are compared first. In addition, the aspect of patient availability is considered. Methods: To evaluate the influence of selection bias on type I error rate under several practical situations, different block sizes, selection effects, biasing strategies and success rates of patient classification were simulated using SAS. Results: Type I error rate exceeds 5 percent significance level; it reaches values up to 21 percent. More cautious biasing strategies and misclassification of patient characteristics may diminish but cannot eliminate selection bias. The number of screened patients is about three times larger than the needed number for the trial. Conclusions: Even in unmasked randomized clinical trials using permuted block randomization with allocation concealment the influence of selection bias must not be disregarded evaluating the test decision. It should be incorporated when designing and reporting a clinical trial."
Potential impact of the validated Predicting Abusive Head Trauma (PredAHT) clinical prediction tool: A clinical vignette study,CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT,"Background: The validated Predicting Abusive Head Trauma (PredAHT) tool estimates the probability of abusive head trauma (AHT) in children < 3 years old with intracranial injury. Objective: To explore the impact of PredAHT on clinicians' AHT probability estimates and child protection (CP) actions, and assess inter-rater agreement between their estimates and between their CP actions, before and after PredAHT. Participants and Setting Twenty-nine clinicians from different specialties, at teaching and community hospitals. Methods: Clinicians estimated the probability of AHT and indicated their CP actions in six clinical vignettes. One vignette described a child with AHT, another described a child with non-AHT, and four represented gray cases, where the diagnosis was uncertain. Clinicians calculated the PredAHT score, and reported whether this altered their estimate/actions. The 'think-aloud' method was used to capture the reasoning behind their responses. Analysis included linear modelling, linear mixed-effects modelling, chi-square tests, Fisher's exact tests, intraclass correlation, Gwet's AC(1) coefficient and thematic analysis. Results: Overall, PredAHT significantly influenced clinicians' probability estimates in all vignettes (p < 0.001), although the impact on individual clinicians varied. However, the influence of PredAHT on clinicians' CP actions was limited; after using PredAHT, 9/29 clinicians changed their CP actions in only 11/174 instances. Clinicians' AHT probability estimates and CP actions varied somewhat both before and after PredAHT. Qualitative data suggested that PredAHT may increase clinicians' confidence in their decisions when considered alongside other associated clinical, historical and social factors. Conclusions: PredAHT significantly influenced clinicians' AHT probability estimates, but had minimal impact on their CP actions."
Searching the Clinical Fitness Landscape,PLOS ONE,"Widespread unexplained variations in clinical practices and patient outcomes suggest major opportunities for improving the quality and safety of medical care. However, there is little consensus regarding how to best identify and disseminate healthcare improvements and a dearth of theory to guide the debate. Many consider multicenter randomized controlled trials to be the gold standard of evidence-based medicine, although results are often inconclusive or may not be generally applicable due to differences in the contexts within which care is provided. Increasingly, others advocate the use quality improvement collaboratives, in which multi-institutional teams share information to identify potentially better practices that are subsequently evaluated in the local contexts of specific institutions, but there is concern that such collaborative learning approaches lack the statistical rigor of randomized trials. Using an agent-based model, we show how and why a collaborative learning approach almost invariably leads to greater improvements in expected patient outcomes than more traditional approaches in searching simulated clinical fitness landscapes. This is due to a combination of greater statistical power and more context-dependent evaluation of treatments, especially in complex terrains where some combinations of practices may interact in affecting outcomes. The results of our simulations are consistent with observed limitations of randomized controlled trials and provide important insights into probable reasons for effectiveness of quality improvement collaboratives in the complex socio-technical environments of healthcare institutions. Our approach illustrates how modeling the evolution of medical practice as search on a clinical fitness landscape can aid in identifying and understanding strategies for improving the quality and safety of medical care."
The simulated clinical environment: Cognitive and emotional impact among undergraduates,MEDICAL TEACHER,"Context: Simulated clinical immersion (SCI) is used in undergraduate healthcare programs to expose the learner to real-life situations in authentic simulated clinical environments. For novices, the environment in which the simulation occurs can be distracting and stressful, hence potentially compromising learning.Objectives: This study aims to determine whether SCI (with environment) imposes greater extraneous cognitive load and stress on undergraduate pharmacy students than simulated patients (SP) (without environment). It also aims to explore how features of the simulated environment influence students' perception of learning.Methods: In this mixed-methods study, 143 undergraduate pharmacy students experienced both SCI and SP in a crossover design. After the simulations, participants rated their cognitive load and emotions. Thirty-five students met in focus groups to explore their perception of learning in simulation.Results: Intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load and stress scores in SCI were significantly but modestly higher compared to SP. Qualitative findings reveal that the physical environment in SCI generated more stress and affected students? focus. In SP, students concentrated on clinical reasoning. SCI stimulated a focus on data collection but impeded in-depth problem solving processes.Conclusion: The physical environment in simulation influences what and how students learn. SCI was reported as more cognitively demanding than SP. Our findings emphasize the need for the development of adapted instructional design guidelines in simulation for novices."
Simulation-Based Event Analysis Improves Error Discovery and Generates Improved Strategies for Error Prevention,SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE-JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE,"Introduction An adverse event (AE) is a negative consequence of health care that results in unintended injury or illness. The study investigates whether simulation-based event analysis is different from traditional event analysis in uncovering root causes and generating recommendations when analyzing AEs in hospitalized children. Methods Two simulation scenarios were created based on real-life AEs identified through the hospital's Safety Reporting System. Scenario A involved an error of commission (inpatient drug error) and scenario B involved detecting an error that already occurred (drug infusion error). Each scenario was repeated 5 times with different, voluntary clinicians. Content analysis, using deductive and inductive approaches to coding, was used to analyze debriefing data. Causes and recommendations were compiled and compared with the traditional event analysis. Results Errors were reproduced in 60% (3/5) of scenario A. In scenario B, participants identified the error in 100% (5/5) of simulations (average time to error detection = 15 minutes). Debriefings identified reasons for errors including product labeling, memory aid interpretation, and lack of standard work for patient handover. To prevent error, participants suggested improved drug labeling, specialized drug kits, alert signs, and handoff checklists. Compared with traditional event analysis, simulation-based event analysis revealed unique causes for error and new recommendations. Conclusions Using simulation to analyze AEs increased unique error discovery and generated new recommendations. This method is different from traditional event analysis because of the immediate clinician debriefings in the clinical environment. Hospitals should consider simulation-based event analysis as an important addition to the traditional process."
Virtual Patient Simulations in Health Professions Education: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis by the Digital Health Education Collaboration,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,"Background: Virtual patients are interactive digital simulations of clinical scenarios for the purpose of health professions education. There is no current collated evidence on the effectiveness of this form of education. Objective: The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual patients compared with traditional education, blended with traditional education, compared with other types of digital education, and design variants of virtual patients in health professions education. The outcomes of interest were knowledge, skills, attitudes, and satisfaction. Methods: We performed a systematic review on the effectiveness of virtual patient simulations in pre- and postregistration health professions education following Cochrane methodology. We searched 7 databases from the year 1990 up to September 2018. No language restrictions were applied. We included randomized controlled trials and cluster randomized trials. We independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and then compared the information in pairs. We contacted study authors for additional information if necessary. All pooled analyses were based on random-effects models. Results: A total of 51 trials involving 4696 participants met our inclusion criteria. Furthermore, 25 studies compared virtual patients with traditional education, 11 studies investigated virtual patients as blended learning, 5 studies compared virtual patients with different forms of digital education, and 10 studies compared different design variants. The pooled analysis of studies comparing the effect of virtual patients to traditional education showed similar results for knowledge (standardized mean difference [SMD]=0.11, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.39, I-2=74%, n=927) and favored virtual patients for skills (SMD=0.90, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.32, I-2=88%, n=897). Studies measuring attitudes and satisfaction predominantly used surveys with item-by-item comparison. Trials comparing virtual patients with different forms of digital education and design variants were not numerous enough to give clear recommendations. Several methodological limitations in the included studies and heterogeneity contributed to a generally low quality of evidence. Conclusions: Low to modest and mixed evidence suggests that when compared with traditional education, virtual patients can more effectively improve skills, and at least as effectively improve knowledge. The skills that improved were clinical reasoning, procedural skills, and a mix of procedural and team skills. We found evidence of effectiveness in both high-income and low-and middle-income countries, demonstrating the global applicability of virtual patients. Further research should explore the utility of different design variants of virtual patients."
Orthopaedic education in the era of surgical simulation: Still at the crawling stage,WORLD JOURNAL OF ORTHOPEDICS,"Surgical skills education is in the process of a crucial transformation from a master-apprenticeship model to simulation-based training. Orthopaedic surgery is one of the surgical specialties where simulation-based skills training needs to be integrated into the curriculum efficiently and urgently. The reason for this strong and pressing need is that orthopaedic surgery covers broad human anatomy and pathologies and requires learning enormously diverse surgical procedures including basic and advanced skills. Although the need for a simulation-based curriculum in orthopaedic surgery is clear, several obstacles need to be overcome for a smooth transformation. The main issues to be addressed can be summarized as defining the skills and procedures so that simulation-based training will be most effective; choosing the right time period during the course of orthopaedic training for exposure to simulators; the right amount of such exposure; using objective, valid and reliable metrics to measure the impact of simulation-based training on the development and progress of surgical skills; and standardization of the simulation-based curriculum nationwide and internationally. In the new era of surgical education, successful integration of simulation-based surgical skills training into the orthopaedic curriculum will depend on efficacious solutions to these obstacles in moving forward."
Cortical thickness of superior frontal cortex predicts impulsiveness and perceptual reasoning in adolescence,MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY,"Impulsiveness is a pivotal personality trait representing a core domain in all major personality inventories. Recently, impulsiveness has been identified as an important modulator of cognitive processing, particularly in tasks that require the processing of large amounts of information. Although brain imaging studies have implicated the prefrontal cortex to be a common underlying representation of impulsiveness and related cognitive functioning, to date a fine-grain and detailed morphometric analysis has not been carried out. On the basis of ahigh-resolution magnetic resonance scans acquired in 1620 healthy adolescents (IMAGEN), the individual cortical thickness (CT) was estimated. Correlations between Cloninger's impulsiveness and CT were studied in an entire cortex analysis. The cluster identified was tested for associations with performance in perceptual reasoning tasks of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC IV). We observed a significant inverse correlation between trait impulsiveness and CT of the left superior frontal cortex (SFC; Monte Carlo Simulation P < 0.01). CT within this cluster correlated with perceptual reasoning scores (Bonferroni corrected) of the WISC IV. On the basis of a large sample of adolescents, we identified an extended area in the SFC as a correlate of impulsiveness, which appears to be in line with the trait character of this prominent personality facet. The association of SFC thickness with perceptual reasoning argues for a common neurobiological basis of personality and specific cognitive domains comprising attention, spatial reasoning and response selection. The results may facilitate the understanding of the role of impulsiveness in several psychiatric disorders associated with prefrontal dysfunctions and cognitive deficits.

Efficacy of virtual patients in medical education: A meta-analysis of randomized studies,COMPUTERS & EDUCATION,"A meta-analysis was performed to assess the Effect Size (ES) from randomized studies comparing the effect of educational interventions in which Virtual patients (VPs) were used either as an alternative method or additive to usual curriculum versus interventions based on more traditional methods. Meta-analysis was designed, conducted and reported according to QUORUM statement on quality of reporting of meta-analyses. Twelve randomized controlled studies were retrieved, assessing a total of 25 different outcomes. Under a random-effect model, meta-analysis showed a clear positive pooled overall effect for VPs compared to other educational methods (Odds Ratio: 239; 95% C.I. 1.48 divided by 3.84). A positive effect has been documented both when VPs have been used as an additive resource (O.R.: 2.55; C.I. 1.36 divided by 4.79) and when they have been compared as an alternative to a more traditional method (O.R.: 2.19; 1.06 divided by 4.52). When grouped for type of outcome, the pooled ES for studies addressing communication skills and ethical reasoning was lower than for clinical reasoning outcome. There is evidence that VPs are effective but further research is needed to clarify which is their best possible integration in curricula and their value and cost/benefit ratio with respect to other active learning methods.

A Simulation Based Model for Planning Operating Theater Activity in Complex Hospitals: Case Study in Orthopedics,"WORLD CONGRESS ON MEDICAL PHYSICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, 2015, VOLS 1 AND 2","Operating theaters (OT) in hospitals represent some of the highest sources of economic expenditures since their high complexity in terms of technology equipment (integration of different complex devices and specific technical requirements), organization (multi-personnel area with complex patients flow) and usage (optimum planning between regular activity and emergency management). For the above reasons, it is essential to understand and plan the whole surgical path (patient and personnel) by avoiding foreseeable inefficiencies, delays and risks. Hence, the aim of this study is fully modeling a generic orthopedics OT in order to support hospital decision makers in OT design and activity planning for both regular and emergency scenarios. In order to do that and due to the complexity of the OT system, a simulation approach is fundamental for properly understanding the whole process and for clearly controlling and analyzing all the factors involved (surgical durations, types, working times and rooms availability, etc..). Discrete event models have been found reliable and accurate to simulate complex health systems (e.g. emergency management, beds management, logistic and assets estimation, etc.). Finally, after selecting the most appropriate type of model, and using past surgical data and experts' opinions from the hospital for its development and implementation, a more precise and reliable clinical validation of the model is currently in progress, by concluding a data verification that needs a period of on-site data collection."
Transitioning Child Health Clinical Content From Direct Care to Online Instruction,JOURNAL OF NURSING EDUCATION,"Background: The global pandemic of 2020 forced prelicensure nursing degree programs to rapidly reevaluate clinical teaching methodologies. To maintain high educational standards with minimal anxiety and disruption for students, a child health teaching team developed an innovative revised plan for facilitation of clinical experiences within the virtual learning environment. Method: Experienced faculty employed a series of clinical learning activities in the online environment using existing virtual simulations, along with new innovations including a digital escape room, unfolding case studies, and blended prioritization simulations. Results: Information gleaned from student evaluations identified self-reported increases in clinical reasoning, prioritization, communication, and critical thinking skills. Students appreciated a more relaxed pace that allowed for more time to think through the processes. Conclusion: Virtual activities can be as effective as in-person clinical learning methodologies. Integrating virtual activities into clinical curricula can be a viable option, especially in areas where clinical placement is limited."
Differences in sympathetic and vagal effects on paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: a simulation study,BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY,"The incidence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) is affected by circadian variations in the vago-sympathetic balance. It is well known that both sympathetic and vagal effects increase the onset of paroxysmal AF, due to the shortened action potential duration. However, the reason why the vagally-mediated paroxysmal AF is maintained more than the adrenergically-mediated paroxysmal AF has remained unclear. In order to clarify this, we performed the following computer simulations. First, we constructed a homogeneous two-dimensional myocardial sheet (4.5 x 2.25 cm), using a bidomain ion channel model. The sympathetic and vagal effects were achieved by modifications of the ion channel conductance (Sympathetic effect: increased gSI and increased gK. Vagal effect: increased gK and increased gK1 with or without the dispersion of refractoriness). We found that the sympathetic effect shortened the action potential duration and flattened the restitution slope; therefore, this effect promoted spiral wave induction and restrained the spiral wave breakup. On the other hand, we found that the vagal effect also shortened the action potential duration and flattened the restitution slope; however, this effect promoted spiral wave breakup, due to the increase in both the IK1 and the dispersion of refractoriness. Overall, the differences between the sympathetic and vagal effects on the tendency toward spiral wave break-up may explain the reason why adrenergically-mediated paroxysmal AF terminates spontaneously and vagally-mediated paroxysmal AF tends to be maintained. In conclusion, our results may be helpful in understanding the difference in the action of sympathetic and vagal effects on paroxysmal AF. (C) 2002 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

Bayesian multiple imputation for missing multivariate longitudinal data from a Parkinson's disease clinical trial,STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH,"In Parkinson's disease (PD) clinical trials, Parkinson's disease is studied using multiple outcomes of various types (e.g. binary, ordinal, continuous) collected repeatedly over time. The overall treatment effects across all outcomes can be evaluated based on a global test statistic. However, missing data occur in outcomes for many reasons, e.g. dropout, death, etc., and need to be imputed in order to conduct an intent-to-treat analysis. We propose a Bayesian method based on item response theory to perform multiple imputation while accounting for multiple sources of correlation. Sensitivity analysis is performed under various scenarios. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed method outperforms standard methods such as last observation carried forward and separate random effects model for each outcome. Our method is motivated by and applied to a Parkinson's disease clinical trial. The proposed method can be broadly applied to longitudinal studies with multiple outcomes subject to missingness."
A qualitative study of postgraduate students' perceptions of virtual patients in emergency medicine tutorials,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Objectives: To investigate students' reactions to introducing virtual patients into a postgraduate emergency medicine curriculum. Methods: Qualitative data from semi-structured interviews were subjected to a thematic analysis. A convenient sample of seven postgraduate doctors in training enrolled in the diploma program participated in the study. Results: The results indicate that participants' reactions to including virtual patients in tutorials yielded six themes: (a) Virtual patients are game-informed learning; (b) A virtual patient tutorial is collaborative learning; (c) Virtual patient is an authentic activity; (d) Virtual patients encourage reflection; (e) Virtual patients encourage clinical reasoning; and (f) Integrate virtual patients into the curriculum. Conclusions: The implication of this study is that the virtual patient is a significant learning resource in postgraduate emergency medicine. Virtual patients may be used for independent study or collaborative learning. The virtual patient tutorial was a positive learning environment free of risk to patients in which learners practiced clinical reasoning. Virtual patients were authentic in context and culture, but their navigation needs improvement. Future work includes exploring alternative virtual patient designs and using virtual patients for assessment."
An Instrumented Glove to Assess Manual Dexterity in Simulation-Based Neurosurgical Education,SENSORS,"The traditional neurosurgical apprenticeship scheme includes the assessment of trainee's manual skills carried out by experienced surgeons. However, the introduction of surgical simulation technology presents a new paradigm where residents can refine surgical techniques on a simulator before putting them into practice in real patients. Unfortunately, in this new scheme, an experienced surgeon will not always be available to evaluate trainee's performance. For this reason, it is necessary to develop automatic mechanisms to estimate metrics for assessing manual dexterity in a quantitative way. Authors have proposed some hardware-software approaches to evaluate manual dexterity on surgical simulators. This paper presents IGlove, a wearable device that uses inertial sensors embedded on an elastic glove to capture hand movements. Metrics to assess manual dexterity are estimated from sensors signals using data processing and information analysis algorithms. It has been designed to be used with a neurosurgical simulator called Daubara NS Trainer, but can be easily adapted to another benchtop-and manikin-based medical simulators. The system was tested with a sample of 14 volunteers who performed a test that was designed to simultaneously evaluate their fine motor skills and the IGlove's functionalities. Metrics obtained by each of the participants are presented as results in this work; it is also shown how these metrics are used to automatically evaluate the level of manual dexterity of each volunteer."
Monte Carlo modeling of light propagation in the human head for applications in sinus imaging,JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS,"Sinus blockages are a common reason for physician visits, affecting one out of seven people in the United States, and often require medical treatment. Diagnosis in the primary care setting is challenging because symptom criteria (via detailed clinical history) plus objective imaging [computed tomography (CT) or endoscopy] are recommended. Unfortunately, neither option is routinely available in primary care. We previously demonstrated that low-cost near-infrared (NIR) transillumination correlates with the bulk findings of sinus opacity measured by CT. We have upgraded the technology, but questions of source optimization, anatomical influence, and detection limits remain. In order to begin addressing these questions, we have modeled NIR light propagation inside a three-dimensional adult human head constructed via CT images using a mesh-based Monte Carlo algorithm (MMCLAB). In this application, the sinus itself, which when healthy is a void region (e.g., nonscattering), is the region of interest. We characterize the changes in detected intensity due to clear (i.e., healthy) versus blocked sinuses and the effect of illumination patterns. We ran simulations for two clinical cases and compared simulations with measurements. The simulations presented herein serve as a proof of concept that this approach could be used to understand contrast mechanisms and limitations of NIR sinus imaging. (C) The Authors.

Simulation-based Remediation in Emergency Medicine Residency Training: A Consensus Study,WESTERN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE,"Introduction: Resident remediation is a pressing topic in emergency medicine (EM) training programs. Simulation has become a prominent educational tool in EM training and been recommended for identification of learning gaps and resident remediation. Despite the ubiquitous need for formalized remediation, there is a dearth of literature regarding best practices for simulation-based remediation (SBR). Methods: We conducted a literature search on SBR practices using the terms simulation, remediation, and simulation based remediation. We identified relevant themes and used them to develop an open-ended questionnaire that was distributed to EM programs with experience in SBR. Thematic analysis was performed on all subsequent responses and used to develop survey instruments, which were then used in a modified two-round Delphi panel to derive a set of consensus statements on the use of SBR from an aggregate of 41 experts in simulation and remediation in EM. Results: Faculty representing 30 programs across North America composed the consensus group with 66% of participants identifying themselves as simulation faculty, 32% as program directors, and 2% as core faculty. The results from our study highlight a strong agreement across many areas of SBR in EM training. SBR is appropriate for a range of deficits, including procedural, medical knowledge application, clinical reasoning/decision-making, communication, teamwork, and crisis resource management. Simulation can be used both diagnostically and therapeutically in remediation, although SBR should be part of a larger remediation plan constructed by the residency leadership team or a faculty expert in remediation, and not the only component. Although summative assessment can have a role in SBR, it needs to be very clearly delineated and transparent to everyone involved. Conclusion: Simulation may be used for remediation purposes for certain specific kinds of competencies as long as it is carried out in a transparent manner to all those involved."
The impact of surgical simulation on patient outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis,NEUROSURGICAL REVIEW,"The use of simulation in surgical training is ever growing. Evidence suggests such training may have beneficial clinically relevant effects. The objective of this research is to investigate the effects of surgical simulation training on clinically relevant patient outcomes by evaluating randomized controlled trials (RCT). PubMed was searched using PRISMA guidelines: surgery [All Fields] AND simulation [All Fields] AND patient outcome [All Fields]. Of 119 papers identified, 100 were excluded for various reasons. Meta-analyses were conducted using the inverse-variance random-effects method. Nineteen papers were reviewed using the CASP RCT Checklist. Sixteen studies looked at surgical training, two studies assessed patient-specific simulator practice, and one paper focused on warming-up on a simulator before performing surgery. Median study population size was 22 (range 3-73). Most articles reported outcome measures such as post-intervention Global Rating Scale (GRS) score and/or operative time. On average, the intervention group scored 0.42 (95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.71, P = 0.005) points higher on a standardized GRS scale of 1-10. On average, the intervention group was 44% (1% to 87%, P = 0.04) faster than the control group. Four papers assessed the impact of simulation training on patient outcomes, with only one finding a significant effect. We found a significant effect of simulation training on operative performance as assessed by GRS, albeit a small one, as well as a significant reduction to operative time. However, there is to date scant evidence from RCTs to suggest a significant effect of surgical simulation training on patient outcomes."
A systematic review of the reliability of objective structured clinical examination scores,MEDICAL EDUCATION,"CONTEXT The objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) is comprised of a series of simulations used to assess the skill of medical practitioners in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. It is often used in high-stakes examinations and therefore it is important to assess its reliability and validity. METHODS The published literature was searched (PsycINFO, PubMed) for OSCE reliability estimates (coefficient alpha and generalisability coefficients) computed either across stations or across items within stations. Coders independently recorded information about each study. A meta-analysis of the available literature was computed and sources of systematic variance in estimates were examined. RESULTS A total of 188 alpha values from 39 studies were coded. The overall (summary) alpha across stations was 0.66 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62-0.70); the overall alpha within stations across items was 0.78 (95% CI 0.73-0.82). Better than average reliability was associated with a greater number of stations and a higher number of examiners per station. Interpersonal skills were evaluated less reliably across stations and more reliably within stations compared with clinical skills. CONCLUSIONS Overall scores on the OSCE are often not very reliable. It is more difficult to reliably assess communication skills than clinical skills when considering both as general traits that should apply across situations. It is generally helpful to use two examiners and large numbers of stations, but some OSCEs appear more reliable than others for reasons that are not yet fully understood."
Optimizing clonidine dosage for sedation in mechanically ventilated children: A pharmacokinetic simulation study,PEDIATRIC ANESTHESIA,"Background Clonidine is in widespread off-label use as a sedative in mechanically ventilated children, despite limited evidence of efficacy. A variety of dosage regimens have been utilized in clinical practice and in research studies. Within these studies, clonidine has inconsistently shown useful sedation properties. One of the reasons attributed to the inconsistent signs of efficacy is suboptimal clonidine dosing. Aims This study aims to propose a target plasma concentration and simulate clonidine pharmacokinetics (PK) in a cohort of mechanically ventilated children to evaluate the adequacy of clonidine dosage regimens used in clinical practice and research studies. Methods A literature search was undertaken to identify a clonidine pharmaockinetic-pharmacodynamics (PKPD) model, from which a target concentration for sedation was defined. Using a previously published PK model, the projected plasma concentrations of 692 mechanically ventilated children (demographics taken from a recent study) were generated. Doses from recently published clinical studies were investigated. Adequacy of each regimen to attain therapeutic clonidine plasma concentrations was assessed. Results A target plasma concentration of above 2 mu g/L was proposed. Nine dosage regimens (four intravenous boluses, four intravenous infusions, and one nasogastric route boluses) were evaluated ranging from 1 mu g/kg eight hourly intravenous boluses to a regimen up to 3 mu g/kg/hr continuous intravenous infusion. Regimens with a loading dose of 2 mu g/kg followed by variable continuous infusion of up to 2 mu g/kg/hr titrated according to sedation score appear most suitable. Doses should be halved in neonates. Conclusion The variety of dosage regimens in the previous studies of clonidine along with difficulties in the conduct of interventional studies may have contributed to the lack of efficacy data to support its use. Simulations of clonidine plasma concentrations based on known population pharmacokinetic parameters suggest a loading dose followed by higher than current practice maintenance dose infusion is required to achieve adequate steady-state concentrations early in treatment. Further PKPD studies will aid in the determination of the optimal clonidine dosage regimen."
How to Use Information Technology to Improve Medication Safety,METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE,"The publication of a memorandum on improving medication safety by information technology in both the German journal GMS Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology (MIBE) and the journal Methods of Information in Medicine (MIM) gives reason to strengthen cooperation of MIBE and MIM and to report on more publications of MIBE here. The publications in focus deal with simulation-based optimization of emergency processes, handling of research data in publications, open access to research metadata, reliability of digital patient records in medical research, assessment methods for physical activity, using of insurance databases for epidemiological studies, certificates for epidemiological professionals, regression models, computer based training, and performance management in Swiss hospitals.

Economic Impact of Non-Medical Switching from Originator Biologics to Biosimilars: A Systematic Literature Review,ADVANCES IN THERAPY,"IntroductionA systematic literature review was conducted to review and summarize the economic impact of non-medical switching (NMS) from biologic originators to their biosimilars (i.e., switching a patient's medication for reasons irrelevant to the patient's health).MethodsEnglish publications reporting healthcare resource utilization (HRU) or costs associated with biosimilar NMS were searched in PubMed and EMBASE over the past 10years and from selected scientific conferences over the past 3years, along with gray literature for all biologics with an approved biosimilar (e.g., tumor-necrosis factor inhibitors, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, insulin and hormone therapies).ResultsA total of 1311 publications were retrieved, where 54 studies met the selection criteria. Seventeen studies reported increased real-world HRU or costs related to biosimilar NMS, e.g., higher rates of surgery (11%), steroid use (13%) and biosimilar dose escalating (6-35.4%). Among the studies that the estimated cost impact associated with NMS, 33 reported drug costs reduction, 12 reported healthcare costs post-NMS without a detailed breakdown, and 5 reported NMS setup and managing costs. Cost estimation/simulation studies demonstrated the cost reduction associated with NMS. However, variation across studies was substantial because of heterogeneity in study designs and assumptions (e.g., disease areas, scenarios of drug price discount rates, cost components, population size, study period, etc.).ConclusionReal-world studies reporting the economic impact of biosimilar NMS separately from drug costs are emerging, and those that reported such results found increased HRU in patients with biosimilar NMS. Studies of cost estimation have been largely limited to drug prices. Comprehensive evaluation of the economic impact of NMS should incorporate all important elements of healthcare service needs such as drug price, biologic rebates, HRU, NMS program setup, administration and monitoring costs.FundingAbbVie."
A Double Chaotic Layer Encryption Algorithm for Clinical Signals in Telemedicine,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS,"Recently, telemedicine offers medical services remotely via telecommunications systems and physiological monitoring devices. This scheme provides healthcare delivery services between physicians and patients conveniently, since some patients can not attend the hospital due to any reason. However, transmission of information over an insecure channel such as internet or private data storing generates a security problem. Therefore, authentication, confidentiality, and privacy are important challenges in telemedicine, where only authorized users should have access to medical or clinical records. On the other hand, chaotic systems have been implemented efficiently in cryptographic systems to provide confidential and privacy. In this work, we propose a novel symmetric encryption algorithm based on logistic map with double chaotic layer encryption (DCLE) in diffusion process and just one round of confusion-diffusion for the confidentiality and privacy of clinical information such as electrocardiograms (ECG), electroencephalograms (EEG), and blood pressure (BP) for applications in telemedicine. The clinical signals are acquired from PhysioBank data base for encryption proposes and analysis. In contrast with recent schemes in literature, we present a secure cryptographic algorithm based on chaos validated with the most complete security analysis until this time. In addition, the cryptograms are validated with the most complete pseudorandomness tests based on National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-22 suite. All results are at MATLAB simulations and all them show the effectiveness, security, robustness, and the potential use of the proposed scheme in telemedicine."
DO WE EVALUATE PROPERLY TO OUR MEDICAL SCHOOL STUDENTS?,"INTED2014: 8TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE","Introduction: Health education requires compilation of knowledge, skills, attitudes and values needed to train future professionals. It is necessary to establish an appropriate educational process based on skills and strategies for a further comprehensive assessment of the skills acquired. The Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) is a test designed to assess clinical competencies. The originality to change this evaluation method is to reflect the importance of learning what takes place during the assessment and not just only what students know that will be evaluated. The power of this test is due to the mix of assessment methods, so it is able to explore enough three of the four levels of the pyramid Miller: knowledge, know-how and show-how. The teacher can see the students interacting with patients to assess their clinical skills, thinking skills, problem solving skills, integrating diagnosis and communication and interpersonal skills, i.e., a comprehensive assessment which requires professionalism. Objectives: To launch a new competency evaluation methodology: the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) and compare the results with those obtained by the same students in a traditional evaluation short test and multiple choice questionnaires. Material and Methods: After carrying out a program of educational innovation in the Subject: Pediatrics Clinical Practice (structured clinical rotation, practical content in a virtual classroom and simulation seminars) a systematic review of competency assessment (OSCE) was performed. The design of the test was developed by the staging of a series of ten simulated clinical scenarios that reflects actual practice, presented serially in physical places called stations. In addition, a literature search and knowledge test were placed, in a multimedia classroom. The marks obtained by students in 6th year of the Faculty of Medicine of Valladolid in the course of Pediatrics, in consideration of skills (OSCE) and the traditional exam (with classical teaching methodology and assessment) were analyzed. We calculate the coefficient of intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to measure the agreement between two test results. Results: The mean total score obtained in the OSCE was 7.03 SD +/- 1.17 (range: 4.5 to 8.8). The average grade obtained in the classical examination was 7.55 points over 10 with SD +/- 1.53 (range: 3.79 to 9.26). The ICC for agreement between the two tests was 0.24 and the Pearson correlation coefficient was at a very low level, 0.34. This level of agreement could be considered irrelevant when we are comparing values in two tests that should at least theoretically give the same results. The average score for each of the stations with the rest of it, with the total score and the grades after the traditional exam was also correlated. OSCE stations evaluate grouped competences as it is showed at Figure 8. When analyzing the OSCE evaluation by groups of competences a strong correlation between the global results of OSCE and the groups of competences: case report (r 0,63) physical exploration (r 0,50),, technical abilities (0,43) and management (r 0,63) was observed. Conclusions: The use of objective structured clinical examination has been a great experience for both teachers and students. There isn't a strong relationship between the final marks obtained in the traditional part of the teaching and the final notes of the competence assessment, following a program of educational innovation, which leads us to think more comprehensively when assessing evaluation test to our students at different skills levels. Communication is a difficult competence to teach with traditional teaching methods. It is more an intrinsic characteristics of each individual; this is the reason why we think that it is not correlated with other type of competences."
Twelve tips to organise a mock OSCE,MEDICAL TEACHER,"The objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) is central to assessing clinical competence in undergraduate and postgraduate exams for medical and allied healthcare professions. A mock OSCE on the other hand is a simulation of the OSCE and a unique learning experience for the examinee. They benefit in a variety of ways; from enhancing their time management skills to receiving feedback that can improve their clinical skills. Unfortunately, opportunities to participate in simulated OSCEs remain limited. Reasons include difficulty in fulfilling organisational requirements and equipment-related costs. Mock OSCEs can be set up by undergraduate students or junior trainees for peers, without senior supervision or direct guidance. This article will discuss 12 tips regarding the arrangement of mock OSCEs to guide organisers, including accessing resources and establishing the content of the exam."
Success and Challenge When Returning to Clinical Practice: A Case Series in Anesthesiologist Re-Entry,ANESTHESIOLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE,"Introduction. Anesthesiologists returning to clinical practice pose unique challenges for licensing and credentialing boards. Few institutions provide re-education. We describe the physician refresher/re-entry program at our College of Medicine. Methods. We launched the physician re-entry program in 2006. This individualized program re-educates physicians who left clinical practice for any reason and are seeking to return. We report results achieved for 12 anesthesiologists who successfully completed the course between August 2012 and February 2018. Results. Seven men and five women left their practices for various reasons, which included relocation, family or medical reasons, substance use, and burnout. None left practice for medical negligence. Range away from clinical activity was 0-10 years. Five had active licenses. Seven were US graduates and five were international. Nine of 12 achieved their goals. Of the 3 others, 1 did not pursue her goal, another did not obtain a residency, and the other just finished the program. Seven out of 9 (78%) achieved their goal within 1 year of course completion. Discussion. Despite our small sample size, our experience to successfully return inactive physicians to the workforce adds to the scant literature and experience in refreshing inactive physicians. Our trainees return to practice serving communities across the country and are now a pivotal part of the anesthesiology workforce. Thus, this program not only services individual physicians, but the whole community affected by their absence."
Monte Carlo simulation of surveillance strategies for scrapie in Norwegian sheep,PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE,"Our aim was to compare the efficiency of different surveillance strategies for detecting scrapie-infected sheep flocks in the Norwegian population using simulation modelling. The dynamic Monte Carlo simulation model has the flock as the unit. The input parameters include properties of the sheep population (number of flocks, flock size, age distribution, reasons for culling, breeds, prion protein-allele distribution); properties of scrapie (genotype-dependent infection rate and incubation periods, and age- and genotype-dependent prevalence of scrapie); properties of the surveillance strategy (selection of sheep for examination, period in which infected sheep are detectable, and properties of the diagnostic tests). For simplification, the prion protein-alleles were grouped into three allele groups: VRQ, ARR, and ARQ' (ARQ' represents ARQ, ARH and AHQ). Through either abattoir surveillance or surveillance of fallen stock, less than or equal to9% of scrapie flocks were detected. The necessary sample size for detecting any particular number of scrapie flocks was considerably lower using surveillance of fallen stock than abattoir surveillance. After increasing the diagnostic method's sensitivity, only the efficiency of abattoir surveillance increased. The prion protein-genotypes ARQ'/ARQ', VRQ/ARQ' and VRQ/VRQ were overrepresented both in the sampled infected sheep and in the detected sheep. Sheep with ARQ'/ARQ' constituted >70% of the detected sheep (compared to 33% in the underlying population). The model output was sensitive to the susceptibility of infection for the genotype ARQ'/ARQ'. The effect was large for abattoir surveillance (increased susceptibility increased the efficiency of abattoir surveillance). (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Interaction of treatment with a continuous variable: simulation study of significance level for several methods of analysis,STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,"Interactions between treatments and covariates in RCTs are a key topic. Standard methods for modelling treatment-covariate interactions with continuous covariates are categorisation or linear functions. Both approaches are easily criticised, but for different reasons. Multivariable fractional polynomial interactions, an approach based on fractional polynomials with the linear interaction model as the simplest special case, was proposed. Four variants of multivariable fractional polynomial interaction (FLEX1-FLEX4), allowing varying flexibility in functional form, were suggested. However, their properties are unknown, and comparisons with other procedures are unavailable. Additionally, we consider various methods based on categorisation and on cubic regression splines. We present the results of a simulation study to determine the significance level (probability of a type 1 error) of various tests for interaction between a binary covariate ('treatment effect') and a continuous covariate in univariate analysis. We consider a simplified setting in which the response variable is conditionally normally distributed, given the continuous covariate. We consider two main cases with the covariate distribution well behaved (approximately symmetric) or badly behaved (positively skewed). We construct nine scenarios with different functional forms for the main effect. In the well-behaved case, significance levels are in general acceptably close to nominal and are slightly better for the larger sample size (n = 250 and 500 were investigated). In the badly behaved case, departures from nominal are more pronounced for several approaches. For a final assessment of these results and recommendations for practice, a study of power is needed.

Errors in after-hours phone consultations: a simulation study,BMJ QUALITY & SAFETY,"Background After-hours out-of-hospital phone consultations require physicians to make decisions based on information provided by a nurse over the phone. Methods We conducted a simulation study to evaluate physicians' actions following communication of key information. 22 nurses were asked to call physicians with six cases based on the six most common reasons for after-hours phone calls. We evaluated physicians' actions following the communication of key clinical information: A situation cue described a patient's problem (eg, confusion). A background cue described a specific clinical finding regarding the cause of the problem (eg, patient's sodium is low). For each cue we defined a list of indicators, based on the medical literature, to ascertain whether physicians acted upon the provided information (which was defined as addressing at least one of the indicators). Results A total of 108 phone consultations (containing 88 situation and 93 background cues) were analysed. Situation cues were communicated in 90% (79/88) of the calls and background cues in 33% (31/93). Physician acted upon the provided information in 57% (45/79) and 48% (15/31) of the communicated situation and background cues, respectively. When the background cues were not communicated, physicians asked questions expected to elicit the cue in 12% of the cases. Responding to the situation cue was associated with longer conversations and active inquiry by the physician. Conclusions After-hours phone calls are error prone. Both nurse communication and physician decision-making are problematic. Efforts to improve patient safety in this setting must address both communication and decision-making."
"Comparing Effectiveness of 3 Learning Strategies Simulation-Based Learning, Problem-Based Learning, and Standardized Patients",SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE-JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE,"Introduction: Curricula must not only provide students with knowledge but also foster the development of critical thinking and reasoning skills. Several learning strategies, including problem-based learning (PBL), standardized patients, and high-fidelity human simulation, have been incorporated into courses; however, it is currently unknown which technique is the most effective. Methods: This is a prospective, randomized, crossover study that was conducted during two 90-minute seizure disorder laboratory sessions for PharmD students in their third professional year. Students rotated between 3 different seizure disorder cases (A, B, and C), with each student experiencing 3 learning strategies including PBL, standardized patients, and high-fidelity human simulation. Evaluation of knowledge consisted of quizzes at the end of each case, and student perception and satisfaction were evaluated by an anonymous survey at the conclusion of the laboratory sessions. Results: Student quiz scores from the simulation learning strategy were statistically better than those from the standardized interview and modified PBL (mPBL) strategies in cases A and B (P < 0.001). The student quiz scores for the standardized interview were also statistically better than the mPBL scores in case C (P = 0.001). When surveyed, 91% of students agreed or strongly agreed that simulation improved their knowledge, whereas only 69% and 67% of students agreed or strongly agreed that mPBL or standardized patients, respectively, improved their knowledge (P < 0.001). Conclusions: High-fidelity simulation is an effective learning strategy. When it is compared with standardized patients and mPBL strategies, students performed better on knowledge-based quizzes and had higher levels of satisfaction. (Sim Healthcare 7:141-146, 2012)"
A Bayesian analysis of a mastitis control plan to investigate the influence of veterinary beliefs on clinical decisions,MASTITIS CONTROL: FROM SCIENCE TO PRACTICE,"A fundamental reason to evaluate animal health data is to determine whether changes should be made to clinical decisions. However, decisions made by veterinarians in the light of new research are known to be influenced by their original (prior) beliefs. In this research, clinical trial results for a bovine mastitis control plan were evaluated within a Bayesian context, to incorporate a community of prior distributions that represented a spectrum of clinical beliefs. The aim was to quantify differences in interpretation likely to be made by veterinarians with different initial viewpoints given the trial results. A Bayesian analysis was conducted using Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures. Stochastic models included a financial cost attributed to a change in mastitis following implementation of the control plan. Prior distributions covered a realistic range of clinical viewpoints, including scepticism, enthusiasm and uncertainty in the efficacy of the control plan. Results revealed dramatic differences in the financial gain that clinicians with different starting viewpoints would expect from the mastitis control plan, given the actual research results; e.g. a severe sceptic would expect a return of <5 pound per cow in an average herd that implemented the plan, whereas an enthusiast would expect >20 pound per cow. Simulations using theoretical future trials indicated that after three further equivalent studies, an initial sceptic would still expect substantially less return from the control plan than an initial enthusiast would expect after the first trial. In conclusion, it is possible to quantify how clinicians' prior beliefs influence the interpretation of research and therefore their likely approach to mastitis control."
CEFOTAXIME DOSAGE IN INFANTS AND CHILDREN - PHARMACOKINETIC AND CLINICAL RATIONALE FOR AN EXTENDED DOSAGE INTERVAL,CLINICAL PHARMACOKINETICS,"Cefotaxime is a third generation cephalosporin antimicrobial agent which has received wide acceptance as a first-line antibiotic for many infections in neonates, infants and children. With an average elimination half-life of about 1 h, cefotaxime is not considered to be a 'long half-life cephalosporin' like ceftriaxone. For this reason, currently accepted dosage regimens for cefotaxime in infants and children employ a dosage of 50 mg/kg every 6h. Re-examination of the paediatric pharmacokinetic data for cefotaxime and use of simple multiple-dose pharmacokinetic simulation of alternative dosage regimens was performed. From this analysis, regimens administering 75 mg/kg of the drug every 8h or every 12h were projected to produce serum cefotaxime concentrations adequate to effectively kill many of the common pathogens against which the drug is currently indicated for use in children. The clinical utility of these alternative dosage regimens was supported by a review of the medical literature and examination of the clinical results from studies in neonates, infants and children where cefotaxime was administered in 2 to 3 divided doses daily. It would appear, therefore, that increasing the cefotaxime dosage to 75 mg/kg administered at 8h intervals would result in less frequent drug administration which would not be expected to compromise safety and efficacy. Alternative dosage regimens for cefotaxime merit further consideration and clinical evaluation before they become commonly used in paediatric therapeutics."
"Investigating the Binding Mode of Reversible LSD1 Inhibitors Derived from Stilbene Derivatives by 3D-QSAR, Molecular Docking, and Molecular Dynamics Simulation",MOLECULES,"Overexpression of lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) has been found in many cancers. New anticancer drugs targeting LSD1 have been designed. The research on irreversible LSD1 inhibitors has entered the clinical stage, while the research on reversible LSD1 inhibitors has progressed slowly so far. In this study, 41 stilbene derivatives were studied as reversible inhibitors by three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR). Comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA q(2) = 0.623, r(2) = 0.987, r(pred)(2) = 0.857) and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA q(2) = 0.728, r(2) = 0.960, r(pred)(2) = 0.899) were used to establish the model, and the structure-activity relationship of the compounds was explained by the contour maps. The binding site was predicted by two different kinds of software, and the binding modes of the compounds were further explored. A series of key amino acids Val288, Ser289, Gly314, Thr624, Lys661 were found to play a key role in the activity of the compounds. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out for compounds 04, 17, 21, and 35, which had different activities. The reasons for the activity differences were explained by the interaction between compounds and LSD1. The binding free energy was calculated by molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA). We hope that this research will provide valuable information for the design of new reversible LSD1 inhibitors in the future."
"Evaluation of a telemedicine-based training for final-year medical students including simulated patient consultations, documentation, and case presentation",GMS JOURNAL FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background: Focused history taking, knowledge-based clinical reasoning, and adequate case presentation during hand-offs represent important facets of competence of practicing physicians. Based on a validated 360-degree assessment simulating a first day of residency we developed a training for final-year medical students including patient consultation, patient management, and patient hand-off. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the training was changed to a telemedicine format and evaluated. Methods: In 2019, 103 final-year students participated in a newly designed competence-based training including a consultation hour with simulated patients, a patient management phase with an electronic patient chart, and a case presentation in hand-off format. Due to social distancing regulations, the training was not allowed to take place in this way. Therefore, we changed the training to a telemedicine format. In May 2020, 32 students participated in the telemedicine training. A 5-point Likert scale (1: does not apply to 5: fully applies) was used for the evaluation items. The two formats were compared with t-tests. Results: The students were similarly satisfied with the content of the training independently of its format. Both groups found the patient cases interesting (presence: 4.68 +/- 0.49, telemedicine: 4.66 +/- 0.48). With respect to the telemedicine format, participants were glad that an option had been found that could be offered throughout the final year (4.94 +/- 0.24) despite the COVID-19 pandemic and they regarded it as a very useful training for their final examination (4.94 +/- 0.24). Conclusion: The telemedicine format of the competence-based training worked as well as the presence format. In its telemedicine format, the training can be offered to students independently of their location."
Loads on the prosthesis-socket interface of above-knee amputees during normal gait: Validation of a multi-body simulation,JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS,"The treatment of above-knee amputees with a prosthesis based on a socket is currently considered the standard clinical treatment. Nevertheless there are few investigations on mechanical loading conditions on these devices under realistic circumstances. Further insight in this matter might improve the design of sockets for everyday application. The presented study investigates the loads acting on the socket-interface with a multi-body simulation (MBS). Aim of this study is to validate the quality of the applied MBS next to a direct measurement device. Therefore a custom strain gauge based force-moment sensor is integrated into the conventional socket-based prosthesis of six above-knee amputees. Each subject performs level-walking with kinematic and kinetic data being recorded in a gait laboratory. The data of the marker trajectories is processed in an inverse dynamics MBS where loads at the location of the sensor are determined. The comparison of both methods shows a good agreement of forces and moments and the simulation can be considered fully validated. RMSD is 4.7%BW for the forces and 27.0%BWM for the moments. The model will be used in further research to determine loads on the socket-prosthesis interface of above-knee amputees especially in high risk situations such as falling scenarios, where direct measurement with amputees is not possible for ethical reasons.

COMBINING PHYSIOLOGICAL MODELS AND SYMBOLIC METHODS TO INTERPRET TIME-VARYING PATIENT DATA,METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE,"This paper describes a methodology for representing and using medical knowledge about temporal relationships to infer the presence of clinical events that evolve over time. The methodology consists of three steps: (1) the incorporation of patient observations into a generic physiologic model, (2) the conversion of model states and predictions into domain-specific temporal abstractions, and (3) the transformation of temporal abstractions into clinically meaningful descriptive text. The first step converts raw observations to underlying model concepts, the second step identifies temporal features of the fitted model that have clinical interest, and the third step replaces features represented by model parameters and predictions into concepts expressed in clinical language. We describe a program, called TOPAZ, that uses this three-step methodology. TOPAZ generates a narrative summary of the temporal events found in the electronic medical record of patients receiving cancer chemotherapy. A unique feature of TOPAZ is its use of numeric and symbolic techniques to perform different temporal reasoning tasks. Time is represented both as a continuous process and as a set of temporal intervals. These two temporal models differ in the temporal ontology they assume and in the temporal concepts they encode. Without multiple temporal models, this diversity of temporal knowledge could not be represented."
Evaluation of Fundamental Forensic Knowledge and Perceived Ability in Emergency Nurse Practitioner Education via Forensic Simulation,JOURNAL OF FORENSIC NURSING,"Introduction The need for trauma care and forensic services is among the top five reasons for seeking healthcare in the United States. Critical aspects of caring for a forensic patient include early recognition of the need for implementing forensic approaches to care: assessment, evidence collection and preservation, and forensic documentation. The intent of this study was to examine fundamental forensic knowledge and perceived ability of graduate-level emergency nurse practitioner students. Methods The study was designed to assess fundamental forensic knowledge of graduate-level emergency nurse practitioners using a pretest-and-posttest prospective design utilizing simulation. Results Students showed an increase in their knowledge of forensic nursing concepts from pretest to posttest (t(39) = 9.63, p < 0.001). In addition, there was an increase in students' perceived ability (confidence) to recognize the forensic aspects of patient care. Two unexpected findings were revealed during debriefing. Although the students were interested in gaining forensic knowledge, they felt it was more important to know when to refer a patient rather than to gain the requisite knowledge to perform forensic functions on their own. Furthermore, students developed an awareness of how their previous clinical experiences influenced their care. Conclusion Findings from this study will inform further development of graduate-level nursing education to include forensic and multidisciplinary simulation exercises."
Evidence of virtual patients as a facilitative learning tool on an anesthesia course,ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION,"Virtual patients are computerised representations of realistic clinical cases. They were developed to teach clinical reasoning skills through delivery of multiple standardized patient cases. The anesthesia course at The Chinese University of Hong Kong developed two novel types of virtual patients, formative assessment cases studies and storyline, to teach its final year medical students on a 2 week rotational course. Acute pain management cases were used to test if these two types of virtual patient could enhance student learning. A 2 x 2 cross over study was performed in academic year 2010-2011 on 130 students divided into four groups of 32-34. Performance was evaluated by acute pain management items set within three examinations; an end of module 60-item multiple choice paper, a short answer modified essay paper and the end of year final surgery modified essay paper. The pain management case studies were found to enhanced student performance in all three examinations, whilst the storyline virtual patient had no demonstrable effect. Student-teaching evaluation questionnaires showed that the case studies were favored more than the storyline virtual patient. Login times showed that students on average logged onto the case studies for 6 h, whereas only half the students logged on and used the storyline virtual patient. Formative assessment case studies were well liked by the students and reinforced learning of clinical algorithms through repetition and feedback, whereas the educational role of the more narrative and less interactive storyline virtual patient was less clear ."
Exploring the effect of inhibitor AKB-9778 on VE-PTP by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation,JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY,"Diabetic macular edema, also known as diabetic eye disease, is mainly caused by the overexpression of vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP) at hypoxia/ischemic. AKB-9778 is a known VE-PTP inhibitor that can effectively interact with the active site of VE-PTP to inhibit the activity of VE-PTP. However, the binding pattern of VE-PTP with AKB-9778 and the dynamic implications of AKB-9778 on VE-PTP system at the molecular level are poorly understood. Through molecular docking, it was found that the AKB-9778 was docked well in the binding pocket of VE-PTP by the interactions of hydrogen bond and Van der Waals. Furthermore, after molecular dynamic simulations on VE-PTP system and VE-PTPAKB-9778 system, a series of postdynamic analyses found that the flexibility and conformation of the active site undergone an obvious transition after VE-PTP binding with AKB-9778. Moreover, by constructing the RIN, it was found that the different interactions in the active site were the detailed reasons for the conformational differences between these two systems. Thus, the finding here might provide a deeper understanding of AKB-9778 as VE-PTP Inhibitor."
"Perspective: The Negativity Bias, Medical Education, and the Culture of Academic Medicine: Why Culture Change Is Hard",ACADEMIC MEDICINE,"Despite ongoing efforts to improve working conditions, address wellbeing of faculty and students, and promote professionalism, many still feel the culture of academic medicine is problematic. Depression and burnout persist among physicians and trainees. The authors propose that culture change is so challenging in part because of an evolutionary construct known as the negativity bias that is reinforced serially in medical education. The negativity bias drives people to attend to and be more greatly affected by the negative aspects of experience. Some common teaching methods such as simulations, pimping, and instruction in clinical reasoning inadvertently reinforce the negativity bias and thereby enhance physicians' focus on the negative. Here, the authors examine the concept of negativity bias in the context of academic medicine, arguing that culture is affected by serially emphasizing the inherent bias to recognize and remember the negative. They explore the potential role of practices rooted in positive psychology as powerful tools to counteract the negativity bias and aid in achieving desired culture change."
Resident competencies before and after short intensive care unit rotations: a multicentre pilot observational study,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA-JOURNAL CANADIEN D ANESTHESIE,"Purpose Residency programs need to understand the competencies developed by residents during an intensive care unit (ICU) rotation, so that curricula and assessments maximize residents' learning. The primary study objective was to evaluate the feasibility for training programs and acceptability by residents of conducting a multi-competency assessment during a four-week ICU rotation. Methods We conducted a prospective, multicentre observational pilot study in three ICUs. During weeks 1 and 4 of an ICU rotation, we conducted repeated standardized assessments of non-critical care specialty residents' competencies in cognitive reasoning (script concordance test [SCT]), procedural skills (objective structured assessment of technical skills [OSATS]-global rating scale], and communication skills through a written test, two procedural simulations, and a simulated encounter with a family member. The feasibility outcomes included program costs, the proportion of enrolled residents able to complete at least one three-station assessment during their four-week ICU rotation, and acceptability of the assessment for the trainees. Results We enrolled 63 (69%) of 91 eligible residents, with 58 (92%) completing at least one assessment. The total cost to conduct 90 assessments was CAD 33,800. The majority of participants agreed that the assessment was fair and that it measured important clinical abilities. For the 32 residents who completed two assessments, the mean (standard deviation) cognitive reasoning and procedural skill scores increased between weeks 1 and 4 [SCT difference, 3.1 (6.5), P = 0.01; OSATS difference for bag-mask ventilation and central line insertion, 0.4 (0.5) and 0.6 (0.8), respectively; both P <= 0.001]. Nevertheless, the communication scores did not change significantly. Conclusions A monthly multi-competency assessment for specialty residents rotating in the ICU is likely feasible for most programs with appropriate resources, and generally acceptable for residents. Specialty residents' cognitive reasoning and procedural skills may improve during a four-week ICU rotation, whereas communication skills may not."
The lifetime cost of current human immunodeficiency virus care in the United States,MEDICAL CARE,"Objective: We sought to project the lifetime cost of medical care for human immunodefiency virus (HIV)-infected adults using current antiretroviral therapy (ART) standards. Methods: Medical visits and hospitalizations for any reason were from the HIV Research Network, a consortium of high-volume HIV primary care sites. HIV treatment drug regimen efficacies were from clinical guidelines and published sources; data on other drugs used were not available. In a computer simulation model, we projected HIV medical care costs in 2004 U.S. dollars. Results: From the time of entering HIV care, per person projected life expectancy is 24.2 years, discounted lifetime cost is $385,200, and undiscounted cost is $618,900 for adults who initiate ART with CD4 cell count < 350/mu L. Seventy-three percent of the cost is antiretroviral medications, 13% inpatient care, 9% outpatient care, and 5% other HIV-related medications and laboratory costs. For patients who initiate ART with CD4 cell count < 200/mu L, projected life expectancy is 22.5 years, discounted lifetime cost is $354,100 and undiscounted cost is $567,000. Results are sensitive to drug manufacturers' discounts, ART efficacy, and use of enfavirtide for salvage. If costs are discounted to the time of infection, the discounted lifetime cost is $303,100. Conclusions: Effective ART regimens have substantially improved survival and have increased the lifetime cost of HIV-related medical care in the U.S."
A poor metabolizer of both CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 identified by mechanistic pharmacokinetic simulation in a fatal drug poisoning case involving venlafaxine,FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL,"We present a fatal drug poisoning case involving venlafaxine (VEN). The deceased took his medication regularly (including 150 mg VEN twice daily), and nothing in the case or autopsy findings pointed towards suicide. The toxicological assessment concluded that the cause of death was most likely due to a poisoning with a combination of VEN, oxycodone and ethanol, and the manner of death was considered to be an accident. The blood concentration of VEN was high (4.5 mg/kg), and the ratio of the VEN metabolite O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) to VEN was exceptionally low (0.006). Mechanistic pharmacokinetic simulations suggested that the low metabolite ratio was the result of combined poor metabolizer (PM) status of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 and CYP2D6. This hypothesis was confirmed by genetic analysis. Simulations revealed that it was likely that the combined missing CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 activity would cause higher concentrations of VEN, but the simulations also suggested that there could be additional reasons to explain the high VEN concentration found in this case. Thus, it seems likely that the potentially toxic VEN concentration was caused by reduced metabolic capacity. The simulations combined with genotyping were considered very useful in this fatal drug poisoning case. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
The cost of generic clinical mastitis in dairy cows as estimated by using dynamic programming,JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE,"The objective of this study was to estimate the cost of generic clinical mastitis (CM) in high-yielding dairy cows given optimal decisions concerning handling of CM cases. A specially structured optimization and simulation model that included a detailed representation of repeated episodes of CM was used to study the effects of various factors on the cost of CM. The basic scenario was based on data from 5 large herds in New York State. In the basic scenario, 92% of the CM cases were recommended to be treated. The average cost of CM per cow and year in these herds was $ 71. The average cost of a CM case was $ 179. It was composed of $ 115 because of milk yield losses, $ 14 because of increased mortality, and $ 50 because of treatment-associated costs. The estimated cost of CM was highly dependent on cow traits: it was highest ($ 403) in cows with high expected future net returns (e.g., young, high-milk-yielding cows), and was lowest ($ 3) in cows that were recommended to be culled for reasons other than mastitis. The cost per case of CM was 18% higher with a 20% increase in milk price and 17% lower with a 20% decrease in milk price. The cost per case of CM was affected little by a 20% change in replacement cost or pregnancy rate. Changes in CM incidence, however, resulted from changes in these factors, thus affecting whole-farm profitability. The detailed results obtained from this insemination and replacement optimization model can assist farmers in making CM treatment decisions."
Editorial Commentary: Proficiency-Based Progression Surgical Simulation Training Is an Efficient Adjunct to High-Volume Clinical Experience,ARTHROSCOPY-THE JOURNAL OF ARTHROSCOPIC AND RELATED SURGERY,"The optimal way to train a future surgeon has been debated for years, with strategies ranging from the wellknown see one, do one, teach one approach to more novel approaches that rely on metrics and proficiency. Recent research shows that surgical training with a proficiency-based progression curriculum is an efficient strategy for teaching arthroscopy procedural skills, and, further, may improve patient safety by reducing the technical errors that might otherwise occur before proficiency is achieved. While every surgical specialty has its nuances that must be mastered to provide safe, effective, and efficient care, for a variety of reasons, the skills needed to perform arthroscopy are incredibly difficult to learn, let alone achieve proficiency or master. On-the-job training for orthopaedic residents has become more difficult in today's fast-paced, work hourelimited, volume-rewarded society. Proficiency-based progression is a piece of the puzzle, but for now, it is not a complete substitute for high-volume, clinical experience and exposure to the countless variables that may affect a real-life surgical procedure."
Professional practice assessment for minor head injury management in emergency department and clinical impact of a simulation-based training: Interventional study (before/after),ULUSAL TRAVMA VE ACIL CERRAHI DERGISI-TURKISH JOURNAL OF TRAUMA & EMERGENCY SURGERY,"BACKGROUND: Minor head injury is a frequent reason for consultation in the emergency department. The use of computed tomography (CT) has increased dramatically in patients' care. Good time management implementation and interpretation are required. To study the level of agreement with recommendations for a minor head injury in emergency department management and the impacts of simulation-based training (SBT) on professional practice changes. METHODS: Evaluation of professional practice for patient care in an emergency department according to the recommendations of the French Emergency Medicine Society (SFMU) established in 2012 before and after an SBT, including theoretical and simulation courses. It was based on the analysis of time to carry out a CT scan. It was also based on analysis of adherence to brain and spine scan indications and to hospitalization criteria. RESULTS: The SBT carried out in the evaluation of the professional practices makes it possible to acquire the notion of urgency to obtain the CT Scan within one hour when the criteria are met (p=0.007). Rater reliability for agreement with the hospitalization recommendations was better after SBT (p=0.03, increased Kappa from 0.73 to 0.93). On the other hand, there appeared to be a lack of essential information in the medical file, such as time of onset of head trauma. CONCLUSION: Management of this type of patient appeared to be satisfactory. It can be improved by SBT on the basis of the SFMU 2012 consensus conference. There is a need to improve the software used by the emergency departments, which should include the time of trauma and recommendations. The association of the clinic and the biomarkers could help to limit the indications of the CT scan, and thus to have it organized more rapidly."
Procedural training models among emergency medicine residency programs,CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL EMERGENCY MEDICINE,"Objective Optimal training methods remain controversial for rarely performed emergency procedures. Previous research has failed to demonstrate the superiority or inferiority of live anesthetized animal models (LAA) as compared to other modalities. Most of the data on LAA use comes from military contexts; less information is available for civilian emergency medicine (EM) training. We sought to characterize the prevalence of LAA use among civilian EM residency programs and reasons for its use or discontinuation. Methods Survey study of program directors of EM residency programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. A 16-item questionnaire was electronically delivered to program directors, including program region, current and historical use of LAA, and attitudes regarding the optimal procedural training modalities. Results Of 179 survey recipients, 83 completed the survey (46.4%). Twelve programs (14.3%) currently use LAA, and 17 programs (20.5%) report previous LAA use. Reasons for discontinuing LAA use included ethical concerns, financial and logistical limitations, political pressures, and feeling that there were superior or equivalent alternative models available. Programs that currently use LAA were more likely to rank LAA as being the most preferable training modality while programs that do not currently use LAA were more likely to rank human cadavers as the most preferable modality. Conclusion Despite a lack of data showing educational outcomes-driven differences between LAA and alternative training models, LAA use is declining among civilian EM residencies. Despite this, disagreement exists among programs that do and do not use LAA regarding the most optimal procedural training."
Knowing How and Knowing Why: testing the effect of instruction designed for cognitive integration on procedural skills transfer,ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION,"Transfer is a desired outcome of simulation-based training, yet evidence for how instructional design features promote transfer is lacking. In clinical reasoning, transfer is improved when trainees experience instruction integrating basic science explanations with clinical signs and symptoms. To test whether integrated instruction has similar effects in procedural skills (i.e., psychomotor skills) training, we studied the impact of instruction that integrates conceptual (why) and procedural (how) knowledge on the retention and transfer of simulation-based lumbar puncture (LP) skill. Medical students (N = 30) were randomized into two groups that accessed different instructional videos during a 60-min self-regulated training session. An unintegrated video provided procedural How instruction via step-by-step demonstrations of LP, and an integrated video provided the same How instruction with integrated conceptual Why explanations (e.g., anatomy) for key steps. Two blinded raters scored post-test, retention, and transfer performances using a global rating scale. Participants also completed written procedural and conceptual knowledge tests. We used simple mediation regression analyses to assess the total and indirect effects (mediated by conceptual knowledge) of integrated instruction on retention and transfer. Integrated instruction was associated with improved conceptual (p < .001) but not procedural knowledge test scores (p = .11). We found no total effect of group (p > .05). We did find a positive indirect group effect on skill retention (B (ab) = .93, p < .05) and transfer (B (ab) = .59, p < .05), mediated through participants improved conceptual knowledge. Integrated instruction may improve trainees' skill retention and transfer through gains in conceptual knowledge. Such integrated instruction may be an instructional design feature for simulation-based training aimed at improving transfer outcomes."
A Cloud Based Solution for Collaborative and Secure Sharing of Medical Data,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SYSTEMS,"Healthcare sector is under pressure to reduce costs while delivering high quality of care services. This situation requires that clinical staff, equipment and IT tools to be used more equitably, judiciously and efficiently. In this sense, collaborative systems have the ability to provide opportunities for healthcare organizations to share resources and create a collaborative working environment. The lack of interoperability between dissimilar systems and operating costs are the major obstacle to the implementation of this concept. Fortunately, cloud computing has great potential for addressing interoperability issues and significantly reducing operating costs. Since the laws and regulations prohibit the disclosure of health information, it is necessary to carry out a comprehensive study on security and privacy issues in cloud computing. Based on their analysis of these constraints, the authors propose a simple and efficient method that enables secure collaboration between healthcare institutions. For this reason, they propose Secure Multi-party Computation (SMC) protocols to ensure compliance with data protection legislation. Specifically, the authors use Paillier scheme to protect medical data against unauthorized usage when outsourcing computations to a public cloud. Another useful feature of this algorithm is the possibility to perform arithmetic operations over encrypted data without access to the original data. In fact, the Paillier algorithm is an efficient homomorphic encryption that supports addition operations on ciphertexts. Based on the simulation results, the proposed framework helps healthcare organizations to successfully evaluate a public function directly on encrypted data without revealing their private inputs. Consequently, the proposed collaborative application ensures privacy of medical data while completing a task."
Ethics virtual patients: a new pedagogical tool for educators?,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS,"Virtual patient (VP) cases are interactive computer simulations of real life scenarios that have been used in medical education for over a decade. They are popular with students and staff alike and have been shown to improve knowledge retention, clinical reasoning and decision-making skills. Ethics virtual patient (EVP) cases are interactive computer simulations of real life scenarios which have a substantive ethical component. They can also contain significant legal and professionalism components. EVP cases have only recently been used in medical education, but there is growing evidence to suggest that medical students find them interesting, engaging and helpful. This paper will provide a brief overview of the way in which EVP cases have been used at St George's, University of London and explore the pedagogical rationale for using these cases to teach ethics, law and professionalism to medical students."
Anaesthesiology students' Non-Technical skills: development and evaluation of a behavioural marker system for students (AS-NTS),BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,"BackgroundNon-Technical Skills (NTS) are becoming more important in medical education. A lack of NTS was identified as a major reason for unsafe patient care, favouring adverse events and team breakdown. Therefore, the training of NTS should already be implemented in undergraduate teaching. The goal of our study was to develop and validate the Anaesthesiology Students' Non-Technical Skills (AS-NTS) as a feasible rating tool to assess students' NTS in emergency and anaesthesiology education.MethodsThe development of AS-NTS was empirically grounded in expert- and focus groups, field observations and data from NTS in medical fields. Validation, reliability and usability testing was conducted in 98 simulation scenarios, during emergency and anaesthesiology training sessions.ResultsAS-NTS showed an excellent interrater reliability (mean 0.89), achieved excellent content validity indexes (at least 0.8) and was rated as feasible and applicable by educators. Additionally, we could rule out the influence of the raters' anaesthesiology and emergency training and experience in education on the application of the rating tool.ConclusionsAS-NTS provides a structured approach to the assessment of NTS in undergraduates, providing accurate feedback. The findings of usability, validity and reliability indicate that AS-NTS can be used by anaesthesiologists in different year of postgraduate training, even with little experience in medical education."
Sample Size Considerations in Clinical Trials When Comparing Two Interventions Using Multiple Co-Primary Binary Relative Risk Contrasts,STATISTICS IN BIOPHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH,"The effects of interventions are multidimensional. Use of more than one primary endpoint offers an attractive design feature in clinical trials as they capture more complete characterization of the effects of an intervention and provide more informative intervention comparisons. For these reasons, multiple primary endpoints have become a common design feature in many disease areas such as oncology, infectious disease, and cardiovascular disease. More specifically in medical product development, multiple endpoints are used as co-primary to evaluate the effect of the new interventions. Although methodologies to address continuous co-primary endpoints are well-developed, methodologies for binary endpoints are limited. In this article, we describe power and sample size determination for clinical trials with multiple correlated binary endpoints, when relative risks are evaluated as co-primary. We consider a scenario where the objective is to evaluate evidence for superiority of a test intervention compared with a control intervention, for all of the relative risks. We discuss the normal approximation methods for power and sample size calculations and evaluate how the required sample size, power, and Type I error vary as a function of the correlations among the endpoints. Also we discuss a simple, but conservative procedure for appropriate sample size calculation. We then extend the methods allowing for interim monitoring using group-sequential methods. Supplementary materials for this article are available online."
Virtual Alternative to the Oral Examination for Emergency Medicine Residents,WESTERN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE,"Introduction: The oral examination is a traditional method for assessing the developing physician's medical knowledge, clinical reasoning and interpersonal skills. The typical oral examination is a face-to-face encounter in which examiners quiz examinees on how they would confront a patient case. The advantage of the oral exam is that the examiner can adapt questions to the examinee's response. The disadvantage is the potential for examiner bias and intimidation. Computer-based virtual simulation technology has been widely used in the gaming industry. We wondered whether virtual simulation could serve as a practical format for delivery of an oral examination. For this project, we compared the attitudes and performance of emergency medicine (EM) residents who took our traditional oral exam to those who took the exam using virtual simulation. Methods: EM residents (n=35) were randomized to a traditional oral examination format (n=17) or a simulated virtual examination format (n=18) conducted within an immersive learning environment, Second Life (SL). Proctors scored residents using the American Board of Emergency Medicine oral examination assessment instruments, which included execution of critical actions and ratings on eight competency categories (1-8 scale). Study participants were also surveyed about their oral examination experience. Results: We observed no differences between virtual and traditional groups on critical action scores or scores on eight competency categories. However, we noted moderate effect sizes favoring the Second Life group on the clinical competence score. Examinees from both groups thought that their assessment was realistic, fair, objective, and efficient. Examinees from the virtual group reported a preference for the virtual format and felt that the format was less intimidating. Conclusion: The virtual simulated oral examination was shown to be a feasible alternative to the traditional oral examination format for assessing EM residents. Virtual environments for oral examinations should continue to be explored, particularly since they offer an inexpensive, more comfortable, yet equally rigorous alternative."
A simulation-based evaluation of machine learning models for clinical decision support: application and analysis using hospital readmission,NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE,"The interest in applying machine learning in healthcare has grown rapidly in recent years. Most predictive algorithms requiring pathway implementations are evaluated using metrics focused on predictive performance, such as the c statistic. However, these metrics are of limited clinical value, for two reasons: (1) they do not account for the algorithm's role within a provider workflow; and (2) they do not quantify the algorithm's value in terms of patient outcomes and cost savings. We propose a model for simulating the selection of patients over time by a clinician using a machine learning algorithm, and quantifying the expected patient outcomes and cost savings. Using data on unplanned emergency department surgical readmissions, we show that factors such as the provider's schedule and postoperative prediction timing can have major effects on the pathway cohort size and potential cost reductions from preventing hospital readmissions."
Efficacy Outcome Selection in the Therapeutic Hypothermia After Pediatric Cardiac Arrest Trials,PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE,"Objectives: The Therapeutic Hypothermia After Pediatric Cardiac Arrest trials will determine whether therapeutic hypothermia improves survival with good neurobehavioral outcome, as assessed by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales Second Edition, in children resuscitated after cardiac arrest in the in-hospital and out-of-hospital settings. We describe the innovative efficacy outcome selection process during Therapeutic Hypothermia After Pediatric Cardiac Arrest protocol development. Design/Setting: Consensus assessment of potential outcomes and evaluation timepoints. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: We evaluated practical and technical advantages of several follow-up timepoints and continuous/categorical outcome variants. Simulations estimated power assuming varying hypothermia benefit on mortality and on neurobehavioral function among survivors. Twelve months after arrest was selected as the optimal assessment timepoint for pragmatic and clinical reasons. Change in Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales Second Edition from prearrest level, measured as quasicontinuous with death and vegetative status being worst-possible levels, yielded optimal statistical power. However, clinicians preferred simpler multicategorical or binary outcomes because of easier interpretability and favored outcomes based solely on postarrest status because of concerns about accurate parental assessment of prearrest status and differing clinical impact of a given Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales Second Edition change depending on prearrest status. Simulations found only modest power loss from categorizing or dichotomizing quasicontinuous outcomes because of high expected mortality. The primary outcome selected was survival with 12-month Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales Second Edition no less than two SD below a reference population mean (70 points), necessarily evaluated only among children with prearrest Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales Second Edition greater than or equal to 70. Two secondary efficacy outcomes, 12-month survival and quasicontinuous Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales Second Edition change from prearrest level, will be evaluated among all randomized children, including those with compromised function prearrest. Conclusions: Extensive discussion of optimal efficacy assessment timing, and of the advantages versus drawbacks of incorporating prearrest status and using quasicontinuous versus simpler outcomes, was highly beneficial to the final Therapeutic Hypothermia After Pediatric Cardiac Arrest design. A relatively simple, binary primary outcome evaluated at 12 months was selected, with two secondary outcomes that address the potential disadvantages of primary outcome."
Does the revised intubating laryngeal tube (ILTS-D2) perform better than the intubating laryngeal mask (Fastrach)? - a randomised simulation research study,BMC ANESTHESIOLOGY,"Background The intubating laryngeal tube (ILTS-D (TM)) and the intubating laryngeal mask (Fastrach (TM)) are devices that facilitate both extraglottic application and blind tracheal intubation. A revised model of the iLTS-D (for scientific reasons called ILTS-D2) has been designed but not yet evaluated. Therefore, we compared the ILTS-D2 with the established Fastrach under controlled conditions in a prospective randomised controlled simulation research study. Methods After ethical approval, we randomised 126 medical students into two groups. Each participant received either Fastrach or ILTS-D2 to perform five consecutive ventilation attempts in a manikin. The primary endpoint was the time to ventilation in the last attempt of using the devices as extraglottic devices. Secondary endpoints were the time to tracheal intubation and the success rates. Results There was no relevant difference between the two devices in the time to ventilation in the last of five attempts (Fastrach: median 14 s [IQR: 12-15]; ILTS-D2: median 13 s [IQR: 12-15], p = 0.592). Secondary endpoints showed a 2 s faster blind tracheal intubation using the Fastrach than using the ILTS-D2 (Fastrach: median 14 s [IQR: 13-17]; ILTS-D2: median 16 s [IQR: 15-20] p < 0.001). For both devices, the success rates were 100% in the last attempt. Conclusions Concerning extraglottic airway management, we could not detect a relevant difference between the revised ILTS-D2 and the Fastrach under laboratory conditions. We advocate for an evaluation of the ILTS-D2 in randomised controlled clinical trials."
Evaluating professionalism in medical undergraduates using selected response questions: findings from an item response modelling study,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background: Professionalism is a difficult construct to define in medical students but aspects of this concept may be important in predicting the risk of postgraduate misconduct. For this reason attempts are being made to evaluate medical students' professionalism. This study investigated the psychometric properties of Selected Response Questions (SRQs) relating to the theme of professional conduct and ethics comparing them with two sets of control items: those testing pure knowledge of anatomy, and; items evaluating the ability to integrate and apply knowledge (skills). The performance of students on the SRQs was also compared with two external measures estimating aspects of professionalism in students; peer ratings of professionalism and their Conscientiousness Index, an objective measure of behaviours at medical school. Methods: Item Response Theory (IRT) was used to analyse both question and student performance for SRQs relating to knowledge of professionalism, pure anatomy and skills. The relative difficulties, discrimination and 'guessabilities' of each theme of question were compared with each other using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Student performance on each topic was compared with the measures of conscientiousness and professionalism using parametric and non-parametric tests as appropriate. A post-hoc analysis of power for the IRT modelling was conducted using a Monte Carlo simulation. Results: Professionalism items were less difficult compared to the anatomy and skills SRQs, poorer at discriminating between candidates and more erratically answered when compared to anatomy questions. Moreover professionalism item performance was uncorrelated with the standardised Conscientiousness Index scores (rho = 0.009, p = 0.90). In contrast there were modest but significant correlations between standardised Conscientiousness Index scores and performance at anatomy items (rho = 0.20, p = 0.006) though not skills (rho = .11, p = .1). Likewise, students with high peer ratings for professionalism had superior performance on anatomy SRQs but not professionalism themed questions. A trend of borderline significance (p = .07) was observed for performance on skills SRQs and professionalism nomination status. Conclusions: SRQs related to professionalism are likely to have relatively poor psychometric properties and lack associations with other constructs associated with undergraduate professional behaviour. The findings suggest that such questions should not be included in undergraduate examinations and may raise issues with the introduction of Situational Judgement Tests into Foundation Years selection."
"Web-based learning: pros, cons and controversies",CLINICAL MEDICINE,"Advantages of web-based learning (WBL) in medical education include overcoming barriers of distance and time, economies of scale, and novel instructional methods, while disadvantages include social isolation, up-front costs, and technical problems. Web-based learning is purported to facilitate individualised instruction, but this is currently more vision than reality. More importantly, many WBL instructional designs fail to incorporate principles of effective learning, and WBL is often used for the wrong reasons (eg for the sake of technology). Rather than trying to decide whether WBL is superior to or equivalent to other instructional media (research addressing this question will always be confounded), we should accept it as a potentially powerful instructional tool, and focus on learning when and how to use it. Educators should recognise that high fidelity, multimedia, simulations, and even WBL itself will not always be necessary to effectively facilitate learning."
How vague is vague? A simulation study of the impact of the use of vague prior distributions in MCMC using WinBUGS,STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,"There has been a recent growth in the use of Bayesian methods in medical research. The main reasons for this are the development of computer intensive simulation based methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), increases in computing power and the introduction of powerful software such as WinBUGS. This has enabled increasingly complex models to be fitted. The ability to fit these complex models has led to MCMC methods being used as a convenient tool by frequentists, who may have no desire to be fully Bayesian. Often researchers want 'the data to dominate' when there is no prior information and thus attempt to use vague prior distributions. However, with small amounts of data the use of vague priors can be problematic. The results are potentially sensitive to the choice of prior distribution. In general there are fewer problems with location parameters. The main problem is with scale parameters. With scale parameters, not only does one have to decide the distributional form of the prior distribution, but also whether to put the prior distribution on the variance, standard deviation or precision. We have conducted a simulation study comparing the effects of 13 different prior distributions for the scale parameter on simulated random effects meta-analysis data. We varied the number of studies (5, 10 and 30) and compared three different between-study variances to give nine different simulation scenarios. One thousand data sets were generated for each scenario and each data set was analysed using the 13 different prior distributions. The frequentist properties of bias and coverage were investigated for the between-study variance and the effect size. The choice of prior distribution was crucial when there were just five studies. There was a large variation in the estimates of the between-study variance for the 13 different prior distributions. With a large number of studies the choice of prior distribution was less important. The effect size estimated was not biased, but the precision with which it was estimated varied with the choice of prior distribution leading to varying coverage intervals and, potentially, to different statistical inferences. Again there was less of a problem with a larger number of studies. There is a particular problem if the between-study variance is close to the boundary at zero, as MCMC results tend to produce upwardly biased estimates of the between-study variance, particularly if inferences are based on the posterior mean. The choice of 'vague' prior distribution can lead to a marked variation in results, particularly in small studies. Sensitivity to the choice of prior distribution should always be assessed.

A Framework for Different Levels of Integration of Computational Models Into Web-Based Virtual Patients,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,"Background: Virtual patients are increasingly common tools used in health care education to foster learning of clinical reasoning skills. One potential way to expand their functionality is to augment virtual patients' interactivity by enriching them with computational models of physiological and pathological processes. Objective: The primary goal of this paper was to propose a conceptual framework for the integration of computational models within virtual patients, with particular focus on (1) characteristics to be addressed while preparing the integration, (2) the extent of the integration, (3) strategies to achieve integration, and (4) methods for evaluating the feasibility of integration. An additional goal was to pilot the first investigation of changing framework variables on altering perceptions of integration. Methods: The framework was constructed using an iterative process informed by Soft System Methodology. The Virtual Physiological Human (VPH) initiative has been used as a source of new computational models. The technical challenges associated with development of virtual patients enhanced by computational models are discussed from the perspectives of a number of different stakeholders. Concrete design and evaluation steps are discussed in the context of an exemplar virtual patient employing the results of the VPH ARCH project, as well as improvements for future iterations. Results: The proposed framework consists of four main elements. The first element is a list of feasibility features characterizing the integration process from three perspectives: the computational modelling researcher, the health care educationalist, and the virtual patient system developer. The second element included three integration levels: basic, where a single set of simulation outcomes is generated for specific nodes in the activity graph; intermediate, involving pre-generation of simulation datasets over a range of input parameters; advanced, including dynamic solution of the model. The third element is the description of four integration strategies, and the last element consisted of evaluation profiles specifying the relevant feasibility features and acceptance thresholds for specific purposes. The group of experts who evaluated the virtual patient exemplar found higher integration more interesting, but at the same time they were more concerned with the validity of the result. The observed differences were not statistically significant. Conclusions: This paper outlines a framework for the integration of computational models into virtual patients. The opportunities and challenges of model exploitation are discussed from a number of user perspectives, considering different levels of model integration. The long-term aim for future research is to isolate the most crucial factors in the framework and to determine their influence on the integration outcome."
The effects of web-based situational learning on nursing students' transfer of learning in clinical practice,NURSE EDUCATION TODAY,"Background: Transferring what has been learned in the classroom to clinical application is the main goal of nursing education. Our previous intervention study, in which a web-based interactive situational teaching strategy in a nursing ethic course was conducted as an experimental group, and the students in the class who were taught using a traditional teaching strategy was treated as the comparative group. The results, which were evaluated immediately after the class, showed that the web-based interactive situational teaching enhanced the students' competency in ethical reasoning and problem solving compared to traditional teaching. Purpose: This study followed the previous study and aimed to compare the effects of the learning transfer between the two groups in clinical performance as reflected in their internship scores, clinical practice, and self-efficacy assessment. It also explored the factors influencing this transfer. Method: A predictive correlation-based research design was adopted to compare the students' internship scores, clinical judgment abilities, and self-efficacy in clinical internships between two groups. The students' self-efficacy was measured using a self-administered structured questionnaire, while their internship scores and clinical judgment abilities were evaluated by their clinical instructors. The data obtained were statistically analyzed using SPSS 23 software. Results: The nursing students who participated in the web-based interactive situational teaching course did not significantly outperform those who received traditional teaching in their clinical judgment and internship scores. The main variable that significantly affected the clinical self-efficacy of nursing students was the degree of support from the internship instructors. Conclusion: Nursing students' clinical performance is affected by multiple factors and is not solely determined by the curriculum or teaching strategies. The degree of instructor support during the internship process significantly affected the students' self-efficacy in clinical performance."
Use of a computer-based simulated consultation tool to assess whether doctors explore sociocultural factors during patient evaluation,JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE,"Rationale, aims and objectives The delivery of patient-centred care to diverse populations requires that doctors identify sociocultural factors that may affect care. We adapted a computer-based simulated consultation tool and tested its utility for assessing whether doctors explore sociocultural factors during a patient evaluation, and whether they include such information in their case conclusions and follow-up recommendations. Methods We developed two detailed patient 'stories' that involved sociocultural issues that doctors needed to identify and consider for adequate clinical management. They were incorporated into an existing 'Virtual Internet Patient Simulation' (VIPS) program designed to test clinical reasoning skills. Doctors and medical students (n = 618) were invited to access the program via Internet. For each consultation, participants were assigned a sociocultural score, corresponding to the number of sociocultural domains explored. Scores were then compared with subjective ratings of participants' performance by expert doctors. Results 118 respondents completed at least one virtual consultation (19%), 92 conducted both. The mean number of sociocultural dimensions explored by doctors (i.e. sociocultural score) was 3.9 (standard deviation 2.6) for case 1, and 5.2 (standard deviation 2.3) for case 2. The two sociocultural scores were moderately correlated (Spearman r = 0.65, P < 0.001). Sociocultural scores correlated positively with experts' subjective ratings of participants' performance (Spearman r = 0.84 for case 1 and 0.78 for case 2, both P < 0.001). Conclusions The adapted computer-based simulated consultation tool provided a feasible means to assess doctors' exploration of sociocultural issues during a clinical evaluation. Further validation of this method should be conducted by comparing VIPS results with other skills assessment methods such as objective structured clinical examination or direct observation of clinical performance."
Joint modelling with competing risks of dropout for longitudinal analysis of health-related quality of life in cancer clinical trials,QUALITY OF LIFE RESEARCH,"Purpose Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important endpoint in cancer clinical trials. Analysis of HRQoL longitudinal data is plagued by missing data, notably due to dropout. Joint models are increasingly receiving attention for modelling longitudinal outcomes and the time-to-dropout. However, dropout can be informative or non-informative depending on the cause. Methods We propose using a joint model that includes a competing risks sub-model for the cause-specific time-to-dropout. We compared a competing risks joint model (CR JM) that distinguishes between two causes of dropout with a standard joint model (SJM) that treats all the dropouts equally. First, we applied the CR JM and SJM to data from 267 patients with advanced oesophageal cancer from the randomized clinical trial PRODIGE 5/ACCORD 17 to analyse HRQoL data in the presence of dropouts unrelated and related to a clinical event. Then, we compared the models using a simulation study. Results We showed that the CR JM performed as well as the SJM in situations where the risk of dropout was the same whatever the cause. In the presence of both informative and non-informative dropouts, only the SJM estimations were biased, impacting the HRQoL estimated parameters. Conclusion The systematic collection of the reasons for dropout in clinical trials would facilitate the use of CR JMs, which could be a satisfactory approach to analysing HRQoL data in presence of both informative and non-informative dropout."
Use of EHR-based simulation to diagnose aetiology of information gathering issues in struggling learners: a proof of concept study,BMJ SIMULATION & TECHNOLOGY ENHANCED LEARNING,"Learners who struggle with clinical decision making are often the most challenging to identify and remediate. While for some learners, struggles can be directly traced to a poor knowledge base, for many others, it is more difficult to understand the reason for their struggles. One of the main component of effective decision making is access to accurate and complete clinical information. The electronic health record (EHR) is the main source of clinical information and, with its widespread adoption, has come increased realisation that a large fraction of users have difficulty in effectively gathering and subsequently processing information out of the EHR. We previously documented that high-fidelity EHR-based simulation improves EHR usability and, when combined with eye and screen tracking, generates important measures of usability. We hypothesised that the same simulation exercise could help distinguish whether learners had difficulty in knowledge, information gathering or information processing. We report the results of the first three struggling learners who participated in this exercise. In each case, the simulation was able to diagnose' the aetiology for the learners' struggle and assist in formulating an appropriate solution. We suggest that high-fidelity EHR-based simulation can be a powerful tool in the standard approach to understanding struggling learners."
Monte Carlo Modeling of Light Propagation in the Human Head for Applications in Sinus Imaging,PHOTONIC THERAPEUTICS AND DIAGNOSTICS XI,"Sinus blockages are a common reason for physician visits, affecting 1 out of 7 in the United States. Over 20 million cases of acute bacterial sinusitis become chronic and require medical treatment. Diagnosis in the primary care setting is challenging because symptom criteria (via detailed clinical history) plus objective imaging (CT or endoscopy) is recommended. Unfortunately, neither option is routinely available in primary care. Our previous work demonstrated that low-cost near infrared (NIR) transillumination instruments produced signals that correlated with the bulk findings of sinus opacity measured by CT. We have upgraded the technology, but questions remain such as finding the optimal arrangement of light sources, measuring the influence of specific anatomical structures, and determining detection limits. In order to begin addressing these questions, we have modeled NIR light propagation inside the adult human head using a mesh-based Monte Carlo algorithm (MMCLab) applied to a detailed anatomical head model constructed from CT images. In this application the sinus itself, which under healthy conditions is a void region (e.g., non-scattering), is the region of interest instead of an obstacle to other contrast mechanisms. We report preliminary simulations that characterize the changes in detected intensity due to clear (i.e., healthy) versus blocked sinuses. We also ran simulations for two of our clinical cases and compared results with the measurements. The simulations presented herein serve as a proof of concept that this approach could be used to understand contrast mechanisms and limitations of NIR imaging of the sinus cavities."
A Comparison Between a Meta-analytic Approach and Power Prior Approach to Using Historical Control Information in Clinical Trials With Binary Endpoints,THERAPEUTIC INNOVATION & REGULATORY SCIENCE,"Background: In the process of research and development of a new treatment, clinical trials are conducted to evaluate its safety and efficacy. Key to streamlining the process is to utilize appropriate historical information on an outcome of a control treatment when designing and analyzing a clinical trial. Methods: For the use of such historical control information, there exist a meta-analytic approach and power prior approach. In this article, we evaluate their performance with regard to the type I error (TIE) rate and power through a simulation study where we analyze the data on a binary outcome of an experimental treatment and a control treatment from a new small-scale trial, along with the corresponding data of the control treatment from multiple historical trials. The reason is that the difference in the performance between the 2 approaches has not been clear. Results: When historical trials were homogeneous, the power was higher in the power prior approach and the meta-analytic approach using a beta-binomial model with a less noninformative prior than the other approaches. However, when heterogeneous historical trials were mixed, the power was lower, or the TIE rates got inflated. Conclusions: To make use of historical control data, if importance is attached to control of the TIE rate, the meta-analytic approach using a normal-normal hierarchical model may be preferable to the power prior approach, whereas if attached to improvement of the power, this preference be reversed. Anyway, the best approach should be chosen by comparing the operational characteristics of the approaches."

9 A comprehensive and volumetric musculoskeletal model for the dynamic simulation of the shoulder function,COMPUTER METHODS IN BIOMECHANICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,"We present a volumetric and extensive finite element model of the shoulder usable in the context of inverse control, in which the scapula is left unconstrained on the ribcage. Such a model allows for exploring various shoulder movements, which are essential for making patient-specific decisions. The proposed model consists of 23 volumetric muscles parts modelled using the finite element method. The glenohumeral, acromioclavicular and sternoclavicular joints are modelled with soft ball-socket constraints. The musculoskeletal model can be controlled by a tracking-based algorithm, finding the excitations values in the muscles needed to follow some target points. The moment arms obtained during abduction and rotation are compared with the literature, which includes results from cadaveric data and a fine FE model of the rotator cuff and the deltoid. We simulated the paralysis of serratus anterior, a main reason of scapular winging, and compared it with its physiological counterpart. A deficiency in the range of motion as well as a reduction in upward rotation were observed, which both corroborate clinical observations. This is one of the most comprehensive model of the shoulder, which can be used to study complex pathologies of the shoulder and their impact on functional outcome such as range-of-motion."
Computational study on the drug resistance mechanism of hepatitis C virus NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase mutants to BMS-791325 by molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy calculations,CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS,"Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is an attractive target for anti-HCV development. Several mutations such as A421V, 13921 and P495L in thumb'I pocket of HCV NS5B polymerase have been proved to be resistant to BMS-791325 (Phase III clinical trial). A deep understanding of the resistance mechanism conferred by these mutations is important to the design and discovery of more new effective drugs against resistant HCV strains. We performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, free energy calculation and adaptive biasing force (ABF) simulation to study the possible resistance mechanism conferred by the above mutants. MD simulation results show the hydrophobic interaction is the driving force for BMS-791325 binding. ABF simulation proves that attenuation of the hydrophilic interaction between R503 and BMS-791325 is the first step for drug to escape from the binding site. Loss of the hydrophilic interaction makes drug easily to move out of the hydrophobic pocket. The simulation results further reveal that A421V, L392I and P495L mutants reduce drug binding affinity. P495L mutant makes the binding pocket more flexible and cannot anchor BMS-791325. The altered hydrophilic interactions of mutant residues are the essential reasons leading to drug resistance in A421V and L392I mutants. Our results will provide useful information to develop effective HCV NS5B inhibitors against resistance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Effectiveness of a serious game addressing guideline adherence: cohort study with 1.5-year follow-up,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background Patients presenting with acute shortness of breath and chest pain should be managed according to guideline recommendations. Serious games can be used to train clinical reasoning. However, only few studies have used outcomes beyond student satisfaction, and most of the published evidence is based on short-term follow-up. This study investigated the effectiveness of a digital simulation of an emergency ward regarding appropriate clinical decision-making. Methods In this prospective trial that ran from summer 2017 to winter 2018/19 at Gottingen Medical University Centre, a total of 178 students enrolled in either the fourth or the fifth year of undergraduate medical education took six 90-min sessions of playing a serious game ('training phase') in which they managed virtual patients presenting with various conditions. Learning outcome was assessed by analysing log-files of in-game activity (including choice of diagnostic methods, differential diagnosis and treatment initiation) with regard to history taking and patient management in three virtual patient cases: Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), pulmonary embolism (PE) and hypertensive crisis. Fourth-year students were followed up for 1.5 years, and their final performance was compared to the performance of students who had never been exposed to the game but had otherwise taken the same five-year undergraduate course. Results During the training phase, overall performance scores increased from 57.6 +/- 1.1% to 65.5 +/- 1.2% (p < 0.001; effect size 0.656). Performance remained stable over 1.5 years, and the final assessment revealed a strong impact of ever-exposure to the game on management scores (72.6 +/- 1.2% vs. 63.5 +/- 2.1%, p < 0.001; effect size 0.811). Pre-exposed students were more than twice as likely to correctly diagnose NSTEMI and PE and showed significantly greater adherence to guideline recommendations (e.g., troponin measurement and D-dimer testing in suspected PE). Conclusions The considerable difference observed between previously exposed and unexposed students suggests a long-term effect of using the game although retention of specific virtual patient cases rather than general principles might partially account for this effect. Thus, the game may foster the implementation of guideline recommendations."
What explains the differences between centres in the European screening trial? A simulation study,CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY,"Background: The European Randomised study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) is a multicentre, randomised screening trial on men aged 55-69 years at baseline without known prostate cancer (PrCa) at randomisation to an intervention arm invited to screening or to a control arm. The ERSPC has shown a significant 21% reduction in PrCa mortality at 13 years of follow-up. The effect of screening appears to vary across centres, for which several explanations are possible. We set to assess if the apparent differences in PrCa mortality reduction between the centres can be explained by differences in screening protocols. Methods: We examined the centre differences by developing a simulation model and estimated how alternative screening protocols would have affected PrCa mortality. Results: Our results showed outcomes similar to those observed, when the results by centres were reproduced by simulating the screening regimens with PSA threshold of 3 versus 4 ng/ml, or screening interval of two versus four years. The findings suggest that the differences are only marginally attributable to the different screening protocols. Conclusion: The small screening impact in Finland was not explained by the differences in the screening protocols. A possible reason for it was the contamination of and the unexpectedly low PrCa mortality in the Finnish control arm. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
A digital application for implementing the ICD-11 traditional medicine chapter,JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE-JIM,"On May 25, 2019, the World Health Assembly approved the eleventh revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11), containing a chapter on traditional medicine. This means that the traditional East Asian medicine (TEAM) is now officially recognized as a part of mainstream medical practice. However, the patterns presented in the ICD-11 traditional medicine chapter are only the tip of the iceberg of TEAM clinical practice, and it will be necessary to supplement and upgrade the contents. In order to implement this, objectification and standardization of TEAM must be premised, and grafting with proper modern science and technology is imperative. Pattern Identification and Prescription Expert-11 (PIPE-11), which is a TEAM clinical decision support system, adopts vastly from clinical literature on pattern identification and the prescription. By adopting the rule-based reasoning method, the way of diagnosis and prescription by a TEAM practitioner in actual clinical practice is implemented as it is. PIPE-11 could support to improve both the accuracy of medical diagnosis and the reliability of the medical treatment of TEAM in clinical practices. In the field of research, it might facilitate the usage for reliable reference for symptoms and signs retrieval and patient simulation. In the field of education, it can provide a high level of training for learning pattern identification and prescription, and further be used to reinforce skills of diagnosis and prescription by providing self-simulation methods. Therefore, PIPE-11 as a digital application is expected to support the traditional medicine chapter of ICD-11 to successfully contribute to the improvement of human health.

Various channel sizes were tested to optimize the diffusion and anisotropy properties. We succeeded in producing a phantom with high anisotropy (FA = 0.8). However, a reason of high axial diffusivity needs further investigations."
Bayesian inference for randomized clinical trials with treatment failures,STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,"During the course of a clinical trial, subjects may experience treatment failure. For ethical reasons, it is necessary to administer emergency or rescue medications for such subjects. However, the rescue medications may bias the set of response measurements. This bias is of particular concern if a subject has been randomized to the control group, and the rescue medications improve the subject's condition. The standard approach to analysing data from a clinical trial is to perform an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis, wherein the data are analysed according to treatment randomization. Supplementary analyses may be performed in addition to the ITT analysis to account for the effect of treatment failures and rescue medications. A Bayesian, counterfactual approach, which uses the data augmentation (DA) algorithm, is proposed for supplemental analysis. A simulation study is conducted to compare the operating characteristics of this procedure with a likelihood-based, counterfactual approach based on the EM algorithm. An example from the Asthma Clinical Research Network (ACRN) is used to illustrate the Bayesian procedure. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd."
Population Pharmacokinetic Modeling and Simulation of Afloqualone to Predict Steady-state Exposure Levels,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY,"Background and Objective: Afloqualone (AFQ) is a quinazoline family GABAergic drug used as muscle relaxant. After oral administration of AFQ, greatly elevated exposure in some individuals were observed which might cause severe side effects. The aim of this study was to develop a population pharmacokinetic model of AFQ and search possible reason of high inter-individual variability (IIV) in the clinical study and further demonstrate its impact on exposure on AFQ through simulation. Methodology: To evaluate the exposure of AFQ and confirm the high difference between subjects, non-compartmental analysis was assessed. A Population PK model of AFQ was developed using healthy human AFQ PK data and simulation study was performed with final PK model. Results: A two-compartment model with first order absorption and elimination was used to explain the pharmacokinetics of AFQ. The high level of HIV in AFQ exposure was explained through assumption two subject group with high exposure group (HEG) or normal exposure group (NEG). Through simulations, it was proved that big difference of AFQ exposure between subjects could be observed in some individual and dose of AFQ needs to be reduced for such subjects in HEG. Conclusion: Population PK model of AFQ for explaining high IIV was successfully developed and exposure of AFQ between subjects was simulated. Finally, suggesting an appropriate dose of AFQ in HEG which could be had possibility of genetic polymorphism."
Validating laboratory results in a national observational cohort study without field centers: The Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke cohort,CLINICAL BIOCHEMISTRY,"Objectives: The REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study is a prospective cohort of 30,239 Americans in the contiguous United States; the first of this scale to use home visits to obtain, process, and ship biologic samples to a core laboratory. Pre-analytical factors resulting from this study design may affect the results of some laboratory assays. We investigated the impact of REGARDS processing on a variety of analytes. Design and methods: In REGARDS, blood samples were processed in the field by technicians who were trained on standardized methods for phlebotomy and sample processing. Field processing included centrifugation using varying non-uniform equipment and shipping overnight on ice to the University of Vermont, where samples were re-centrifuged for 30,000 xg-minutes and stored at -80 degrees C. We assessed the effects of REGARDS sample handling by processing split samples from 20 volunteers using either ideal procedures or simulated REGARDS procedures. Assays for 19 analytes for potential study in REGARDS were then run on both samples and results compared. Results: Spearman correlation coefficients for analytes measured in ideal versus REGARDS processed samples ranged from 0.11 to 1.0. Thirteen of 19 analytes were highly correlated (>0.75), but platelet proteins were more variable. Conclusions: Simulation of non-optimal field processing and shipment to a central laboratory showed high variability in analytes released by platelets. The majority of other analytes produced valid results, but platelet contamination in REGARDS samples makes measurement of platelet proteins unadvisable in these samples. Future analytes considered by REGARDS or similar studies should undergo similar pilot testing. (C) 2014 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists. Published by Elsevier Inc."
Statistical issues in TBI clinical studies,FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY,"The identification and longitudinal assessment of traumatic brain injury presents several challenges. Because these injuries can have subtle effects, efforts to find quantitative physiological measures that can be used to characterize traumatic brain injury are receiving increased attention. The results of this research must be considered with care. Six reasons for cautious assessment are outlined in this paper. None of the issues raised here are new. They are standard elements in the technical literature that describes the mathematical analysis of clinical data. The purpose of this paper is to draw attention to these issues because they need to be considered when clinicians evaluate the usefulness of this research. In some instances these points are demonstrated by simulation studies of diagnostic processes. We take as an additional objective the explicit presentation of the mathematical methods used to reach these conclusions. This material is in the appendices. The following points are made: (1)A statistically significant separation of a clinical population from a control population does not ensure a successful diagnostic procedure. (2) Adding more variables to a diagnostic discrimination can, in some instances, actually reduce classification accuracy. (3) A high sensitivity and specificity in a TBI versus control population classification does not ensure diagnostic successes when the method is applied in a more general neuropsychiatric population. (4) Evaluation of treatment effectiveness must recognize that high variability is a pronounced characteristic of an injured central nervous system and that results can be confounded by either disease progression or spontaneous recovery. A large pre-treatment versus post-treatment effect size does not, of itself, establish a successful treatment. (5) A procedure for discriminating between treatment responders and non-responders requires, minimally, a two phase investigation. This procedure must include a mechanism to discriminate between treatment responders, placebo responders, and spontaneous recovery. (6) A search for prodromes of neuropsychiatric disorders following traumatic brain injury can be implemented with these procedures."
Simulation Study of Resistive-Plate-Chambers based PET for hadron-therapy monitoring,2011 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM AND MEDICAL IMAGING CONFERENCE (NSS/MIC),"This is a preliminary study on the feasibility of using Resistive-Plate-Chambers (RPC) based Positron Emission Tomography (PET) for hadron-therapy monitoring. The imaging capabilities of the RPC gas detector are being investigated for PET. Their main advantages are excellent timing resolution, low cost and Depth Of Interaction information (DOI) due to their layered structure. Hadron-therapy (HT) aims at treating tumors by maximizing the dose released to the target and sparing healthy tissue. During irradiation with a hadron beam, fragments, positron emitting isotopes and gamma radiation are produced. This radiation coming from the tissue activation could be used for quality control of the treatment. Our work focuses on imaging the positron emitting isotopes using an RPC-based PET scanner. The low cost of RPC makes possible to enlarge the angular coverage of the scanner guaranteeing the higher sensitivity needed by the in-beam monitoring. In addition, the TOF capability and spatial resolution makes worth investigating it. A first protoype is currently under construction at CERN in the TERA group. For this study, Monte Carlo simulations by means of GATE were employed. Up on our knowledge, such gas detectors have not been simulated yet in GATE and the new version of GATE offers new tools for dosimetry. These are the main reasons of choosing GATE. A set of linear sources, simulating the delivery of a hadron beam, has proposed to evaluate the image quality for an ideal time resolution of the system and the TOF information is being considered in the reconstruction. For the full ring simulated system, no important differences were found between TOF and non-TOF images, only the contrast was always better for the TOF-images. However, further simulations should be performed adapting the sytem to the real situation (partial ring) for HT and lowering the detected events to a clinical number. Under these circumstances, we expect to be crucial the TOF capabilities of the RPC-PET."
Dynamic properties of the native free antithrombin from molecular dynamics simulations: computational evidence for solvent- exposed Arg393 side chain,JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS,"While antithrombin (AT) has small basal inhibitory activity, it reaches its full inhibitory potential against activated blood coagulation factors, FXa, FIXa, and FIIa (thrombin), via an allosteric and/or template (bridging) mechanism by the action of heparin, heparan sulfate, or heparin-mimetic pentasaccharides (PS). From the numerous X-ray structures available for different conformational states of AT, only indirect and incomplete conclusions can be drawn on the inherently dynamic properties of AT. As a typical example, the basal inhibitory activity of AT cannot be interpreted on the basis of non-activated free antithrombin X-ray structures since the Arg393 side chain, playing crucial role in antithrombin-proteinase interaction, is not exposed. In order to reveal the intrinsic dynamic properties and the reason of basal inhibitory activity of antithrombin, 2 mu s molecular dynamics simulations were carried out on its native free-forms. It was shown from the simulation trajectories that the reactive center loop which is functioning as bait for proteases, even without any biasing potential can populate conformational state in which the Arg393 side chain is solvent exposed. It is revealed from the trajectory analysis that the peptide sequences correspond to the helix D extension, and new helix P formation can be featured with especially large root-mean-square fluctuations. Mutual information analyses of the trajectory showed remarkable (generalized) correlation between those regions of antithrombin which changed their conformations as the consequence of AT-PS complex formation. This suggests that allosteric information propagation pathways are present even in the non-activated native form of AT."
Defining the correctness of a diagnosis: differential judgments and expert knowledge,ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION,"Approaches that use a simulated patient case to study and assess diagnostic reasoning usually use the correct diagnosis of the case as a measure of success and as an anchor for other measures. Commonly, the correctness of a diagnosis is determined by the judgment of one or more experts. In this study, the consistency of experts' judgments of the correctness of a diagnosis, and the structure of knowledge supporting their judgments, were explored using a card sorting task. Seven expert pediatricians were asked to sort into piles the diagnoses proposed by 119 individuals who had worked through a simulated patient case of Haemophilus influenzae Type B (HIB) meningitis. The 119 individuals had varying experience levels. The expert pediatricians were asked to sort the proposed diagnoses by similarity of content, and then to order the piles based on correctness, relative to the known correct diagnosis (HIB meningitis). Finally, the experts were asked to judge which piles contained correct or incorrect diagnoses. We found that, contrary to previous studies, experts shared a common conceptual framework of the diagnostic domain being considered and were consistent in how they categorized the diagnoses. However, similar to previous studies, the experts differed greatly in their judgment of which diagnoses were correct. This study has important implications for understanding expert knowledge, for scoring performance on simulated or real patient cases, for providing feedback to learners in the clinical setting, and for establishing criteria that define what is correct in studies of diagnostic error and diagnostic reasoning."
Simulation-based education for novices: complex learning tasks promote reflective practice,MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Context Simulated clinical immersion (SCI), in which clinical situations are simulated in a realistic environment, safely and gradually exposes novices to complex problems. Given their limited experience, undergraduate students can potentially be quite overwhelmed by SCI learning tasks, which may result in misleading learning outcomes. Although task complexity should be adapted to the learner's level of expertise, many factors, both intrinsic and extraneous to the learning task, can influence perceived task complexity and its impact on cognitive processes. Objectives The purpose of this mixed-methods study was to understand the effects of task complexity on undergraduate pharmacy students' cognitive load, task performance and perception of learning in SCI. Methods A total of 167 second-year pharmacy students were randomly assigned to undertake one simple and one complex learning task in SCI consecutively. Participants' cognitive load was measured after each task and debriefing. Task performance and time on task were also assessed. As part of a sequential explanatory design, semi-structured interviews were conducted with students showing maximal variations in intrinsic cognitive load to elucidate their perceptions of learning when dealing with complexity. Results Although the complex task generated significantly higher cognitive load and time on task than the simple task, performance was high for both tasks. Qualitative results revealed that a lack of clinical experience, an unfamiliar resource in the environment and the constraints inherent to SCI, such as time limitations, hindered the clinical reasoning process and led to poorer self-evaluation of performance. Simple tasks helped students gain more self-confidence, whereas complex tasks further encouraged reflective practice during debriefings. Conclusions Although complex tasks in SCI were more cognitively demanding and took longer to execute, students indicated that they learned more from them than they did from simple tasks. Complex tasks constitute an additional challenge in terms of clinical reasoning and thus provide a more valuable learning experience from the student's perspective."
Intention-to-treat: methods for dealing with missing values in clinical trials of progressively deteriorating diseases,STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,"Since it came up in the 1960s, the principle of intention-to-treat (ITT) has become widely accepted for the analysis of controlled clinical trials. In this context the question of how to perform such an analysis in the presence of missing information about the main endpoint is of major importance. Uncritical use of several ad hoc strategies for dealing with missing values is common in the practice of clinical trials. On the other hand, little is known about possible dangers and problems of applying these strategies. We therefore performed a detailed investigation of different methods for dealing with missing values in order to develop recommendations for their practical use. A simulation study was performed investigating possible consequences on type I error and power of applying different methods for dealing with missing values. The simulations were based on a clinical trial of osteoporosis, a progressively deteriorating disease. The strategies examined can be roughly classified into numerical imputation strategies (last observation carried forward, mean and regression, based methods') and non-parametric strategies (rank and dichotomization based methods). Different drop-out mechanisms and different types of progression of disease are considered. The type I error increases drastically for the different strategies, especially if the courses of disease vary between treatment groups The loss in power can be substantial. There is no strategy which is adequate for all different combinations of drop-out mechanisms, drop-out rates and courses of disease over time. For drop-out rates less than 20 per cent and similar courses of disease in the treatment groups, missing values might be replaced by the mean of the other group, or counted as treatment failures after dichotomization of the endpoint. For larger drop-out rates or less similar courses of disease, no adequate recommendations! can be given. Because of the drastic consequences of increasing drop-out rates, it has to be, a primary goal in clinical trials to) keep missing values to a minimum. Unobserved information cannot be reliably regained by any methodological resources. As there are no strategies for universal use, reasons for the choice of a certain method have to be provided when designing and analysing clinical trials. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"An architecture for a continuous, user-driven, and data-driven application of clinical guidelines and its evaluation",JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS,"Objectives: Design, implement, and evaluate a new architecture for realistic continuous guideline (GL)-based decision support, based on a series of requirements that we have identified, such as support for continuous care, for multiple task types, and for data-driven and user-driven modes. Methods: We designed and implemented a new continuous GL-based support architecture, PICARD, which accesses a temporal reasoning engine, and provides several different types of application interfaces. We present the new architecture in detail in the current paper. To evaluate the architecture, we first performed a technical evaluation of the PICARD architecture, using 19 simulated scenarios in the preeclampsia/toxemia domain. We then performed a functional evaluation with the help of two domain experts, by generating patient records that simulate 60 decision points from six clinical guideline-based scenarios, lasting from two days to four weeks. Finally, 36 clinicians made manual decisions in half of the scenarios, and had access to the automated GL-based support in the other half. The measures used in all three experiments were correctness and completeness of the decisions relative to the GL. Results: Mean correctness and completeness in the technical evaluation were 1 +/- 0.0 and 0.96 +/- 0.03 respectively. The functional evaluation produced only several minor comments from the two experts, mostly regarding the output's style; otherwise the system's recommendations were validated. In the clinically oriented evaluation, the 36 clinicians applied manually approximately 41% of the GL's recommended actions. Completeness increased to approximately 93% when using PICARD. Manual correctness was approximately 94.5%, and remained similar when using PICARD; but while 68% of the manual decisions included correct but redundant actions, only 3% of the actions included in decisions made when using PICARD were redundant. Conclusions: The PICARD architecture is technically feasible and is functionally valid, and addresses the realistic continuous GL-based application requirements that we have defined; in particular, the requirement for care over significant time frames. The use of the PICARD architecture in the domain we examined resulted in enhanced completeness and in reduction of redundancies, and is potentially beneficial for general GL-based management of chronic patients.

The Importance of Humans in Simulation: Allowing the Lure of Technology to Drive Development,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 5TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON GAMES BASED LEARNING,"Serious games that simulate the subtle complexities of real life, pose a significant challenge in regards to requirements gathering. This case study involves a multi-player, inter-disciplinary medical game that simulates a hospital ward with medical scenarios based on the prescribed curriculum for junior doctors. Initially, both medical professionals and developers were focussed on finding ways to apply innovative 3D serious game technologies to build an eLearning environment for practical skills based medical training. The proposed system would allow an intern to play the role of an on-call doctor while employing AI and expert medical knowledge to simulate patients and supporting medical staff. However, a flaw in the basic premise of the project and the complexity of requirements forced unexpected changes during the development process. After the creation of text based documentation and flow charts for the medical diagnostic decision making processes, it became obvious that the subtly and complexities of the hospital ward and the interactions between patients and staff could not be adequately described through traditional documentation. To this end, the medical professionals developed video walkthroughs of real life scenarios reflecting good diagnostic practices and varying degrees of bad diagnostic practices. Along with the videos, PowerPoint slides were provided with key points, behaviours, and actions in the diagnostic and decision making process. Over an extended period of evolutionary requirements gathering, adaptive planning, prototyping, and testing, further inadequacies became evident. Email communications and videoconference proved to be inadequate. After extensive development, the only way to move forward was to organise face-to-face discussions between major stakeholders (a cross disciplinary team with educators, medical professionals, and IT professionals). At this point, a major flaw was identified and essential project requirements began to emerge. It was realised that teaching and learning outcomes had not driven the project. Rather, new technologies had been allowed to drive the project with learning outcomes constrained by the chosen technologies. It was further realised that the problem domain involved people and communications employing various mediums. It also became clear that the expert medical knowledge underlying the complexity of speech and behaviours required for the AI (such as a difficult patient or psychological issues) was far too complex to implement. This led to a movement away from AI driven avatars and a refocussing of the project on to human interactions and communication. This change in focus is currently being implemented through role-play of patients and health care professionals in a real time multi-player networked environment with the narrative set up through back stories. Testing was also refocussed on to clinical reasoning, problem solving, and communication skills with responses recorded in detail in communication logs for later evaluation and reflection. Features of the simulation are scheduled for testing at the Cairns Base Hospital using a group of 16 interns. A questionnaire will be administered before and after a play session involving a predefined medical scenario in a single player environment to help extract and refine the multi-player requirements for the current stage of development."
An assessment of the population variance of the strong ion gap using Monte Carlo simulation,ANAESTHESIA AND INTENSIVE CARE,"The strong ion gap is a derived parameter used to quantify clinically significant but unmeasured charged species in human plasma. In the general population the strong ion gap has a mean value of approximately 0.0 mEq/l, but at present no reference range exists. This severely limits its clinical application. In order to establish a reference range, a 95% confidence interval around the population mean must be calculated. As each of the variables that make lip the strong ion gap have their own unique and different means and standard deviations, simple methods of pooled variance can not be used to calculate this interval. In place of a direct solution, Monte Carlo methodology was employed using known reference standard deviations to construct a large sample of a simulated population. In addition, the partial correlation between the plasma concentrations of sodium and chloride was included in the calculations. Sample sets of 20,000 were simulated, each giving a normally distributed strong ion gap. A 95% confidence interval of 3.9 +/- 64 mEq/l was derived. Depending on the degree of strong ion correlation, minima and maxima for this reference range were calculated as 3.9 +/- 5.1 mEq/l and 3.9 +/- 7.6 mEq/l respectively. Reasons for the positive bias in the mean strong ion gap result are examined briefly."
Factors associated with delayed defibrillation in cardiopulmonary resuscitation: A prospective simulation study,PLOS ONE,"Introduction Early defibrillation is an important factor of survival in cardiac arrest. However, novice resuscitators often struggle with cardiac arrest patients. We investigated factors leading to delayed defibrillation performed by final-year medical students within a simulated bystander cardiac arrest situation. Methods Final-year medical students received a refresher lecture and basic life support training before being confronted with a simulated cardiac arrest situation in a simulation ambulance. The scenario was analyzed for factors leading to delayed defibrillation. We compared the time intervals the participants needed for various measures with a benchmark set by experienced resuscitators. After training, the participants were interviewed regarding challenges and thoughts during the scenario. Results The median time needed for defibrillation was 158 s (n = 49, interquartile range: 107-270 s), more than six-fold of the benchmark time. The major part of total defibrillation time (49%; median, n = 49) was between onset of ventricular fibrillation and beginning to prepare the defibrillator, more specifically the time between end of preparation of the defibrillator and actual delivery of the shock, with a mean proportion of 26% (n = 49, SD = 17%) of the overall time needed for defibrillation (maximum 67%). Self-reported reasons for this delay included uncertainty about the next step to take, as reported by 73% of the participants. A total of 35% were unsure about which algorithm to follow. Diagnosing the patient was subjectively difficult for 35% of the participants. Overall, 53% of the participants felt generally confused. Conclusions Our study shows that novice resuscitators rarely achieve guideline-recommended defibrillation times. The most relative delays were observed when participants had to choose what to do next or which algorithm to follow, and thus i.e. performed extensive airway management before a life-saving defibrillation. Our data provides a first insight in the process of defibrillation delay and can be used to generate new hypotheses on how to provide a timely defibrillation."
HUMAN PATIENT SIMULATORS IN NURSING STUDENTS TRAINING,"ICERI2015: 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION","This paper presents an overview of the use of human patient simulators in the training of nursing students in the College of Nursing at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). The College houses a sixteen bed hospital laboratory, a four bed obstetric/pediatric laboratory and five high-fidelity simulation laboratories with examining rooms, facilitator control rooms and student/faculty debriefing rooms. Human patient simulators have been used for over forty years in medical education. Almost every nursing school in the U.S. now uses some form of human patient simulators in nursing training to improve deeper physiological and pathophysiological understanding, clinical judgment, critical thinking and clinical reasoning. This paper describes the new Center, its facilities and human patient simulators and the use of these simulators in training nursing students."
eBSim: Development of a Low-Cost Obstetric Simulator,"AUGMENTED REALITY, VIRTUAL REALITY, AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS, PT II","This work presents the design a low cost obstetric simulator allowing precise identification of the fetal position in a simulated birth canal. The system consists on a female pelvis, a custom-made fetal mannequin, a virtual 3d representation, a visual display and an user interface to show in real time what happens inside the birth canal. Students are often unable not only to identify correctly the fetal head position, but also to discriminate between the two fontanels, for this reason the simulator eBSim can help them to train this ability and could be an important instrument for the instructors to objectively assess the clinical skill of each student."
Anesthesiologist Management of Perioperative Do-Not-Resuscitate Orders: A Simulation-Based Experiment,SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE,"Introduction: This study was performed to assess perioperative reevaluation of Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) orders by practicing anesthesiologists. Methods: As part of an Anesthesia Crisis Resource Management course, an anesthesiologist interviewed a patient-actor with prostate cancer and bone metastases scheduled for a central venous catheter placement. The chart included a properly documented DNR order and the patient-actor's scripted responses emphasized that he would accept resuscitative efforts only if the adverse clinical events were believed to be both temporary and reversible. Later, the subject assumed responsibility for the anesthesia in which the patient subsequently developed an iatrogenically induced pneumothorax, became apneic, and had a cardiovascular arrest requiring a prolonged resuscitation. Responses to these events and a following survey were evaluated. Results: Fifty-seven percent of the subjects (17/30) addressed resuscitation during the preoperative interview; 27% (8/30) decided to suspend the DNR order and 30% (9/30) instituted a goal-directed or procedure-directed DNR order. Ninety percent (27/30) of the groups chose to continue resuscitative efforts until the simulation ended. Of the surveyed participants, over 90% would place a chest tube, intubate the trachea, do chest compressions, and perform cardiac defibrillation. Common reasons for intervening were reversibility, iatrogenicity, and that intervention would be consistent with the patient's goals. Conclusions: Inadequacies in perioperative reevaluation of DNR orders existed at all stages. Simulation of perioperative DNR orders is a useful way to elicit anesthesiologist's actions in the heat of the moment, which may bring us closer to understanding the actions of anesthesiologists during clinical practice.

Mystery shopping in health service evaluation,BRITISH JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE,"Background. Over the last 5 years, primary care telephone triage systems have been introduced in the United Kingdom, united States, Australia, and most recently in New Zealand Evaluation of the clinical safety of such systems poses a challenge for health planners and researchers Aim: To evaluate the use of simulated patients in the assessment of aspects of clinical safety in a pilot New Zealand primary care telephone triage service Design of study: 'Mystery shopping', an evaluation strategy commonly used in market research, was adapted by using simulated paitents for telephone triage service evaluation. Setting. New Zealand. Methods. Four scripted clinical scenarios were developed by academic general practitioners, validated in student teaching situations, and then used by simulated patients to make 101 telephone calls. The scenarios were designed to necessitate a referral to a medical practitioner for further investigation. The documentation kept by the callers was compared with the call records from the telephone triage company, and both were analysed for capture and handling of the clinical safety features of each scenario. In cases where the endpoint was not a medical assessment possible reasons for this were explored Results: Records were retrieved for 85 telephone calls. Considerable triage variability was discovered. There were discrepancies between expected and actual triage outcomes with 51% of analysed calls resulting in a self-care recommendation. A number of reasons were identified both for the triage variability and the unpredicted outcomes. Audiotaping of consultations would have enhanced the credibility of the evaluation but it would have carried ethical constraints. Conclusion: Simulated patients can be used to evaluate the limitations of health services and to identify areas that could be addressed to improve patient safety. Evaluation of patient satisfaction with services is not sufficient alone to evaluate safety."
Cost-effectiveness of olanzapine long-acting injection in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia in the United States: a micro-simulation economic decision model,CURRENT MEDICAL RESEARCH AND OPINION,"To compare, from the perspective of third-party payers in the United States health care system, the cost-effectiveness of olanzapine long-acting injection (LAI, depot) with alternative antipsychotic agents including risperidone-LAI, paliperidone-LAI, haloperidol-LAI, and oral olanzapine, in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia who have been non-adherent or partially adherent with oral antipsychotics. A 1-year micro-simulation economic decision model was developed to simulate the dynamics of usual care of patients with schizophrenia who continue, discontinue, switch, or restart their medication. The model uses a range of clinical and cost parameters including adherence levels, relapse with and without hospitalization, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), treatment discontinuation rates by reason, treatment-emergent adverse events, suicide, health care resource utilization, and direct health care costs. Published medical literature and a clinical expert panel were used to develop baseline model assumptions. Key model outputs include annual total direct cost (US$$) per treatment and incremental cost-effectiveness values per additional QALY gained. Model results found that the olanzapine-LAI treatment strategy was more effective (greater QALYs) and less costly than risperidone-LAI, paliperidone-LAI, and haloperidol-LAI. In addition, olanzapine-LAI was both more effective and more costly, with an estimated incremental cost/QALY of $$26,824 compared to oral olanzapine. The base-case and multiple sensitivity analyses found olanzapine-LAI to remain within acceptable cost-effective ranges (<$$50,000) in terms of incremental cost/QALY gained. This micro-simulation model finds the olanzapine-LAI treatment strategy to result in better effectiveness and to be a cost-effective alternative compared to oral olanzapine and the LAI formulations of risperidone, paliperidone, and haloperidol in the treatment of non-adherent and partially adherent patients with schizophrenia in the United States. A key limitation is the assumption how LAI therapies compare to oral counterparts due to sparse head-to-head data. Further research is needed to verify baseline assumptions."
"Effect of a limited-enforcement intelligent tutoring system in dermatopathology on student errors, goals and solution paths",ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE,"Objectives: Determine effects of a limited-enforcement intelligent tutoring system in dermatopathology on student errors, goals and solution paths. Determine if limited enforcement in a medical tutoring system inhibits students from (earning the optimal and most efficient solution path. Describe the type of deviations from the optimal solution path that occur during tutoring, and how these deviations change over time. Determine if the size of the problem-space (domain scope), has an effect on (earning gains when using a tutor with limited enforcement. Methods: Analyzed data mined from 44 pathology residents using SlideTutor-a Medical Intelligent Tutoring System in Dermatopathology that teaches histopathologic diagnosis and reporting skills based on commonly used diagnostic algorithms. Two subdomains were included in the study representing sub-algorithms of different sizes and complexities. Effects of the tutoring system on student errors, goat states and solution paths were determined. Results: Students gradually increase the frequency of steps that match the tutoring system's expectation of expert performance. Frequency of errors gradually declines in all categories of error significance. Student performance frequently differs from the tutor-defined optimal path. However, as students continue to be tutored, they approach the optimal solution path. Performance in both subdomains was similar for both errors and goal differences. However, the rate at which students progress toward the optimal solution path differs between the two domains. Tutoring in superficial perivascular dermatitis, the larger and more complex domain was associated with a slower rate of approximation towards the optimal solution path. Conclusions: Students benefit from a limited-enforcement tutoring system that leverages diagnostic algorithms but does not prevent alternative strategies. Even with limited enforcement, students converge toward the optimal solution path. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V."
Phosphodiesterase 10 inhibitors in clinical development for CNS disorders,EXPERT REVIEW OF NEUROTHERAPEUTICS,"Introduction: Phosphodiesterase 10 inhibitors (PDE10-I), are conceptually attractive drugs with a potential great therapeutic window as their enriched striatal localization may likely stimulate D1R and reduce D2R downstream effects. However, so far selective PDE10-I with efficacy in animal models have not shown benefit in clinical trials and unexpectedly revealed a substantial dyskinesia motor side-effect.Areas covered: This paper reviews the underlying biological rationale of PDE10 as a target in schizophrenia, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease based on peer-reviewed published articles, the status of the different PDE10-I in clinical development for various CNS indications and explores possible reasons for the clinical trial failures and translational disconnect.Expert commentary: Possible explanations include non-optimal dose and titration schedule, but more importantly the differential non-linear pharmacodynamic interactions with individual comedications, the species difference in underlying neurobiology and the differences with the rich pharmacology of successful antipsychotics. The authors also present optogenetics, DREADD (Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug) technology, organoids based on iPSC (induced Pluripotent Stem Cells) and advanced computer modeling and simulation as possible new technologies to further elucidate the complex nature of the emergent properties of key neuronal circuits that drive human behavior."
Are Simulation Stethoscopes a Useful Adjunct for Emergency Residents' Training on High-fidelity Mannequins?,WESTERN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE,"Introduction: Emergency medicine residents use simulation training for many reasons, such as gaining experience with critically ill patients and becoming familiar with disease processes. Residents frequently criticize simulation training using current high-fidelity mannequins due to the poor quality of physical exam findings present, such as auscultatory findings, as it may lead them down an alternate diagnostic or therapeutic pathway. Recently wireless remote programmed stethoscopes (simulation stethoscopes) have been developed that allow wireless transmission of any sound to a stethoscope receiver, which improves the fidelity of a physical examination and the simulation case. Methods: Following institutional review committee approval, 14 PGY1-3 emergency medicine residents were assessed during 2 simulation-based cases using pre-defined scoring anchors on multiple actions, such as communication skills and treatment decisions (Appendix 1). Each case involved a patient presenting with dyspnea requiring management based off physical examination findings. One case was a patient with exacerbation of heart failure, while the other was a patient with a tension pneumothorax. Each resident was randomized into a case associated with the simulation stethoscope. Following the cases residents were asked to fill out an evaluation questionnaire. Results: Residents perceived the most realistic physical exam findings on those associated with the case using the simulation stethoscope (13/14, 93%). Residents also preferred the simulation stethoscope as an adjunct to the case (13/14, 93%), and they rated the simulation stethoscope case to have significantly more realistic auscultatory findings (4.4/5 vs. 3.0/5 difference of means 1.4, p=0.0007). Average scores of residents were significantly better in the simulation stethoscopeassociated case (2.5/3 vs. 2.3/3 difference of means 0.2, p=0.04). There was no considerable difference in the total time taken per case. Conclusion: A simulation stethoscope may be a useful adjunct to current emergency medicine simulation- based training. Residents both preferred the use of the simulation stethoscope and perceived physical exam findings to be more realistic, leading to improved fidelity. Potential sources of bias include the small population, narrow scoring range, and the lack of blinding. Further research, focusing on use for resident assessment and clinical significance with a larger population and blinding of graders, is needed."
Medical Student and Tutor Perceptions of Video Versus Text in an Interactive Online Virtual Patient for Problem-Based Learning: A Pilot Study,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,"Background: The impact of the use of video resources in primarily paper-based problem-based learning (PBL) settings has been widely explored. Although it can provide many benefits, the use of video can also hamper the critical thinking of learners in contexts where learners are developing clinical reasoning. However, the use of video has not been explored in the context of interactive virtual patients for PBL. Objective: A pilot study was conducted to explore how undergraduate medical students interpreted and evaluated information from video-and text-based materials presented in the context of a branched interactive online virtual patient designed for PBL. The goal was to inform the development and use of virtual patients for PBL and to inform future research in this area. Methods: An existing virtual patient for PBL was adapted for use in video and provided as an intervention to students in the transition year of the undergraduate medicine course at St George's, University of London. Survey instruments were used to capture student and PBL tutor experiences and perceptions of the intervention, and a formative review meeting was run with PBL tutors. Descriptive statistics were generated for the structured responses and a thematic analysis was used to identify emergent themes in the unstructured responses. Results: Analysis of student responses (n=119) and tutor comments (n=18) yielded 8 distinct themes relating to the perceived educational efficacy of information presented in video and text formats in a PBL context. Although some students found some characteristics of the videos beneficial, when asked to express a preference for video or text the majority of those that responded to the question (65%, 65/100) expressed a preference for text. Student responses indicated that the use of video slowed the pace of PBL and impeded students' ability to review and critically appraise the presented information. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that text was perceived to be a better source of information than video in virtual patients for PBL. More specifically, the use of video was perceived as beneficial for providing details, visual information, and context where text was unable to do so. However, learner acceptance of text was higher in the context of PBL, particularly when targeting clinical reasoning skills. This pilot study has provided the foundation for further research into the effectiveness of different virtual patient designs for PBL."
Leading teams during simulated pediatric emergencies: a pilot study,ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND PRACTICE,"Purpose: Leadership has been identified as a key variable for the functioning of teams and as one of the main reasons for success or failure of team-based work systems. Pediatricians often function as team leaders in the resuscitation of a critically ill child. However, pediatric residents often report having little opportunity to perform in the role of team leader during residency. In order to gain more insight into leadership skills and behaviors, we classified leadership styles of pediatric residents during simulated emergencies. Methods: We conducted a prospective quantitative study to investigate leadership styles used by pediatric residents during simulated emergencies with clinical deterioration of a child at a pediatric ward. Using videotaped scenarios of 48 simulated critical events among 12 residents, we were able to classify verbal and nonverbal communication into different leadership styles according to the situational leadership theory. Results: The coaching style (mean 54.5%, SD 7.8) is the most frequently applied by residents, followed by the directing style (mean 35.6%, SD 4.1). This pattern conforms to the task-and role-related requirements in our scenarios and it also conforms to the concept of situational leadership. We did not find any significant differences in leadership style according to the postgraduate year or scenario content. Conclusion: The model used in this pilot study helps us to gain a better understanding of the development of effective leadership behavior and supports the applicability of situational leadership theory in training leadership skills during residency."
"Learner preferences regarding integrating, sequencing and aligning virtual patients with other activities in the undergraduate medical curriculum: A focus group study",MEDICAL TEACHER,"Context: E-learning resources, such as virtual patients (VPs), can be more effective when they are integrated in the curriculum. To gain insights that can inform guidelines for the curricular integration of VPs, we explored students' perceptions of scenarios with integrated and non-integrated VPs aimed at promoting clinical reasoning skills. Methods: During their paediatric clerkship, 116 fifth-year medical students were given at least ten VPs embedded in eight integrated scenarios and as non-integrated add-ons. The scenarios differed in the sequencing and alignment of VPs and related educational activities, tutor involvement, number of VPs, relevance to assessment and involvement of real patients. We sought students' perceptions on the VP scenarios in focus group interviews with eight groups of 4-7 randomly selected students (n = 39). The interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed qualitatively. Results: The analysis resulted in six themes reflecting students' perceptions of important features for effective curricular integration of VPs: (i) continuous and stable online access, (ii) increasing complexity, adapted to students' knowledge, (iii) VP-related workload offset by elimination of other activities, (iv) optimal sequencing (e.g.: lecture -1 to 2 VP(s) - tutor-led small group discussion - real patient) and (V) optimal alignment of VPs and educational activities, (vi) inclusion of VP topics in assessment. Conclusions: The themes appear to offer starting points for the development of a framework to guide the curricular integration of VPs. Their impact needs to be confirmed by studies using quantitative controlled designs."
Models for guideline representation,NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES,"Despite the great emphasis that the medical community has dedicated to clinical practice guidelines in the last few decades, it has become clear that it is difficult to adequately distribute texts (paper-based guidelines) and for them to be used by final users. The reasons for this are manifold: the large number of guidelines delivered each year, their necessary updates on the face of new scientific evidence, the text is not always free from ambiguities, etc. When these problems became evident, the medical informatics community hypothesised that more formal electronic versions would increase the probability of the effective diffusion of guidelines and also physicians' compliance to them. This claim was based on a few hypotheses: one is that formal models, such as flowcharts or other graphical metaphors, provide a more friendly and immediate way of reading a guideline, thus improving learning and absorbing of the guideline content (e.g. using formal models as educational/simulation tools); another hypothesis is that formal models allow easier guideline integration with the daily clinical workflow, raising the possibility of building real-time decision support systems, which again should improve physicians' compliance. This paper focuses on the issues that must be taken into account when modelling guidelines to ensure their effective implementation in real-world computerised environments."
Exercise physiology in left ventricular assist device patients: insights from hemodynamic simulations,ANNALS OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY,"Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) assure longer survival to patients, but exercise capacity is limited compared to normal values. Overall, LVAD patients show high wedge pressure and low cardiac output during maximal exercise, a phenomenon hinting at the need for increased LVAD support. Clinical studies investigating the hemodynamic benefits of an LVAD speed increase during exercise, ended in inhomogeneous and sometimes contradictory results. The native ventricle- LVAD interaction changes between rest and exercise, and this evolution is complex, multifactorial and patient-specific. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview on the patient-LVAD interaction during exercise and to delineate possible therapeutic strategies for the future. A computational cardiorespiratory model was used to simulate the hemodynamics of peak bicycle exercise in LVAD patients. The simulator included the main cardiovascular and respiratory impairments commonly observed in LVAD patients, so as to represent an average hemodynamic response to exercise. In addition, other exercise responses were simulated, by tuning the chronotropic, inotropic and vascular functions, and implementing aortic regurgitation and stenosis in the simulator. These profiles were tested under different LVAD speeds and LVAD pressure-flow characteristics. Simulations output showed consistency with clinical data from the literature. The simulator allowed the working condition of the assisted ventricle at exercise to be investigated, clarifying the reasons behind the high wedge pressure and poor cardiac output observed in the clinics. Patients with poorer inotropic, chronotropic and vascular functions, are likely to benefit more from an LVAD speed increase during exercise. Similarly, for these patients, a flatter LVAD pressure-flow characteristic can assure better hemodynamic support under physical exertion. Overall, the study evidenced the need for a patient-specific approach on supporting exercise hemodynamics. In this frame, a complex simulator can constitute a valuable tool to define and test personalized speed control algorithms and strategies."
Development and evaluation of a telehealth-based simulation to improve breastfeeding education and skills among nursing students,NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE,"Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate undergraduate nursing students' perceptions of using telehealth-based simulations for practicing their breastfeeding education skills. Background: Telehealth can help bridge the gap between the high need for healthcare services and the limited access to these services, such as breastfeeding mothers in rural settings. However current literature suggests that there is lack of telehealth education among healthcare providers, as well as, a shortage of adequately trained nurses on breastfeeding, making it difficult to provide new mothers with the support they need to successfully breastfeed. Telehealth simulation has shown to be acceptable and helpful in teaching clinical reasoning, increasing exposure to telehealth experiences, and preparing nursing students for real interaction experiences with patients. Design: For this cross-sectional descriptive study, two breastfeeding telehealth simulation scenarios were developed and delivered through Zoom for Bachelor of Science in Nursing students in a high-level institution in Florida. Selected students interacted over Zoom as healthcare providers with a female simulated patient who played as a mother with a breastfeeding concern. Students in their role of healthcare providers assessed the breastfeeding needs of the mother and conducted breastfeeding education as appropriate. After debriefing, students received feedback from faculty and students who observed the simulation and completed an optional evaluation about their telehealth simulated experience. Results: A total of 205 students completed the evaluation. Most students (n = 136, 66.3%) were not familiar with telehealth prior to the simulation. Most students (n = 199, 97.1%) also found the simulation helpful for supporting breastfeeding mothers and wanted more telehealth simulations in the future (n = 162, 79%). Feedback for improving the simulations included: improving the technical setup (n = 17, 8.3%), increasing the time that students interacted with the mother (n = 16, 7.8%), and observing the correct performance of the simulation after debriefing (n = 16, 7.8%). Conclusion: Telehealth simulation is a promising modality for clinical competency assessment, thus it is essential to integrate telehealth education into nursing curriculum. It is evident that telehealth-based breastfeeding simulations can be used to address the exposure/knowledge gap among nursing students who are missing or have limited exposure to breastfeeding content and telehealth use in their nursing curriculum."
Mass casualty education for undergraduate nursing students in Australia,NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE,"With the increasing risk of mass casualty incidents from extreme climate events, global terrorism, pandemics and nuclear incidents, it's important to prepare nurses with skills and knowledge necessary to manage such incidents. There are very few documented accounts of the inclusion of mass casualty education within undergraduate nursing programs. This paper is the first to describe undergraduate mass casualty nursing education in Australia. A final year Bachelor of Nursing undergraduate subject was developed. The subject focused on initial treatment and stabilisation of casualties predominantly within pre-hospital environments, and included a capstone inter professional mass casualty simulation. Students experience of the subject was evaluated using the Satisfaction with Simulation Experience Scale (Levett-Jones et al., 2011) and a subject evaluation survey. Student satisfaction and evaluations were extremely positive. As a tool for developing clinical skills, 93% (n = 43) agreed that the simulation developed their clinical reasoning and decision making skills. In particular, the simulation enabled students to apply what they had learned (77%, n = 35, strongly agree). Due to the frequency of mass casualty events worldwide, there is a need for educational exposure in undergraduate nursing curricula. We believe that this mass casualty education could be used as a template for development in nursing curricula."
Feedback in formative OSCEs: comparison between direct observation and video-based formats,MEDICAL EDUCATION ONLINE,"Introduction: Medical students at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Switzerland, have the opportunity to practice clinical skills with simulated patients during formative sessions in preparation for clerkships. These sessions are given in two formats: 1) direct observation of an encounter followed by verbal feedback (direct feedback) and 2) subsequent review of the videotaped encounter by both student and supervisor (video-based feedback). The aim of the study was to evaluate whether content and process of feedback differed between both formats. Methods: In 2013, all second-and third-year medical students and clinical supervisors involved in formative sessions were asked to take part in the study. A sample of audiotaped feedback sessions involving supervisors who gave feedback in both formats were analyzed (content and process of the feedback) using a 21-item feedback scale. Results: Forty-eight audiotaped feedback sessions involving 12 supervisors were analyzed (2 direct and 2 video-based sessions per supervisor). When adjusted for the length of feedback, there were significant differences in terms of content and process between both formats; the number of communication skills and clinical reasoning items addressed were higher in the video-based format (11.29 vs. 7.71, p = 0.002 and 3.71 vs. 2.04, p = 0.010, respectively). Supervisors engaged students more actively during the video-based sessions than during direct feedback sessions (self-assessment: 4.00 vs. 3.17, p = 0.007; active problem-solving: 3.92 vs. 3.42, p = 0.009). Students made similar observations and tended to consider that the video feedback was more useful for improving some clinical skills. Conclusion: Video-based feedback facilitates discussion of clinical reasoning, communication, and professionalism issues while at the same time actively engaging students. Different time and conceptual frameworks may explain observed differences. The choice of feedback format should depend on the educational goal."
Analysis of vismodegib resistance in D473G and W535L mutants of SMO receptor and design of novel drug derivatives using molecular dynamics simulations,LIFE SCIENCES,"Aims: Vismodegib is an effective antagonist of smoothened receptors for treatment of locally advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma. However, it often suffers from drug resistance due to mutations. Two common mutants, D473(6.55)G and W535(7.55)L, were found to cause serious drug resistance. Although the reduction of drug binding affinity (similar to 40-fold) was thought to be the major reasons, the detailed structural, energetic and dynamic mechanisms at the molecular level are still unknown. Main methods: Molecular dynamics simulations and molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) binding energy calculations were performed on three complex systems of wild-type (WT) and two mutants with vismodegib. Then, virtual screening was used to select three potential derivatives of vismodegib from the 7(7) new derivatives designed by modifying the substitutions on the phenylpyridine ring of vismodegib. Key findings: The MM-GBSA binding energy data of the two mutants showed a significant reduction in binding affinity. The energy decomposition identified that the key contributing residues were in the binding site. The D473(6.55)G mutant affected the binding of the ligand by directly changing the conformations of the key residues in TM6, while the W535(7.55)L mutant mainly depended on long range allosteric effect. More importantly, the methylsulfonyl benzamide moiety was identified to be the pharmacophore of the ligand, and two of the three derivatives from the virtual screening showed much higher MM-GBSA binding affinity to the two mutants than vismodegib did. Significance: These results might help to understand resistance mechanisms and the two derivatives can be good candidates for future experiments."
The Effect of Serious Games for Nursing Students in Clinical Decision-Making Process: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,GAMES FOR HEALTH JOURNAL,"Background: Serious games (SGs) have been proposed as a type of technology-enhanced simulation that may provide nursing students with an opportunity to practice their clinical reasoning and decision-making skills in a realistic and safe environment.Materials and Methods: The aim of this study is to determine the effect of serious play on nursing students' self-confidence (SC) and anxiety in clinical decision making. The randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of SGs for undergraduate nursing students using pre- and posttests. The study was conducted during nursing students' clinical practice and teaching. All undergraduate nursing students (n = 120) attending internal medicine nursing lesson were approached. Sixty students out of 120 answered the questionnaires at both baseline and follow-up (30 in the experimental group [EG] and 30 in the control group). The students answered the questionnaire after taking the first clinical practice, taking the endocrine course. In the 1 week, the EG played the game and both groups returned to clinical practice. Questionnaire data were collected after clinical application.Results: SC and two subdimensions, using the information in hand to determine the problem, and knowing and taking action, were improved in the intervention group and a significant interaction effect was found for changes over time between the two groups. Anxiety scores between groups were not statistically significant differences.Conclusions: Nursing professional educators can adopt SGs to improve cognitive and attention skills, strengthen judgment, require making time efficient, practice making safe decisions, and encourage the exploration of decision."
PATIENT-INDIVIDUAL HIP CUPS: SIMULATION-BASED DESIGN AND SHEET METAL FORMING MANUFACTURING,BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING-BIOMEDIZINISCHE TECHNIK,"The revision of an hip prosthesis can have diffrent reasons. One frequent cause, especialley after implantation of a conventional cup, is the so called stress-shielding effect which can lead to a migration or loosening. Patient-specific hip cups can be used to counteract this. However, individual hip cups are only implanted for the treatment of great deformations or tumours because of the cost-intensive manufacturing. Within this project a patient-specific hip cup prosthesis has to be developed and manufactured. Besides the numerical design by means of a coupling between multi-body simulation (MBS) and finite element method (FEM), an inovative concept for the production of patient-individual hip prosthesis out of titanium sheets is introduced in this study."
Integration of Virtual Patients in Education of Veterinary Medicine,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2017 FEDERATED CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS (FEDCSIS),"Problem based learning, utilizing simulations and virtual reality tools represents one of the approaches integrated into the education of medicine to prepare medical students for both the bedside teaching and their later clinical praxis. On the other side, implementation of innovative didactic materials may be useful also for veterinary medicine students. Thus, veterinary topics can be introduced and explained in the form of virtual cases, helping students to understand relationships between theory and practical application of their decisions. Simulations and virtual cases are also used to assess students' clinical reasoning skills. Therefore, our work is aimed on integration of modern simulation tools into education process at University of veterinary medicine and pharmacy in Kosice, Slovakia. Inspired by our colleagues from Faculty of Medicine in Kosice and respecting our requirements we were able to specify appropriate methods and to introduce the first veterinary virtual patient to our students."
Hazard ratio estimation and inference in clinical trials with many tied event times,STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,"The medical literature contains numerous examples of randomized clinical trials with time-to-event endpoints in which large numbers of events accrued over relatively short follow-up periods, resulting in many tied event times. A generally common feature across such examples was that the logrank test was used for hypothesis testing and the Cox proportional hazards model was used for hazard ratio estimation. We caution that this common practice is particularly risky in the setting of many tied event times for two reasons. First, the estimator of the hazard ratio can be severely biased if the Breslow tie-handling approximation for the Cox model (the default in SAS and Stata software) is used. Second, the 95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio can include one even when the corresponding logrank test p-value is less than 0.05. To help establish a better practice, with applicability for both superiority and noninferiority trials, we use theory and simulations to contrast Wald and score tests based on well-known tie-handling approximations for the Cox model. Our recommendation is to report the Wald test p-value and corresponding confidence interval based on the Efron approximation. The recommended test is essentially as powerful as the logrank test, the accompanying point and interval estimates of the hazard ratio have excellent statistical properties even in settings with many tied event times, inferential alignment between the p-value and confidence interval is guaranteed, and implementation is straightforward using commonly used software."
A Springboard for physicians returning to practice,CLINICAL TEACHER,"Background: Many physicians take time out of training and have decreased confidence and poor performance ratings on their return. Courses employing multiple educational methods have been shown to be effective in easing learners into new clinical roles during transition periods but, to date, there is limited evidence for courses to support trainees returning to practice (RTP). Methods: A 2-day course, named Springboard, was developed, specifically to address the needs of trainee physicians RTP. It employed a blended, multi-modal approach to learning, including lectures, workshops, case-based sessions, interactive panel discussions, small group teaching, peer-led practical advice sessions and simulation training. Springboard was delivered eight times between 2014 and 2019 with a total of 540 doctors attending. We analysed participant pre-and post-course questionnaire feedback. Results: Reasons for doctors taking time out of training included parental leave, research, fellowships in education and leadership, health-related absence and career breaks. Time out of training ranged between 3 months and 6 years. A significant pre/post-course increase in candidates' self-reported leadership skills and confidence in being prepared to return to practice was demonstrated alongside an appreciation of a multi-modal, 'boot camp' course delivered by expert faculty and a networking experience. Discussion: Dedicated training courses tailored to the needs of physicians RTP provide an opportunity for improving confidence relating to many areas of clinical and non-clinical practice as well as providing an environment for networking and sharing experiences. Further work would be valuable to establish the potential of providing this on a larger scale."
The Future of Onboarding Implementation of Immersive Virtual Reality for Nursing Clinical Assessment Training,JOURNAL FOR NURSES IN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT,"An immersive virtual reality curriculum was piloted with new nurse graduates that focused on improving clinical reasoning and situational awareness for pediatric respiratory distress and impending respiratory failure.

Marginal accuracy of combined tooth-implant-supported fixed dental prostheses after in vitro stress simulation,CLINICAL ORAL IMPLANTS RESEARCH,"Caries, periodontal disease, and peri-implant inflammation caused by deficient marginal adaptation of fixed prostheses are reasons for clinical failure of combined tooth-implant-supported fixed dental prostheses (TISFDP). This in vitro study examined the marginal accuracy in TISFDP after simulated stress in an artificial oral environment. Twelve three-unit TISFDPs were fabricated using a high noble alloy on models containing a human premolar with an artificial periodontium and an implant. Four three-unit tooth-supported prostheses (TSFDP) represented the control group. The experimental TISFDPs (four per group) were luted with three different cements: group 1, zinc phosphate; group 2, glass ionomer; group 3, self-adhesive resin. The specimens were mechanically loaded (1.2 million cycles/50 N) and thermally cycled (8000 cycles with 5/55 degrees C). The vertical marginal gap was measured before and after cementation, after chewing simulation and after thermal cycling by light microscopy (x 560). The results were subjected to statistical analysis (t-test/one-way analysis of variance/Bonferroni). Significant increase (P <= 0.05) in the marginal gap was found after cementation within the experimental TISFDPs (implants, 11.7-18.7 mu m; teeth, 13.4-24.2 mu m) and the control TSFDPs (28.5 mu m). Comparison of groups 1 and 2 revealed significant differences for the teeth while comparison of the implants showed significant differences among all groups. Chewing simulation and thermal cycling caused statistically insignificant changes in the marginal gaps of the experimental as well as the control TSFDPs. The cementation of the TISFDPs with different luting materials caused a specific enlargement of the marginal gap in teeth and implants. Subsequent to simulated oral stress in an artificial oral environment, no significant changes of the marginal accuracy could be found.

Critical Thinking in Health Sciences and How It Pertains to Sonography Education: A Review of the Literature,JOURNAL OF DIAGNOSTIC MEDICAL SONOGRAPHY,"Objective: Critical thinking is an important skill that sonographers must develop beginning in educational programs and into professional practice. Critical thinking requires students to reflect on information, use judgment skills, and engage in higher levels of thinking, including analysis, interpretation, inference, evaluation, and explanation, to formulate reliable decisions. Methods: Current research related to critical thinking has focused on medicine, nursing, physical therapy, pharmacy, and dental programs, but there has been no description of assessing sonography students. The Dreyfus model has been used as a framework to describe acquired skills that reflects students' progress from novice to expert clinicians. This model illustrates specific cognitive abilities that students develop as they advance in education. Results: This review of the literature describes critical thinking skills coupled with a framework to understand different levels of cognitive thinking, as well as how it can be assessed. Conclusion: To understand differences between undergraduate sonography students and experts, the Dreyfus model is an excellent model to recognize progression. It can be used with the Health Sciences Reasoning Test, which is a nationally recognized critical thinking examination that can ascertain different levels of health sciences students' critical thinking skills."
Combination of simulation-based and online learning in ophthalmology Efficiency of simulation in combination with independent online learning within the framework of EyesiNet in student education,OPHTHALMOLOGE,"Background Ophthalmoscopy is part of the medical curriculum but the teaching of medical contents is often unsatisfactory. No systematic learning of pathologies and their treatment options is possible because appropriate patient populations are often unavailable; instead of that healthy students examine each other. For this reason, we have developed a project to improve teaching at the medical faculty of the JWG University in Frankfurt/Main, which offers the opportunity for training in ophthalmoscopy using a newly developed online platform (EyesiNet) in addition to simulator training. Defined learning contents are reproducible and made equally available to everyone. Aim The aim of this study was to evaluate a format for improving the teaching of direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy for students. Practical exercises on virtual reality-based simulators were intertwined with newly developed theoretical content adapted to the teaching catalog in the online platform EyesiNet. Material and methods On the first and last days of the internship, the students worked on cases in Eyesi Direct and Eyesi Indirect. In the meantime, they were able to deal with the theoretical basics of these ophthalmological clinical pictures in the web-based EyesiNet on a voluntary basis. Results Eyesi Direct: with p = 0.29, both groups had the same state of knowledge and did not have significantly different results in case processing on the first day of the internship. In the group without training (n = 54), a significant improvement in simulator training was observed on the last day of the practical training with p = 0.02 but with a small effect size of 0.1. Among the trainees (n = 32) a highly significant improvement with an effect size of 0.3 was observed with p = 0.0004. Eyesi Indirect: both groups had no significant difference in the stage of knowledge in the Eyesi Indirect at the beginning of the training period (p = 0.10). After training both groups performed slightly better but without significance (without training p = 0.41/with training p = 0.17). Conclusion The online platform EyesiNet supports the learning of the most important disease patterns. Learning contents are made available in a reproducible and standardized way for all students. The skills of direct ophthalmoscopy can be learned much faster than those of indirect ophthalmoscopy."
Proactive versus reactive: the effect of experience on performance in a critical care simulator,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY,"Background: We sought to study the cognitive performance of residents in a critical care patient simulator. Methods: Residents in general surgery and emergency medicine were recruited to participate in the study. Subjects were read a morning report and presented with written data for 4 critical care patients. The subjects were evaluated on completing essential clinical tasks, cognitive errors, and directionality of reasoning. Results: Nine residents completed the study. Months of clinical residency training did not significantly affect performance. Residents with more than 10 weeks of intensive care unit (ICU) experience (EXP) made significantly fewer cognitive errors than those with less than 10 weeks of ICU experience (N-I) (EXP: 75 +/- .96 vs N-1: 7 +/- 5.6 errors per subject, P <.05). An unexpected finding was that EXP performed far more proactive actions than N-I (EXP: 21.8 +/- 9.9/subject vs N-1: 5.7 +/- .6/subjects, P <.01). Conclusions: A unique finding was that residents with more than 10 weeks of ICU experience initiated a large number of proactive actions immediately following presentation of patient information, while N-I rarely performed these actions. In addition, residents with this degree of experience committed significantly fewer cognitive errors. These differences might play a role in efficiency, cost, and overall outcome in the care of ICU patients. (c) 2007 Excerpta Medica Inc. All rights reserved."
Construction of a biological tissue model based on a single-cell model: A computer simulation of metabolic heterogeneity in the liver lobule,ARTIFICIAL LIFE,"An enormous body of information has been obtained by molecular and cellular biology in the last half century However, even these powerful approaches are not adequate when it comes to higher-level biological structures, such as tissues, organs, and individual organisms, because of the complexities involved. Thus, accumulation of data at the higher levels supports and broadens the context for that obtained on the molecular and cellular levels. Under such auspices, an attempt to elucidate mesoscopic and macroscopic Subjects based on plentiful nanoscopic and microscopic data is of great potential value. On the other hand, fully realistic simulation is impracticable because of the extensive cost entailed and enormous amount of data required. Abstraction and modeling that balance the dual requirements of prediction accuracy and manageable calculation cost are of great importance for systems biology We have constructed an ammonia metabolism model of the hepatic lobule, a histological component of the liver, based on a single-hepatocyte model that consists of the biochemical kinetics of enzymes and transporters. To bring the calculation cost within reason, the porto-central axis, which is an elemental structure of the lobule, is defined as the systems biological unit of the liver, and is accordingly modeled. A model including both histological structure and position-specific gene expression of major enzymes largely represents the physiological dynamics of the hepatic lobule in nature. In addition, heterogeneous gene expression is suggested to have evolved to optimize the energy efficiency of ammonia detoxification at the macroscopic level, implying that Approaches like this may elucidate how properties at the molecular and cellular levels, such as regulated gene expression, modify higher-level phenomena of multicellular tissue, organs, and organisms."
Joint modelling of longitudinal outcome and interval-censored competing risk dropout in a schizophrenia clinical trial,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY,". The Clinical antipsychotic trials in intervention effectiveness study was designed to evaluate whether there were significant differences between several antipsychotic medications in effectiveness, tolerability, cost and quality of life of subjects with schizophrenia. Overall, 74% of patients discontinued the study medication for various reasons before the end of 18 months in phase I of the study. When such a large percentage of study participants fail to complete the study schedule, it is not clear whether the apparent profile in effectiveness reflects genuine changes over time or is influenced by selection bias, with participants with worse (or better) outcome values being more likely to drop out or to discontinue. To assess the effect of dropouts for different reasons on inferences, we construct a joint model for the longitudinal outcome and cause-specific dropouts that allows for interval-censored dropout times. Incorporating the information regarding the cause of dropout improves inferences and provides better understanding of the association between cause-specific dropout and the outcome process. We use simulations to demonstrate the advantages of the joint modelling approach in terms of bias and efficiency."
A threshold causal model for clinical trials with departures from intended treatment,STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,"Randomized clinical trials often are planned to study a specific intervention. However, the collection of data on treatment actually received often reveals variable levels of treatment exposure (or 'dose') across subjects, due to non-compliance or other reasons, This paper presents a new method, using such 'dose' data as well as control group responses, to assess a causal dose-response relationship. The specific model utilizes a threshold function and incorporates a random effect term to allow for heterogeneous treatment responses among subjects. Further modelling of the random effects allows for reduction of error variance and control for potential confounders. The threshold dose is estimated using a residual variance criterion based on a transformed model. Estimates of standard errors and confidence intervals are obtained using a bootstrap procedure. The method is applied to data from an AIDS clinical trial. A simulation study demonstrates the adequacy of the threshold estimates for particular sample sizes and error variances. The limitations of this essentially exploratory method, as well as some possible extensions, are discussed. Published in 1999 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. This article is a US Government Work and is in the public domain in the United States."
TiMeDDx - A multi-phase anchor-based diagnostic decision-support model,JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS,"Main Clinical Manifestation (MCM)-oriented diagnosis starts with a chief problem and reasons about possible diagnoses that can be manifested in that way. The reasoning process often starts by considering abstract diagnosis groups (e.g., infectious vs. non-infectious diarrhea) and refines them. Most existing diagnostic decision-support systems (DSSs) are not specially tailored toward assisting non-expert physicians in the proper and efficient investigation workup of MCM-oriented diagnosis. We developed a Prototype diagnostic decision-support model called TiMeDDx that is MCM-oriented and follows the hypothetico-deductive Clinical reasoning process of differential diagnosis. The model guides users in a phase-by-phase manner regarding abstract diagnosis groups and diagnoses that should be considered and appropriate data that should be collected during the clinical investigation process. TiMeDDx's knowledge base contains, when possible, knowledge derived from MCM-oriented evidence-based sources. We explain the knowledge model and diagnostic algorithms (Bayesian and heuristic) of TiMeDDx, using the clinical problem of diarrhea as a case study, and contrast TiMeDDx with models of existing diagnostic DSSs.

Artifacts and Artistic Facts A Visual Simulation for Ultrasound Training,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION,"For innumerous reasons, ultrasound imaging is becoming more and more popular in musculoskeletal medicine. Herewith, because this imaging technique is user dependent, prompt and sufficient training is crucial for its better clinical utility. In this regard, with this article, we aimed to focus on common artifacts that are observed in routine ultrasound scanning during daily musculoskeletal practice. However, those imaging findings need to be well recognized not to be misinterpreted. Likewise, we have illustrated and discussed those artifacts in similarity with particular natural photographs. Rather than exemplifying with the same physical principles, our purpose was to provide visual analogy for better remembrance of these artifacts."
Competency-Based Methods in Adult Cardiac Sonography and its Application to Credentialing,JOURNAL OF DIAGNOSTIC MEDICAL SONOGRAPHY,"Objectives: This research examined the effects of multiple combined competency-based methods in an adult cardiac Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP) accredited diagnostic medical sonography program on clinical and didactic scores. Materials and Methods: A quasi-experimental nonequivalent group research design was used to evaluate students enrolled in an adult cardiac CAAHEP accredited echocardiography curriculum. Their cumulative final examination and clinical competency evaluation scores from multiple cohorts (pre- and post-intervention) were used for statistical analyses. Results: There were no significant differences between multiple competency-based assessments and didactic or clinical scores but unveiled reasons that coincide with the literature, such as nonvalid and subjective clinical assessment. Conclusion: These results suggest further evaluation of the credentialing process to ensure clinical competency."
ESR statement on new approaches to undergraduate teaching in Radiology,INSIGHTS INTO IMAGING,"Medical education is evolving and electronic learning (e-Learning) strategies have now become an essential asset in radiology education. Radiology education is a significant part of the undergraduate medical curriculum and the use of e-Learning in radiology teaching in medical schools is on the rise. If coupled with clinical decision support systems, e-Learning can be a practical way of teaching students clinical decision making, such as selecting the diagnostic imaging tests that are best suited in certain clinical scenarios. The innovative concept of flipped classroom learning encourages students to work independently and maximises the application of learnt contents in interactive classroom sessions. For integrated curricula with their student-centred, problem-based, and community-based design, an approach to systematically integrate radiology may be to define diagnostic reasoning as one of the core goals. Radiologists as teachers and scholars may understand themselves as experts in diagnostic reasoning and in mentoring how to make medical decisions. Computer programs simulating the routine work are available and can be used to teach the recognition of anatomical structures and pathological patterns, and also to teach ultrasonography and interventional radiology, maximising patient safety."
CORRELATION ANALYSIS OF A STRUCTURED OBJECTIVE CLINICAL EXAMINATION,EDULEARN16: 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES,"Introduction: Structured Objective Clinical Examination (OSCE) is an exam mode that has been developed and established to assess competencies in the upper reaches of the pyramid Miller (evaluation of executions). The reason for its popularity is that it represents a solution to the problems of getting a sampling and standardization of appropriated cases. This type of evaluation has been moving gradually to the long clinical cases as method for demonstrating clinical skills. It allows students to evaluate not only their knowledge but also skills and attitudes allowing self-assessment competence and thereby detecting areas for improvement in areas traditionally less evaluated, such as communication and technical skills, but key for clinical practice. Objectives: To check if there is significant correlation between the results of students in assessing knowledge with the results of assessment skills and attitudes. And to determine the degree of influence of previous academic records (global Bachelor, GB, and final of Pediatrics Classic marks) in the results, overall and by groups of skills, skills assessment in Pediatrics. Material and Methods: an objective structured clinical examination was designed and performed for students in 6th of Medicine enrolled in the course of pediatrics. It was divided into two periods, a first one of traditional training and a second one implementing new teaching methodologies through the virtual classroom, seminars simulation and a structured clinical rotation. Afterwards the same correlations between the marks obtained by students in the theoretical course of pediatrics, GB notes and the results of a competency examination were analyzed; and correlations between different skills, including knowledge assessment methodologies after distance education were also analyzed. Results: a strong correlation between the global marks and the Pediatrics Classic marks (r = 0.820, p < 0.0001) was observed. The mark obtained in the global OSCE correlate to a lower level with GB notes (r = 0.468, p < 0.0001) and Pediatric Classic (r = 0.424, p < 0.0001) and very similar in intensity, the correlation between global notes and notes Bachelor of Pediatrics Classic with knowledge assessment after a non-contact instruction (r = 0.516, p < 0.0001 and r = 0.462, p < 0.0001, respectively). When analyzing correlations between notes global OSCE with notes of groups of competencies that comprise it, relevant correlations are appreciated (knowledge r = 0.529; history-taking r = 0.596; communication: r = 0.557; Physical examination: r = 0.480; technical skills: r = 0.402 and management of clinical situations: r = 0.667) which, although decreasing in intensity, remain relevant to the study of partial correlations removing the effect of global degree notes. The study of correlations between the powers of OSCE shows significant correlation between history-taking and communication (r = 0.416) and between physical examination and management of clinical situations (r = 0.434), correlations remain as relevant in the study of correlation withdrawing in effect Bachelor notes (r = 0.369 and r = 0.386 respectively) Conclusions: Students, who score higher on classical degree programs, also obtained good scores in a program of educational innovation globally analyzed in all competences analyzed. At a lower level there is significant correlation between global notes Bachelor and Pediatrics Classic with the overall results of the competency assessment, but influenced by the overall results of Bachelor, since these correlations disappear by removing the effect of notes Bachelor. Competency evaluation marks were relevantly correlated with each of the competences it was made of, and relationship remains removing the effect of BA notes."
Guidance for setting easy-to-adopt competence criteria for optical diagnosis of diminutive colorectal polyps: a simulation approach,GASTROINTESTINAL ENDOSCOPY,"Background and Aims: One reason the optical diagnosis strategy for diminutive colorectal polyps has not yet been implemented is that the current competence criteria (Preservation and Incorporation of Valuable Endoscopic Innovation [PIVI] initiative) are difficult to use in daily practice. To provide guidance for setting alternative easy-to-adopt competence criteria, we determined the lowest proportion of diminutive polyps that should have a correct optical diagnosis to meet the PIVI. Methods: For this simulation study, we used datasets from 2 prospectively collected cohorts of patients who underwent colonoscopy in either a primary colonoscopy or fecal immunochemical test (FIT) screening setting. In the simulation approach, virtual endoscopists or computer-aided diagnosis systems performed optical diagnosis of diminutive polyps with a fixed diagnostic performance level (strategy) on all individuals in the cohort who had >= 1 diminutive polyp. Strategies were defined by systematically varying the proportion of correct optical diagnoses for each polyp subtype (ie, adenomas, hyperplastic polyps, sessile serrated lesions). For each strategy, we determined whether PIVI-1 (>= 90% agreement with U.S. or European Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy [ESGE] surveillance guidelines) and PIVI-2 (>= 90% negative predictive value [NPV] for neoplastic lesions in the rectosigmoid) were met using Monte Carlo sampling with 1000 repetitions, with histology as reference. Results: The level of overall diagnostic accuracy to achieve the PIVI differed significantly depending on the clinical setting and guidelines used. In the colonoscopy screening setting, all diagnostic strategies in which 92% of all diminutive polyps (regardless of histology) were diagnosed correctly led to 90% or more agreement with U.S. surveillance intervals (ie, PIVI-1). For all diagnostic strategies in which >= 89% of all diminutive polyps were correctly diagnosed, at least 90% NPV was achieved (ie, PIVI-2). For the FIT screening setting, values were respectively >= 77% and >= 94%. When using ESGE guidelines, PIVI-1 was in both settings already met when 40% of all diminutive polyps were diagnosed correctly. Conclusions: In contrast to the fixed PIVI criteria, our simulation study shows that different thresholds for the proportion of correctly diagnosed diminutive polyps lead to different clinical consequences depending on guidelines and clinical setting. However, this target proportion of diminutive colorectal polyps correctly diagnosed with optical diagnosis represents easier-to-adopt competence criteria."
Risk management in HIV/AIDS: ethical and economic issues associated with restricting HAART access only to adherent patients,AJAR-AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AIDS RESEARCH,"Like many other developing nations, South Africa faces the challenge of mobilising resources in response to the HIV pandemic. There is a large budget gap between the ideal and the actual amount of funding needed to achieve universal access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In addition to financial demands, new burdens are being placed on HAART programmes with the emergence of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR). Thus, a major threat to successful HAART rollout is HIVDR due to non-adherence to HAART. The use of HAART as a primary and secondary HIV-prevention strategy could be ineffective in situations characterised by high rates of non-adherence. In this context, the research looked at issues related to adherence and non-adherence to HAART from the perspective of the provider. Using the software TreeAge Pro 2009, we developed a Markov model to project economic outcomes for a hypothetical cohort of HIV/AIDS patients on HAART. The model compared two scenarios: adherence and non-adherence to HAART. Input data for the model was obtained from existing literature on HAART uptake in South Africa. Moral arguments were analysed and managed through moral reasoning and critical thinking. Discounted lifetime costs for adherent and non-adherent HAART patients in South Africa were estimated at US$9 771 and US$14 762, respectively. The model showed the loss of 4.55 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for non-adherent patients, which could be otherwise gained through improved adherence. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) indicated that restricting HAART access only to adherent patients was the dominant strategy. We suggest that, although not a panacea, the withholding or withdrawal of treatment from non-adherent individuals as a precautionary intervention has economic and moral merit."
A study on permanent magnet topologies for hybrid bearings for medical drives applied in Ventricular Assist Devices,ARCHIVES OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING,"In industrialized countries cardiovascular diseases are the major cause of death. The last clinical therapy option for some patients, suffering from terminal heart diseases, is donor heart transplantation. As the available number of donor organs is decreasing, many patients die while waiting for a transplant. For this reason Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs), which can mechanically support the human heart to achieve a sufficient perfusion of the body, are under development. For an implantable VAD, design constraints have to be deduced from the physiological conditions in the human body. In case of a VAD drive, these constraints are for example dimensions, electric losses, which might result in an overheating of blood, and a long durability. Therefore a hybrid permanent magnet hydrodynamic bearing is designed in this paper, which works passively and contactless. Based on Finite Element simulations of magnetic fields, various permanent magnet topologies are studied in terms of axial forces and stiffness."
New scoring methodology improves the sensitivity of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) in clinical trials,ALZHEIMERS RESEARCH & THERAPY,"Introduction: As currently used, the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) has low sensitivity for measuring Alzheimer's disease progression in clinical trials. A major reason behind the low sensitivity is its sub-optimal scoring methodology, which can be improved to obtain better sensitivity. Methods: Using item response theory, we developed a new scoring methodology (ADAS-CogIRT) for the ADAS-Cog, which addresses several major limitations of the current scoring methodology. The sensitivity of the ADAS-CogIRT methodology was evaluated using clinical trial simulations as well as a negative clinical trial, which had shown an evidence of a treatment effect. Results: The ADAS-Cog was found to measure impairment in three cognitive domains of memory, language, and praxis. The ADAS-CogIRT methodology required significantly fewer patients and shorter trial durations as compared to the current scoring methodology when both were evaluated in simulated clinical trials. When validated on data from a real clinical trial, the ADAS-CogIRT methodology had higher sensitivity than the current scoring methodology in detecting the treatment effect. Conclusions: The proposed scoring methodology significantly improves the sensitivity of the ADAS-Cog in measuring progression of cognitive impairment in clinical trials focused in the mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease stage. This provides a boost to the efficiency of clinical trials requiring fewer patients and shorter durations for investigating disease-modifying treatments."
Casebook: a virtual patient iPad application for teaching decision-making through the use of electronic health records,BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING,"Background: Virtual Patients are a well-known and widely used form of interactive software used to simulate aspects of patient care that students are increasingly less likely to encounter during their studies. However, to take full advantage of the benefits of using Virtual Patients, students should have access to multitudes of cases. In order to promote the creation of collections of cases, a tablet application was developed which makes use of electronic health records as material for Virtual Patient cases. Because electronic health records are abundantly available on hospital information systems, this results in much material for the basis of case creation. Results: An iPad-based Virtual Patient interactive software system was developed entitled Casebook. The application has been designed to read specially formatted patient cases that have been created using electronic health records, in the form of X-ray images, electrocardiograms, lab reports, and physician notes, and present these to the medical student. These health records are organised into a timeline, and the student navigates the case while answering questions regarding the patient along the way. Each health record can also be annotated with meta-information by the case designer, such as insight into the thought processes and the decision-making rationale of the physician who originally worked with the patient. Students learn decision-making skills by observing and interacting with real patient cases in this simulated environment. This paper discusses our approach in detail. Conclusions: Our group is of the opinion that Virtual Patient cases, targeted at undergraduate students, should concern patients who exhibit prototypical symptoms of the kind students may encounter when beginning their first medical jobs. Learning theory research has shown that students learn decision-making skills best when they have access to multitudes of patient cases and it is this plurality that allows students to develop their illness scripts effectively. Casebook emphasises the use of pre-existing electronic health record data as the basis for case creation, thus, it is hoped, making it easier to produce cases in larger numbers. By creating a Virtual Patient system where cases are built from abundantly available electronic health records, collections of cases can be accumulated by institutions."
Inside the Debriefing Room: Multidisciplinary Rapid Response Team Training Findings Revealed,CLINICAL SIMULATION IN NURSING,"Background: Research indicates that, despite the intent to save lives through rapid response teams (RRTs), mortality and morbidity outcome data are variable. A reason for that may be a lack of proficient and consistent training and education. Objectives: To determine whether high-fidelity simulation is an effective instructional method for interdisciplinary RRT training. Methods: Multidisciplinary health care team members participated in high-fidelity simulation scenarios, were evaluated by the instructors during the simulation, and then were given the opportunity to give informal and formal feedback. Results: The results of an anonymous survey sent to all participants showed that a majority who completed the online survey (91.4%) found this instructional method to be either very effective or somewhat effective for teaching in the hospital setting. The majority of participants (63.6%) indicated that high-fidelity simulation was their preferred method of learning when compared with case studies, online learning modules, or classroom/lecture. Major themes and opportunities identified for additional training were communication, assessment skills, teamwork, critical thinking, cardiopulmonary resuscitation skill retention, and timely initiation of RRT calls. Conclusions: This pilot study supports the current literature detailing the effectiveness of high-fidelity simulation and perceived learner outcomes. During crisis situations, there are significant communication barriers that can derail care providers from providing the most optimal care to the patient. As a result of debriefing, it was found that derogatory comments made by the RRT members during previous rapid response calls significantly impacted how early subsequent rapid responses were called by some participants.

Prioritization of SNPs in y+LAT-1 culpable of Lysinuric protein intolerance and their mutational impacts using protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies,JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY,"Lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI) is a rare, yet inimical, genetic disorder characterized by the paucity of essential dibasic amino acids in the cells. Amino acid transporter y+LAT-1 interacts with 4F2 cell-surface antigen heavy chain to transport the required dibasic amino acids. Mutation in y+LAT-1 is rumored to cause LPI. However, the underlying pathological mechanism is unknown, and, in this analysis, we investigate the impact of point mutation in y+LAT-1's interaction with 4F2 cell-surface antigen heavy chain in causing LPI. Using an efficient and extensive computational pipeline, we have isolated M50K and L334R single-nucleotide polymorphisms to be the most deleterious mutations in y+LAT-1s. Docking of mutant y+LAT-1 with 4F2 cell-surface antigen heavy chain showed decreased interaction compared with native y+LAT-1. Further, molecular dynamic simulation analysis reveals that the protein molecules increase in size, become more flexible, and alter their secondary structure upon mutation. We believe that these conformational changes because of mutation could be the reason for decreased interaction with 4F2 cell-surface antigen heavy chain causing LPI. Our analysis gives pathological insights about LPI and helps researchers to better understand the disease mechanism and develop an effective treatment strategy."
Tools for structured team communication in pre-registration health professions education: a Best Evidence Medical Education (BEME) review: BEME Guide No. 41,MEDICAL TEACHER,"Introduction: Calls for the inclusion of standardized protocols for information exchange into pre-registration health professions curricula have accompanied their introduction into clinical practice. In order to help clinical educators respond to these calls, we have reviewed educational interventions for pre-registration students that incorporate one or more of these 'tools for structured communication'. Methods: Searches of 10 databases (1990-2014) were supplemented by hand searches and by citation searches (to January 2015). Studies evaluating an intervention for pre-registration students of any clinical profession and incorporating at least one tool were included. Quality of included studies was assessed using a checklist of 11 indicators and a narrative synthesis of findings undertaken. Results: Fifty studies met our inclusion criteria. Of these, 21 evaluated the specific effect of a tool on educational outcomes, and 27 met seven or more quality indicators. Conclusions: Pre-registration students, particularly those in the US, are learning to use tools for structured communication either in specific sessions or integrated into more extensive courses or programmes; mostly 'Situation Background Assessment Recommendation' and its variants. There is some evidence that learning to use a tool can improve the clarity and comprehensiveness of student communication, their perceived self-confidence and their sense of preparedness for clinical practice. There is, as yet, little evidence for the transfer of these skills to the clinical setting or for any influence of teaching approach on learning outcomes. Educators will need to consider the positioning of such learning with other skills such as clinical reasoning and decision-making."
Correlation between students' and trainers' evaluations while learning delegated surgical procedures: A prospective cohort study,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY,"Background: The delegation of procedures within the medical competence to the nurses can increase the effectiveness of the healthcare provided. The objectives of the study are (1) to assess the quality of training courses for delegated surgical procedures through implementation for graduate scrub nursing (students) (2) and to evaluate the correlation between the evaluation of this training carried out by students and the self-assessment conducted by the faculty (trainers). Materials and methods: We set up a 49-h training for five groups of 10 students from July 2016 to July 2017 in our tertiary academic hospital. The course consisted mostly in simulations based on the Zwisch model and focused on acquiring the control of the gesture as well as on the development of critical reasoning. An evaluation of the training by the students but also a self-assessment of trainers were prospectively collected using the SFDP26 questionnaire. Results: 52 active scrub nursing students and 21 trainers were included. 96% of students and 86% of trainers evaluated the training from good to very good. Progress was observed for 41 (79%) of the students and 18 (86%) of the trainers, and 98% of students felt able to put their new skills into clinical practice after training. There was no difference between the total scores of students and teachers (p = 0.153). A statistically significant difference between the evaluations produced by the students and the self-evaluations produced by the trainers was observed for 8 of the 26 items of assessment. In case of inadequacy, the trainers' scores were always lower than those of the students. Conclusions: Training in performing delegated surgical procedures by mixed cognitive and motor gestures learning, based on the development of critical thinking and simulations seems to be effective, with a significant improvement in students' knowledge and skills. Expectations of students and trainers are well correlated."
A review of disease progression models of Parkinson's disease and applications in clinical trials,MOVEMENT DISORDERS,"Quantitative disease progression models for neurodegenerative disorders are gaining recognition as important tools for drug development and evaluation. In Parkinson's disease (PD), several models have described longitudinal changes in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), one of the most utilized outcome measures for PD trials assessing disease progression. We conducted a literature review to examine the methods and applications of quantitative disease progression modeling for PD using a combination of key words including Parkinson disease, progression, and model. For this review, we focused on models of PD progression quantifying changes in the total UPDRS scores against time. Four different models reporting equations and parameters have been published using linear and nonlinear functions. The reasons for constructing disease progression models of PD thus far have been to quantify disease trajectories of PD patients in active and inactive treatment arms of clinical trials, to quantify and discern symptomatic and disease-modifying treatment effects, and to demonstrate how model-based methods may be used to design clinical trials. The historical lack of efficiency of PD clinical trials begs for model-based simulations in planning for studies that result in more informative conclusions, particularly around disease modification.

Do pharmacokinetic polymorphisms explain treatment failure in high-risk patients with neuroblastoma?,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,"Purpose Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumour in childhood. It accounts for 15% of all paediatric oncology deaths. In the last few decades, improvement in treatment outcome for high-risk patients has not occurred, with an overall survival rate <30-40%. Many reasons may account for such a low survival rate. The aim of this review is to evaluate whether pharmacogenetic factors can explain treatment failure in neuroblastoma. Methods A literature search based on PubMed's database Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) was performed to retrieve all pertinent publications on current treatment options and new classes of drugs under investigation. One hundred and fifty-eight articles wer reviewed, and relevant data were extracted and summarised. Results and conclusions Few of the large number of polymorphisms identified thus far showed an effect on pharmacokinetics that could be considered clinically relevant. Despite their clinical relevance, none of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) investigated can explain treatment failure. These findings seem to reflect the clinical context in which anti-tumour drugs are used, i.e. in combination with multi-modal therapy. In addition, many pharmacogenetic studies did not assess (differences in) drug exposure, which could contribute to explaining pharmacogenctic associations. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether the significant activity of new drugs on different neuroblastoma cell lines translates into clinical efficacy, irrespective of resistance or myelocytomatosis viral related oncogene, neuroblastoma derived (MYCN) amplification. Elucidation of the clinical role of pharmacogenetic factors in the treatment of neuroblastoma demands an integrated pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic approach to the analysis of treatment response data."
Real-time Modeling of Abnormal Physiological Signals in a Phantom for Bioengineering Education,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2020 IEEE GLOBAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION CONFERENCE (EDUCON 2020),"In clinical practice and in particular in the diagnostic process, the assessment of cardiac and respiratory functions is supported by electrocardiogram and auscultation. These exams are non-invasive, quick and inexpensive to perform and easy to interpret. For these reasons, this type of assessment is a constant in the daily life of a clinician and the information obtained is central to the decision making process. Therefore, it is essential that during their training, students of health-related subjects acquire skills in the acquisition and evaluation of the referred physiological signals. Simulation, considering the technological possibilities of today, is an excellent preparation tool since it exposes trainees to near real contexts but without the associated risks. Hence, the simulation of physiological signals plays an important role in the education of healthcare professionals, bioengineering professionals and also in the development and calibration of medical devices. This paper describes a project to develop synchronized electrocardiogram (ECG), phonocardiogram (PCG) and breathing sounds simulators that aims to improve an existing phantom simulator. The developed system allows, in an integrated way, to generate normal and pathological signals, being contemplated several distinct pathologies. For engineering education, it is also possible to simulate the introduction of signal disturbances or hardware malfunctions. A graphical interface allows changing operating parameters in real time."
An investigation into the use of MMCTP to tune accelerator source parameters and testing its clinical application,JOURNAL OF APPLIED CLINICAL MEDICAL PHYSICS,"This paper presents an alternative method to tune Monte Carlo electron beam parameters to match measured data using a minimal set of variables in order to reduce the model setup time prior to clinical implementation of the model. Monte Carlo calculations provide the possibility of a powerful treatment planning verification technique. The nonstandardized and nonautomated process of tuning the required accelerator model is one of the reasons for delays in the clinical implementation of Monte Carlo techniques. This work aims to establish and verify an alternative tuning method that can be carried out in a minimal amount of time, allowing it to be easily implemented in a clinical setting by personnel with minimal experience with Monte Carlo methods. This tuned model can then be incorporated into the MMCTP system to allow the system to be used as a second dose calculation check for IMRT plans. The technique proposed was used to establish the primary electron beam parameters for accelerator models for the Varian Clinac 2100 6 MV photon beam using the BEAMnrc Monte Carlo system. The method is intended to provide a clear, direct, and efficient process for tuning an accelerator model using readily available clinical quality assurance data. The tuning provides a refined model, which agrees with measured dose profile curves within 1.5% outside the penumbra or 3 mm in the penumbra, for square fields with sides of 3 cm up to 30 cm. These models can then be employed as the basis for Monte Carlo recalculations of dose distributions, using the MMCTP system, for clinical treatment plans, providing an invaluable assessment tool. This was tested on six IMRT plans and compared to the measurements performed for the pretreatment QA process. These Monte Carlo values for the average dose to the chamber volume agreed with measurements to within 0.6%."
Online Magnetic Resonance Image Guided Adaptive Radiation Therapy: First Clinical Applications,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS,"Purpose: To demonstrate the feasibility of online adaptive magnetic resonance (MR) image guided radiation therapy (MR-IGRT) through reporting of our initial clinical experience and workflow considerations. Methods and Materials: The first clinically deployed online adaptive MR-IGRT system consisted of a split 0.35T MR scanner straddling a ring gantry with 3 multileaf collimator-equipped Co-60 heads. The unit is supported by a Monte Carlo-based treatment planning system that allows real-time adaptive planning with the patient on the table. All patients undergo computed tomography and MR imaging (MRI) simulation for initial treatment planning. A volumetric MRI scan is acquired for each patient at the daily treatment setup. Deformable registration is performed using the planning computed tomography data set, which allows for the transfer of the initial contours and the electron density map to the daily MRI scan. The deformed electron density map is then used to recalculate the original plan on the daily MRI scan for physician evaluation. Recontouring and plan reoptimization are performed when required, and patient-specific quality assurance (QA) is performed using an independent in-house software system. Results: The first online adaptive MR-IGRT treatments consisted of 5 patients with abdominopelvic malignancies. The clinical setting included neoadjuvant colorectal (n=3), unresectable gastric (n=1), and unresectable pheochromocytoma (n=1). Recontouring and reoptimization were deemed necessary for 3 of 5 patients, and the initial plan was deemed sufficient for 2 of the 5 patients. The reasons for plan adaptation included tumor progression or regression and a change in small bowel anatomy. In a subsequently expanded cohort of 170 fractions (20 patients), 52 fractions (30.6%) were reoptimized online, and 92 fractions (54.1%) were treated with an online-adapted or previously adapted plan. The median time for recontouring, reoptimization, and QA was 26 minutes. Conclusion: Online adaptive MR-IGRT has been successfully implemented with planning and QA workflow suitable for routine clinical application. Clinical trials are in development to formally evaluate adaptive treatments for a variety of disease sites. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Towards the virtual human patient. Quantitative Systems Pharmacology in Alzheimer's disease,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY,"Development of successful therapeutic interventions in Central Nervous Systems (CNS) disorders is a daunting challenge with a low success rate. Probable reasons include the lack of translation from preclinical animal models, the individual variability of many pathological processes converging upon the same clinical phenotype, the pharmacodynamical interaction of various comedications and last but not least the complexity of the human brain. This paper argues for a re-engineering of the pharmaceutical CNS Research & Development strategy using ideas focused on advanced computer modeling and simulation from adjacent engineering-based industries. We provide examples that such a Quantitative Systems Pharmacology approach based on computer simulation of biological processes and that combines the best of preclinical research with actual clinical outcomes can enhance translation to the clinical situation. We will expand upon (1) the need to go from Big Data to Smart Data and develop predictive and quantitative algorithms that are actionable for the pharma industry, (2) using this platform as a knowledge machine that captures community-wide expertise in an active hypothesis-testing approach, (3) learning from failed clinical trials and (4) the need to go beyond simple linear hypotheses and embrace complex non-linear hypotheses. We will propose a strategy for applying these concepts to the substantial individual variability of AD patient subgroups and the treatment of neuropsychiatric problems in AD. Quantitative Systems Pharmacology is a new 'humanized' tool for supporting drug discovery and development in general and CNS disorders in particular."
A novel estimand to adjust for rescue treatment in randomized clinical trials,STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,"The interpretation of randomized clinical trial results is often complicated by intercurrent events. For instance, rescue medication is sometimes given to patients in response to worsening of their disease, either in addition to the randomized treatment or in its place. The use of such medication complicates the interpretation of the intention-to-treat analysis. In view of this, we propose a novel estimand defined as the intention-to-treat effect that would have been observed, had patients on the active arm been switched to rescue medication if and only if they would have been switched when randomized to control. This enables us to disentangle the treatment effect from the effect of rescue medication on a patient's outcome, while tempering the strong extrapolations that are typically needed when inferring what the intention-to-treat effect would have been in the absence of rescue medication. We propose a novel inverse probability weighting method for estimating this effect in settings where the decision to initiate rescue medication is made at one prespecified time point. This estimator relies on specific untestable assumptions, in view of which we propose a sensitivity analysis. We use the method for the analysis of a clinical trial conducted by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, in which patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus can switch to rescue medication for ethical reasons. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the proposed estimator is unbiased in moderate sample sizes."
Enhancing the Informed Consent Process Using Shared Decision Making and Consent Refusal Data from the CLEAR III Trial,NEUROCRITICAL CARE,"Background: The process of informed consent in National Institutes of Health randomized, placebo-controlled trials is poorly studied. There are several issues regarding informed consent in emergency neurologic trials, including a shared decision-making process with the patient or a legally authorized representative about overall risks, benefits, and alternative treatments. Methods: To evaluate the informed consent process, we collected best and worst informed consent practice information from a National Institutes of Health trial and used this in medical simulation videos to educate investigators at multiple sites to improve the consent process. Clot Lysis: Evaluating Accelerated Resolution of Intraventricular Hemorrhage Phase III (CLEAR III) (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00784134) studied the effect of intraventricular alteplase (n = 251) versus saline (placebo) injections (n = 249) for intraventricular hemorrhage reduction. Reasons for ineligibility (including refusing to consent) for all screen failures were analyzed. The broadcasted presentation outlined best practices for doctor-patient interactions during the consenting process, as well as anecdotal, study-specific reasons for consent refusal. Best and worst consent elements were then incorporated into a simulation video to enhance the informed consent process. This video was disseminated to trial sites as a webinar around the midpoint of the trial to improve the consent process. Pre- and post-intervention consent refusals were compared. Results: During the trial, 10,538 patients were screened for eligibility, of which only three were excluded due to trial timing. Pre-intervention, 77 of 5686 (1.40%) screen eligible patients or their proxies refused consent. Post-intervention, 55 of 4849 (1.10%) refused consent, which was not significantly different from pre-intervention (P = 0.312). The incidence of screen failures was significantly lower post-intervention (P = 0.006), possibly due to several factors for patient exclusion. Conclusion: The informed consent process for prospective randomized trials may be enhanced by studying and refining best practices based on trial-specific plans and patient concerns particular to a study."
Cognitive interventions to reduce diagnostic error: a narrative review,BMJ QUALITY & SAFETY,"Background: Errors in clinical reasoning occur in most cases in which the diagnosis is missed, delayed or wrong. The goal of this review was to identify interventions that might reduce the likelihood of these cognitive errors. Design: We searched PubMed and other medical and non-medical databases and identified additional literature through references from the initial data set and suggestions from subject matter experts. Articles were included if they either suggested a possible intervention or formally evaluated an intervention and excluded if they focused solely on improving diagnostic tests or provider satisfaction. Results: We identified 141 articles for full review, 42 reporting tested interventions to reduce the likelihood of cognitive errors, 100 containing suggestions, and one article with both suggested and tested interventions. Articles were classified into three categories: (1) Interventions to improve knowledge and experience, such as simulation-based training, improved feedback and education focused on a single disease; (2) Interventions to improve clinical reasoning and decision-making skills, such as reflective practice and active metacognitive review; and (3) Interventions that provide cognitive 'help' that included use of electronic records and integrated decision support, informaticians and facilitating access to information, second opinions and specialists. Conclusions: We identified a wide range of possible approaches to reduce cognitive errors in diagnosis. Not all the suggestions have been tested, and of those that have, the evaluations typically involved trainees in artificial settings, making it difficult to extrapolate the results to actual practice. Future progress in this area will require methodological refinements in outcome evaluation and rigorously evaluating interventions already suggested, many of which are well conceptualised and widely endorsed."
Virtual patients: a critical literature review and proposed next steps,MEDICAL EDUCATION,"The opposing forces of increased training expectations and reduced training resources have greatly impacted health professions education. Virtual patients (VPs), which take the form of interactive computer-based clinical scenarios, may help to reconcile this paradox. We summarise research on VPs, highlight the spectrum of potential variation and identify an agenda for future research. We also critically consider the role of VPs in the educational armamentarium. We propose that VPs' most unique and cost-effective function is to facilitate and assess the development of clinical reasoning. Clinical reasoning in experts involves a non-analytical process that matures through deliberate practice with multiple and varied clinical cases. Virtual patients are ideally suited to this task. Virtual patients can also be used in learner assessment, but scoring rubrics should emphasise non-analytical clinical reasoning rather than completeness of information or algorithmic approaches. Potential variations in VP design are practically limitless, yet few studies have rigorously explored design issues. More research is needed to inform instructional design and curricular integration. Virtual patients should be designed and used to promote clinical reasoning skills. More research is needed to inform how to effectively use VPs."
The laparoscopic inguinal and diaphragmatic defect (LIDD) model: a validation study of a novel box trainer model,SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES,"BackgroundPaediatric laparoscopic procedures are now becoming routine practice. Therefore, there is a need for simulated laparoscopic models to acquire part-procedural competency prior to direct patient contact in a safe learning environment. For this reason, we chose two paediatric conditions; inguinal hernia (IH) and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), which were combined to create the laparoscopic inguinal and diaphragmatic defect (LIDD) model. Our aim was to assess this novel surgical simulation model by determining its construct and content validity.MethodsA total of 107 participants completed the validation study: volunteer medical students (novices), surgical trainees (intermediate) and consultant surgeons (experts). Basic demographic data were collected. Subjects were shown a pre-recorded video of both exercises. The assessment exercise involved closing both the simulated inguinal or diaphragmatic hernial orifice. The task was assessed using a novel scoring system with a maximum score of 21 for IH model and 15 for the CDH. The content validity was assessed by a 6-point Likert scale of the expert group.Results105/107 participants successfully completed the two exercises. Both aspects of the LIDD model revealed a statistical significance between the scores obtained by the three groups of subjects. Experts scored 20.3/21 for the IH and 14.8/15 for the CDH models which significantly higher than medical students (6.3/21 and 5.3/15; p<0.05 for both) and trainees (11.2/21 and 9.3/15; p<0.05 for both). Similarly, trainees performed significantly better than medical students in both models (p<0.05). Therefore, the LIDD model was found to have a good construct validity. It was, however, unable to differentiate between the various levels of trainees in the intermediate group. Content validity from the experts revealed that there was a high score for the potential of both aspects of LIDD (4.8 and 4.8). There was also a high level of functional fidelity for task completion (4.0 and 4.0).ConclusionsWe have demonstrated both the construct and content validity of the LIDD model for both laparoscopic IH and CDH repair. It was able to successfully differentiate between the expert, trainees and inexperienced laparoscopic surgeons."
Emergencies in Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Bootcamp: A Novel Canadian Experience,LARYNGOSCOPE,"Objectives/HypothesisA 1-day intensive course (bootcamp) was developed, to teach junior otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (OTO-HNS) residents emergency procedural skills, clinical reasoning, and communication skills. This learning paradigm utilized a number of novel task trainers, panel discussions, and emergency simulations. The study objective was to assess the educational value of this bootcamp. Study DesignProspective cohort survey. MethodsResidents were recruited from regional teaching centers within a 2000-km radius of the simulation center. Preceptors fluent in English and in French were in attendance. Pre-bootcamp outcome measures included the Kolb Learning Style Inventory and a self-administered survey measuring confidence levels in performing specific OTO-HNS tasks. Post-bootcamp outcome measures included a survey evaluating the bootcamp experience and a structured follow-up telephone interview. ResultsTwenty-eight residents participated in the bootcamp from across the United States and Canada. When asked if they felt that overall, the educational day was an effective learning process, the average score was 4.75/5.0. The vast majority of participants (92.9%) felt they would recommend the bootcamp to a future junior resident. Kolb learning styles that prefer active experimentation (acting, initiating, and deciding) were more common than those that utilize reflective observation (imagining, analyzing, reflecting), which favors a hands-on model of learning. ConclusionThis first Canadian OTO-HNS bootcamp demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of conducting a centralized bootcamp for regional training centers spanning multiple states/provinces and languages. Future bootcamps will be held annually and will ideally continue the natural evolution of surgical, hands-on training."
Learning Conversations: An Analysis of the Theoretical Roots and Their Manifestations of Feedback and Debriefing in Medical Education,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,"Feedback and debriefing are experience-informed dialogues upon which experiential models of learning often depend. Efforts to understand each have largely been independent of each other, thus splitting them into potentially problematic and less productive factions. Given their shared purpose of improving future performance, the authors asked whether efforts to understand these dialogues are, for theoretical and pragmatic reasons, best advanced by keeping these concepts unique or whether some unifying conceptual framework could better support educational contributions and advancements in medical education. The authors identified seminal works and foundational concepts to formulate a purposeful review and analysis exploring these dialogues' theoretical roots and their manifestations. They considered conceptual and theoretical details within and across feedback and debriefing literatures and traced developmental paths to discover underlying and foundational conceptual approaches and theoretical similarities and differences. Findings suggest that each of these strategies was derived from distinct theoretical roots, leading to variations in how they have been studied, advanced, and enacted; both now draw on multiple (often similar) educational theories, also positioning themselves as ways of operationalizing similar educational frameworks. Considerable commonality now exists; those studying and advancing feedback and debriefing are leveraging similar cognitive and social theories to refine and structure their approaches. As such, there may be room to merge these educational strategies as learning conversations because of their conceptual and theoretical consistency. Future scholarly work should further delineate the theoretical, educational, and practical relevance of integrating feedback and debriefing."
Temporal Trends and Clinical Consequences of Wait Times for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Population-Based Study,CIRCULATION,"Background: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) represents a paradigm shift in the therapeutic options for patients with severe aortic stenosis. However, rapid and exponential growth in TAVR demand may overwhelm capacity, translating to inadequate access and prolonged wait times. Our objective was to evaluate temporal trends in TAVR wait times and the associated clinical consequences. Methods: In this population-based study in Ontario, Canada, we identified all TAVR referrals from April 1, 2010, to March 31, 2016. The primary outcome was the median total wait time from referral to procedure. Piecewise regression analyses were performed to assess temporal trends in TAVR wait times, before and after provincial reimbursement in September 2012. Clinical outcomes included all-cause death and heart failure hospitalizations while on the wait list. Results: The study cohort included 4461 referrals, of which 50% led to a TAVR, 39% were off-listed for other reasons, and 11% remained on the wait list at the conclusion of the study. For patients who underwent a TAVR, the estimated median wait time in the postreimbursement period stabilized at 80 days and has remained unchanged. The cumulative probability of wait-list mortality and heart failure hospitalization at 80 days was approximate to 2% and 12%, respectively, with a relatively constant increase in events with increased wait times. Conclusions: Postreimbursement wait time has remained unchanged for patients undergoing a TAVR procedure, suggesting the increase in capacity has kept pace with the increase in demand. The current wait time of almost 3 months is associated with important morbidity and mortality, suggesting a need for greater capacity and access."

Insights into resistance mechanism of hepatitis C virus nonstructural 3/4A protease mutant to boceprevir using umbrella sampling simulation study,JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS,"Hepatitis C virus can cause inflammation in human liver cells, leading to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. Based on the World Health Organization reports, about 228 million people in the world have hepatitis C. To date, some inhibitory medicines against the hepatitis C virus nonstructural 3/4A protease, such as boceprevir, have entered clinical trial phases. However, several hepatitis C virus nonstructural 3/4A protease mutations have been recognized to decrease susceptibility of boceprevir to hepatitis C virus. The molecular details behind inhibitor resistance of these single-point mutations are not still understood. Thus, in this research, computational strategies were applied to clarify the inhibitor resistance mechanism. From umbrella sampling simulation and energy profiles, the polar interactions are the main driving force for boceprevir binding. Based on the analyzed R155T mutant, the main reason for the occurrence of boceprevir resistance is the conformation alterations of S4 and extended S2 binding pockets. These changes, lead to decreased binding ability of the key residues to P2 and P4 moieties of boceprevir. Moreover, structural results show that the disappearance of important salt bridges can bring about the great conformation changes of the binding pockets in R155T. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma"
Development and questionnaire-based evaluation of virtual dental clinic: a serious game for training dental students,MEDICAL EDUCATION ONLINE,"Background The volume of literature about serious gaming in dental education has increased, however, none of the previous studies have developed a serious game for closing the gap between preclinical and clinical training. Objective Virtual Dental Clinic (VDC) is a serious game that was created to help develop clinical reasoning skills in dental students. This study aimed to evaluate VDC as an educational tool and its effectiveness on clinical skill and knowledge gain among clerkship dental students. Methods The following three stages of VDC design and testing were addressed from 2016 to 2020: development, validation, and application. The VDC was developed using Unity game engine. In the validation stage, the content validity was reviewed by five visiting staff; construct validity and face validity were examined by 9 postgraduate-year dentists and 14 clerkship dental students. Concurrent validity and predictive validity were examined by 34 fifth-year dental students during their clerkship from September, 2018 to May, 2019, the associations between VDC experiences, clerkship performance, and the score on a national qualification test were explored. In the application stage, the VDC was set up as a self-learning tool in the Family Dentistry Department from August, 2019, quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted using the 92 clerkship students' feedback. Results The VDC showed good validity and a high potential for education in practice. Students who have used VDC received significantly higher scores on qualification test (p = 0.029); the VDC experiences significantly predicted higher performance score on periodontics (p = 0.037) and endodontics (p = 0.040). After the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, significantly higher proportion of students confirmed the value of VDC as an assistant tool for learning clinical reasoning (p = 0.019). Conclusions The VDC as an educational tool, and the effectiveness on clinical reasoning skills and knowledge gain among clerkship dental students has been validated and confirmed in this study."
"A group sequential, response-adaptive design for randomized clinical trials",CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS,"There has been considerable methodological research on response-adaptive designs for clinical trials but they have seldom been used in practice. The many reasons for this are summarized in an article by Rosenberger and Lachin, but the two main reasons generally cited are logistical difficulties and the potential for bias due to selection effects, drift in patient characteristics or risk factors over time, and other sources. Jennison and Turnbull consider a group sequential, response-adaptive design for continuous outcome variables that partially addresses these concerns while at the same time allowing for early stopping. The key advantage of a group sequential approach in which randomization probabilities are kept constant within sequential groups is that a stratified analysis will eliminate bias due to drift. In this article we consider binary outcomes and an algorithm for altering the allocation ratio that depends on the strength of the accumulated evidence. Specifically, patients are enrolled in groups of size n(Ak), n(Bk), k = 1, 2, ... K, where n(Ak), n(Bk) are the sample sizes in treatment arms A and B in sequential group k. Patients are initially allocated in a 1: 1 ratio. After the kth interim analysis, if the z-value comparing outcomes in the two treatment groups is less than 1.0 in absolute value, the ratio remains 1:1; if the z-value exceeds 1.0, the next sequential group is allocated in the ratio R, favoring the currently better-performing treatment; if the z-statistic exceeds 1.5, the allocation ratio is R-2, and if the z-value exceeds 2.0, the allocation ratio is R-3. If the O'Brien-Fleming monitoring boundary is exceeded the trial is terminated. Group sample-sizes are adjusted upward to maintain equal increments of information when allocation ratios exceed one. The z-statistic is derived from a weighted log-odds ratio stratified by sequential group. Simulation studies and theoretical calculations were performed under a variety of scenarios and allocation rules. Results indicate that the method maintains the nominal type I error rate even when there is substantial drift in the patient population. When a true treatment difference exists, a modest reduction in the number of patients assigned to the inferior treatment arm can be achieved at the expense of smaller increases in the total sample size relative to a nonadaptive design. Limitations, such as the impact of delays in observing outcomes, are discussed, as well as areas for further research. We conclude that responsive adaptive designs may be useful for some purposes, particularly in the presence of large treatment effects, although allowing early stopping minimizes the benefits. If such a design is undertaken, the randomization and analysis should be stratified in order to avoid bias due to time trends. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"The development of medicines for children Part of a series on Pediatric Pharmacology, guest edited by Gianvincenzo Zuccotti, Emilio Clementi, and Massimo Molteni",PHARMACOLOGICAL RESEARCH,"The lack of availability of appropriate medicines for children is an extensive and well known problem. As a consequence off label or unlicensed administration of medicinal products in every day paediatric practice is frequent. A variety of obstacles hinder the development of paediatric indications for drugs primarily intended for the adult market. The barriers to proper research on children's drug development include several complex factors, such as the limited commercial interest, lack of suitable infrastructure and competence for conducting paediatric clinical trials, difficulties in trial design, ethical worries and many others. Medicinal products used to treat children should be subjected to ethical research of high quality and be explicitly authorised for use in children as it happens in adults. Conducting adequate clinical trials in children is challenging and demanding. Identification of paediatric medical needs, extrapolation from adult data, modelling and simulation, specific clinical trial methodology are important features in the development of drugs intended for children. Market forces alone have proven insufficient to stimulate adequate research aimed at specific authorisation of medicinal products for the paediatric population, and for that reason, following the US experience, the European Paediatric Regulation has been amended in January 2007 by the European Commission. The objective of the Paediatric Regulation is to improve the development of high quality and ethically researched medicines for children aged 0 to 17 years, to facilitate the availability of information on the use of medicines for children, without subjecting children to unnecessary trials, or delaying the authorisation of medicines for use in adults. The impact of the Paediatric Regulation reflects in an increase in the number of paediatric studies to be performed, even if a significant number of these studies have not started yet. The objective of this review is to describe the main regulatory and scientific features which play a role in the complex issue of paediatric drug development. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Tigecycline,CLINICAL PHARMACOKINETICS,"Rapid emergence of resistance against antibacterials emphasizes the need for the development of novel and/or more potent antibacterials. Tigecycline is the first representative of a new drug class, the glycylcyclines, and was approved in 2005 by the US FDA for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections, as well as complicated intra-abdominal infections. Tigecycline distributes extensively into the intracellular space of tissue and accumulates in cells, which may qualify it for the treatment of intracellular infections. The pharmacokinetics of tigecycline are complex with both linear and non-linear characteristics. The reason for this complexity is still not fully understood. Non-linearity can be found in the volume of distribution possibly due to extensive and variable tissue and/or plasma protein binding. In contrast, clearance and area under the plasma concentration-time curve are dose-independent. Tigecycline has a high incidence of mild adverse effects, mainly nausea and vomiting, but is otherwise well tolerated."
Survey of non-tunneled temporary hemodialysis catheter clinical practice and training,JOURNAL OF VASCULAR ACCESS,"Background: Nephrologists are placing fewer non-tunneled temporary hemodialysis catheters. Requiring competence for nephrology fellow graduation is controversial. Methods: Anonymous, online survey of all graduates from a single, military nephrology training program (n = 81; 1985-2017) and all US Nephrology program directors (n = 150). Results: Graduate response and completion rates were 59% and 100%, respectively; 93% agreed they had been adequately trained; 58% (26/45) place non-tunneled temporary hemodialysis catheters, independent of academic practice or time in practice, but 12/26 did <= 5/year and 23/26 referred some or all. The most common reason for continuing non-tunneled temporary hemodialysis catheter placement was that it is an essential emergency procedure (92%). The single most significant barrier was time to do the procedure (49%). Program director response and completion rates were 50% and 79%, respectively. The single most important barrier to fellow competence was busyness of the service (36%), followed by disinterest (21%); 55% believed that non-tunneled temporary hemodialysis catheter insertion competence should be required, with 81% indicating it was an essential emergency procedure. The majority of graduates and program directors agreed that simulation training was valuable; 76% of programs employ simulation. Graduates who had simulation training and program directors with <= 20 years of practice were significantly more likely to agree that simulation training was necessary. Conclusion: Of the graduate respondents from a single training program, 58% continue to place non-tunneled temporary hemodialysis catheters; 55% of program directors believe non-tunneled temporary hemodialysis catheter procedural competence should be required. Graduates who had non-tunneled temporary hemodialysis catheter simulation training and younger program directors consider simulation training necessary. These findings should be considered in the discussion of non-tunneled temporary hemodialysis catheter curriculum requirements."
Improved contrast-to-noise ratio of photon counting clinical X-ray CT images using a model-selection based approach,2010 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD (NSS/MIC),"Energy sensitive photon counting x-ray detectors (PCXD) [1] have many advantages over energy-integrating x-ray detectors (EIXD) in x-ray computed tomography (CT), such as the ability to measure the spectrum of x-ray beams. When such PCXDs are operated under a high count rate in clinical scanners, coincident photons would distort the recorded energy spectrum due to the limited speed of the detector. To compensate for the spectrum distortions, we have developed analytical models for them [3] and integrated one such model into an image reconstruction process using a sinogram restoration framework [6]. In this method, the attenuation of the object was modeled as a sum of line integrals of N basis functions, where N was fixed at 3 for the entire sinogram when a contrast agent is involved. The method allowed us to reconstruct accurate images, compensating for the effect of spectrum distortion of PCXD; however, the contrast-to-noise (CNR) of the images were only comparable to that obtained by EIXDs. We believe the main reason is an increased statistical uncertainty in the estimated line integrals introduced by the 3rd basis function. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the CNR by employing the fewest number of basis functions N-m (<= N) as necessary for an individual sinogram ray. Our simulation studies indicate that the CNR achieved for a Gd-based contrast agent by PCXDs could be 12% better than the conventional method of [6], and 28% better than EIXDs for scans with similar number of x-ray photons, which points to a dose reduction of 20% and 39% respectively."
Monte Carlo study of the depth-dependent fluence perturbation in parallel-plate ionization chambers in electron beams,MEDICAL PHYSICS,"Purpose: The electron fluence inside a parallel-plate ionization chamber positioned in a water phantom and exposed to a clinical electron beam deviates from the unperturbed fluence in water in absence of the chamber. One reason for the fluence perturbation is the well-known inscattering effect, whose physical cause is the lack of electron scattering in the gas-filled cavity. Correction factors determined to correct for this effect have long been recommended. However, more recent Monte Carlo calculations have led to some doubt about the range of validity of these corrections. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to reanalyze the development of the fluence perturbation with depth and to review the function of the guard rings. Methods: Spatially resolved Monte Carlo simulations of the dose profiles within gas-filled cavities with various radii in clinical electron beams have been performed in order to determine the radial variation of the fluence perturbation in a coin-shaped cavity, to study the influences of the radius of the collecting electrode and of the width of the guard ring upon the indicated value of the ionization chamber formed by the cavity, and to investigate the development of the perturbation as a function of the depth in an electron-irradiated phantom. The simulations were performed for a primary electron energy of 6 MeV. Results: The Monte Carlo simulations clearly demonstrated a surprisingly large in-and outward electron transport across the lateral cavity boundary. This results in a strong influence of the depth-dependent development of the electron field in the surrounding medium upon the chamber reading. In the buildup region of the depth-dose curve, the in-out balance of the electron fluence is positive and shows the well-known dose oscillation near the cavity/water boundary. At the depth of the dose maximum the in-out balance is equilibrated, and in the falling part of the depth-dose curve it is negative, as shown here the first time. The influences of both the collecting electrode radius and the width of the guard ring are reflecting the deep radial penetration of the electron transport processes into the gas-filled cavities and the need for appropriate corrections of the chamber reading. New values for these corrections have been established in two forms, one converting the indicated value into the absorbed dose to water in the front plane of the chamber, the other converting it into the absorbed dose to water at the depth of the effective point of measurement of the chamber. In the Appendix, the in-out imbalance of electron transport across the lateral cavity boundary is demonstrated in the approximation of classical small-angle multiple scattering theory. Conclusions: The in-out electron transport imbalance at the lateral boundaries of parallel-plate chambers in electron beams has been studied with Monte Carlo simulation over a range of depth in water, and new correction factors, covering all depths and implementing the effective point of measurement concept, have been developed.

Initial findings and potential applicability of computational simulation of the aorta in acute type B dissection,JOURNAL OF VASCULAR SURGERY,"Objective: Type B aortic dissection can be acutely complicated by rapid expansion, rupture, and malperfusion syndromes. Short-term adverse outcomes are associated with failure of the false lumen to thrombose. The reasons behind false lumen patency are poorly understood, and the objective of this pilot study was to use computational fluid dynamics reconstructions of aortic dissection cases to analyze the effect of aortic and primary tear morphology on flow characteristics and clinical outcomes in patients with acute type B dissections. Methods: Three-dimensional patient-specific aortic dissection geometry was reconstructed from computed tomography scans of four patients presenting with acute type B aortic dissection and a further patient with sequential follow-up scans. The cases were selected based on their clinical presentation. Two were complicated by acute malperfusion that required emergency intervention. Three patients were uncomplicated and were managed conservatively. The patient-specific aortic models were used in computational simulations to assess the effect of aortic tear morphology on various parameters including flow, velocity, shear stress, and turbulence. Results: Pulsatile flow simulation results showed that flow rate into the false lumen was dependent on both the size and position of the primary tear. Linear regression analysis demonstrated a significant relationship between percentage flow entering the false lumen and the size of the primary entry tear and an inverse relationship between false lumen flow and the site of the entry tear. Subjects complicated by malperfusion had larger-dimension entry tears than the uncomplicated cases (93% and 82% compared with 32% and 55%, respectively). Blood flow, wall shear stress, and turbulence levels varied significantly between subjects depending on aortic geometry. Highest wall shear stress (>7 Pa) was located at the tear edge, and progression of false lumen thrombosis was associated with prolonged particle residence times. Conclusions: Results obtained from this preliminary work suggest that aortic morphology and primary entry tear size and position exert significant effects on flow and other hemodynamic parameters in the dissected aorta in this preliminary work. Blood flow into the false lumen increases with increasing tear size and proximal location. Morphologic analysis coupled with computational fluid dynamic modeling may be useful in predicting acute type B dissection behavior allowing for selection of proper treatment modalities, and further confirmatory studies are warranted.

Role of pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation in precision dosing of anticancer drugs,TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH,"The prospect of precision dosing in oncology is attractive for several reasons. Many anticancer drugs display narrow therapeutic indices, where suboptimal therapy may lead to severe patient outcomes. Clinical study participant recruitment is seldom extended beyond the intended patient population, leading to difficulties in patient recruitment in dedicated clinical trials. The high rate of non-responders and high cost of cancer therapy warrant novel solutions to increase clinical effectiveness and cost-benefit, pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling and model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) can help to maximize these. PK modeling provides a quantitative framework to account for inter-individual variability in drug exposure, the influence of covariates and extrapolation to special populations or drug-drug interactions, using physiologically-based PK (PBPK) modeling. Here we present the current state of PK modeling in precision dosing of anticancer drugs and illustrate its utility, based on an extensive literature review and numerous case examples from both pharmaceutical industry and healthcare focused research. While some great progress has been made in implementing model-informed dosage guidance in the drug label and much research has been carried out to address clinically relevant dosing questions, the uptake of MIPD has been modest in healthcare. The success of PK modeling in industry has been made possible through collaborative efforts between regulators, industry and academia. Collaboration between academia, healthcare and industry, and financial support for research into patient benefit, cost-benefit and clinical effectiveness of these approaches is imperative for wider adaption of PK modeling in precision dosing of anticancer drugs."
Undescended testis? How best to teach the physical examination,JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC UROLOGY,"Background Undescended testis in boys is common. Guidelines recommend surgical treatment between the ages of 6 months and 2 years; nevertheless, orchidopexy is frequently performed at later ages. One reason is the belated diagnosis due to a perceived difficulty in the physical examination (PE) and correct localization of the testis. Objectives We aimed to find an effective method for teaching the physical examination of the testis in a child. Study design An interdisciplinary team developed teaching sessions, including an educational video and a simulator. Medical students (n = 133) were randomized into three groups: self-study only, video, and video and simulator. The sessions were carried out and quantitative feedback was collected from the teachers and students. The learning achievements of the different groups were assessed with an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). The differences in mean OSCE results between all three groups were tested using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). For multiple pairwise comparisons, a closed testing procedure was performed using unpaired t-tests. Results The self-study only group acquired the poorest results in the OSCE, with a mean score of 5.1 out of 10. The video-only-group reached a mean of 6.7, and the video-and-simulator group performed best with a mean score of 8.5. The differences between all three groups were found to be statistically significant, with P = 0.007. The attached figure illustrates this data. If analyzed in pairs, this difference was particularly apparent between the groups self-study only vs video and simulator, with P = 0.002. Qualitative feedback revealed doubtful effectiveness for educational videos, but positive reactions to training on a simulator. Discussion The poor results of the self-study-only group were in accordance with the literature, where textbook learning was found not to increase OSCE results. The effectiveness of video tutorials remains doubtful; studies focusing on this teaching method are divergent and the present students' feedback supports this data. The effective teaching with the simulator has been proven for other skills (i.e. ultrasound skills). The analyzed cohort for this study was small, and the study should be repeated at different institutions and with larger numbers of students to assure generalizability. Conclusions Low-fidelity pediatric simulators with palpable testis are available and are able to improve examining skills in medical students. We hope the presented study inspires medical educators in their teaching of the PE of the pediatric testis."
Teaching Residents the Two-Challenge Rule: A Simulation-Based Approach to Improve Education and Patient Safety,SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE-JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE,"Introduction: Residents train in a historically hierarchical system. They may be compelled to question their teachers if they do not understand or disagree with a clinical decision, have a patient safety concern, or when treatment plans are unclear. We sought to determine whether a debriefing intervention that emphasizes (1) joint responsibility for safety and (2) the two-challenge rule (a rubric for challenging others) using a conversational technique that is assertive and collaborative (advocacy-inquiry) can improve the frequency and effectiveness with which residents speak up to superiors. Methods: In a simulated operating room, anesthesiology trainees were presented with opportunities to challenge coworkers (eg, orders to administer a relatively contraindicated medication). Opportunities to challenge the attending faculty anesthesiologist, attending faculty surgeon, and nurse (all confederates) were presented. When debriefed, subjects were taught the two-challenge rule and a communication technique that paired advocacy (stating trainee's observation) and inquiry (request for the other's reasoning). A second scenario offered new opportunities to challenge. Video recorded scenarios were evaluated by two investigators and trainee use of the prescribed advocacy-inquiry language was rated on a 5-point scale. Results: Forty subjects participated. Overall use of the two-challenge rule and advocacy-inquiry increased after debriefing. The debriefing and instruction specifically improved the frequency and quality of challenges directed toward superordinate physicians, without improving resident challenges toward nurses. Conclusions: This instructional intervention improves speaking up by residents to other physicians during simulated obstetric cases. Providing increased opportunities for resident learning, sharing responsibility for patient safety, and overcoming communication barriers within the medical hierarchy may improve teamwork and patient safety.

Beyond crisis resource management: new frontiers in human factors training for acute care medicine,CURRENT OPINION IN ANESTHESIOLOGY,"Purpose of reviewError is ubiquitous in medicine, particularly during critical events and resuscitation. A significant proportion of adverse events can be attributed to inadequate team-based skills such as communication, leadership, situation awareness and resource utilization. Aviation-based crisis resource management (CRM) training using high-fidelity simulation has been proposed as a strategy to improve team behaviours. This review will address key considerations in CRM training and outline recommendations for the future of human factors education in healthcare.Recent findingsA critical examination of the current literature yields several important considerations to guide the development and implementation of effective simulation-based CRM training. These include defining a priori domain-specific objectives, creating an immersive environment that encourages deliberate practice and transfer-appropriate processing, and the importance of effective team debriefing. Building on research from high-risk industry, we suggest that traditional CRM training may be augmented with new training techniques that promote the development of shared mental models for team and task processes, address the effect of acute stress on team performance, and integrate strategies to improve clinical reasoning and the detection of cognitive errors.SummaryThe evolution of CRM training involves a Triple Threat' approach that integrates mental model theory for team and task processes, training for stressful situations and metacognition and error theory towards a more comprehensive training paradigm, with roots in high-risk industry and cognitive psychology. Further research is required to evaluate the impact of this approach on patient-oriented outcomes."
Preparing undergraduate students for clinical work in a complex environment: evaluation of an e-learning module on physiotherapy in the intensive care unit,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,"BackgroundIntensive Care Units (ICUs) are daunting environments for physiotherapy (PT) students performing clinical rotations. To prepare students for this environment, a newly developed, evidence-based e-learning module was designed and implemented in the undergraduate curriculum. The aim of this study was to investigate whether e-learning is a feasible method in preparing PT students for clinical work in complex ICU environments, as perceived by students and experts.MethodsA mixed methods proof of concept study was undertaken. Participants were final-year students of an international curriculum, and experts from didactic and clinical fields. An e-learning module consisting of 7 separate chapters based on the latest scientific evidence and clinical expertise was developed, piloted and incorporated into the undergraduate curriculum as a compulsory course to be completed prior to clinical ICU rotations. Data were collected through 3 focus group meetings and 5 semi-structured interviews; these meetings and interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed.ResultsThe study sample comprised of 14 students and 5 experts. Thematic analysis revealed three themes: expected competencies of PT students in ICU, feeling prepared for ICU clinical work and dealing with local variety. The e-learning module enabled students to anticipate clinical situations and PT tasks in the ICU. Higher level clinical reasoning skills, handling of lines and wires and dealing with out-of-textbook situations could not be achieved with the e-learning module alone.ConclusionsAn e-learning module can sufficiently prepare PT students for their clinical tasks in the ICU, as long as it is integrated with, or closely connected to, the students' clinical placement."
Short lessons in basic life support improve self-assurance in performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation,WORLD JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE,"BACKGROUND: There are several reasons why resuscitation measures may lead to inferior results: difficulties in team building, delayed realization of the emergency and interruption of chest compression. This study investigated the outcome of a new form of in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training with special focus on changes in self-assurance of potential helpers when faced with emergency situations. METHODS: Following a 12-month period of CPR training, questionnaires were distributed to participants and non-participants. Those non-participants who intended to undergo the training at a later date served as control group. RESULTS: The study showed that participants experienced a significant improvement in self-assurance, compared with their remembered self-assurance before the training. Their self-assurance also was significantly greater than that of the control group of non-participants. CONCLUSION: Short lessons in CPR have an impact on the self-assurance of medical and non-medical personnel."
Time to give the first medication during resuscitation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,RESUSCITATION,"Objective: There is no evidence showing an impact from any advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) medications on patient survival following cardiac arrest. One potential reason for a lack of such benefit may be medication timing. We formed the hypothesis that medications are given Late after rescuer arrival, Limiting any benefit. We performed a meta-analysis to determine the time from emergency medical services (EMS) dispatch to first medication administration, regardless of route, during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA). Then, the mean time and ranges of reported study medication delivery in clinical trials where medication was the experimental intervention was determined. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature review between January 1990 and August 2005 in MEDLINE using the following MeSH headings: cardiopulmonary resuscitation, cardiac arrest, heart arrest, EMS, EMT, ambulance, and the names of all ACLS medications. We reviewed the abstracts of 632 studies and full manuscripts of 248 published papers. We eliminated the following articles from further analysis: non-peer reviewed; all without human primary data (includes review articles, guidelines or consensus manuscripts, editorials, or simulation studies); animal data; case reports. We used no Language restriction. From this search, our independent reviewers found 17 papers that contained information on time to medication administration. Results: We analyzed reporting of drug delivery time to 7617 patients in 32 different emergency medical services systems. Time to first medication delivery by any route was a mean of 17.7 min (range 10.0-25.0; 95% Cl around mean 10.6, 24.8). Time to intravenous experimental medication administration was a mean of 19.4 min (range 13.3-25.0; 95% Cl around mean 12.8, 25.9). Conclusions: Medications are given late during out-of-hospital[ cardiac arrest, even in cohorts where drug delivery is a key study intervention. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Three-dimensional cardiac computational modelling: methods, features and applications",BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE,"The combination of computational models and biophysical simulations can help to interpret an array of experimental data and contribute to the understanding, diagnosis and treatment of complex diseases such as cardiac arrhythmias. For this reason, three-dimensional (3D) cardiac computational modelling is currently a rising field of research. The advance of medical imaging technology over the last decades has allowed the evolution from generic to patient-specific 3D cardiac models that faithfully represent the anatomy and different cardiac features of a given alive subject. Here we analyse sixty representative 3D cardiac computational models developed and published during the last fifty years, describing their information sources, features, development methods and online availability. This paper also reviews the necessary components to build a 3D computational model of the heart aimed at biophysical simulation, paying especial attention to cardiac electrophysiology (EP), and the existing approaches to incorporate those components. We assess the challenges associated to the different steps of the building process, from the processing of raw clinical or biological data to the final application, including image segmentation, inclusion of substructures and meshing among others. We briefly outline the personalisation approaches that are currently available in 3D cardiac computational modelling. Finally, we present examples of several specific applications, mainly related to cardiac EP simulation and model-based image analysis, showing the potential usefulness of 3D cardiac computational modelling into clinical environments as a tool to aid in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cardiac diseases."
E-learning and deliberate practice for oral case presentation skills: A randomized trial,MEDICAL TEACHER,"Background: Oral case presentations are critical for patient care and student assessment. The best method to prepare early medical students for oral presentations is unknown. Aim: We aimed to develop and evaluate a curriculum of on-line learning and deliberate practice to improve pre-clinical students' case presentation skills. Methods: We developed a web-based, interactive curriculum emphasizing conciseness and clinical reasoning. Using a waitlist control design, we randomly assigned groups of second-year students to receive the curriculum in December 2010 or in April 2011. We evaluated their presentations at three time points. We also examined the performance of an untrained class of students as a historical comparison. Results: We evaluated 132 second-year medical students at three time points. After the curriculum, mean scores of the intervention students improved from 60.2% to 70.1%, while scores of the waitlist control students improved less, from 61.8% to 64.5% (p < 0.01 for between-group difference in improvement). Once all students had received the curriculum, mean scores for the intervention and waitlist control students rose to 77.8% and 78.4%, respectively, compared to 68.1% for the untrained comparison students (p < 0.0001 compared to all curriculum students). Conclusion: An on-line curriculum followed by deliberate practice improved students' oral presentation skills."
The cost-effectiveness of alendronate in the management of osteoporosis,BONE,"The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK has recently issued health economic appraisals for the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fracture that are more restrictive than previous guidelines for the management of osteoporosis despite a marked reduction of the cost of intervention. The aim of the present study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of the bisphosphonate, alendronate for the prevention and treatment of fractures associated with osteoporosis. A second aim was to investigate reasons for any disparities in cost-effectiveness between our findings and the NICE appraisals. We compared the effects of alendronate 70 mg weekly by mouth for 5 years with no treatment in postmenopausal women with clinical risk factors for fracture and computed the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) using a lifetime simulation model based on Markov cohort methodology. A sensitivity analysis examined other common interventions. Using a threshold of (sic)30,000 and (sic)20,000 per quality of life-year (QALY) gained to determine cost-effectiveness, alendronate was cost-effective for the primary prevention of fracture in women with osteoporosis irrespective of age as was treatment of women with a prior fragility fracture irrespective of BMD. Cost-effective scenarios were also found in women with strong risk factors for fracture with a bone mineral density value above the threshold for osteoporosis. The results were robust over reasonable assumptions in sensitivity analysis. We conclude that alendronate is a cost-effective agent for the prevention and treatment of fractures associated with osteoporosis. These findings, suitable for informing practice guidance, contrast with recent appraisals from 0NICE. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"Managing the deteriorating patient in a simulated environment: nursing students' knowledge, skill and situation awareness",JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING,"Aim. To examine, in a simulated environment, the ability of final-year nursing students to assess, identify and respond to patients either deteriorating or at risk of deterioration. Background. The early identification and management of patient deterioration has a major impact on patient outcomes. 'Failure to rescue' is of international concern, with significant concerns over nurses' ability to detect deterioration, the reasons for which are unknown. Design. Mixed methods incorporating quantitative measures of performance (knowledge, skill and situation awareness) and, to be reported at a later date, a qualitative reflective review of decision processes. Methods. Fifty-one final-year, final-semester student nurses attended a simulation laboratory. Students completed a knowledge questionnaire and two video-recorded simulated scenarios (mannequin based) to assess skill performance. The scenarios simulated deteriorating patients with hypovolaemic and septic shock. Situation awareness was measured by randomly stopping each scenario and asking a series of questions relating to the situation. Results. The mean knowledge score was 74% (range 46-100%) and the mean skill performance score across both scenarios was 60% (range 30-78%). Skill performance improved significantly (p < 0 center dot 01) by the second scenario. However, skill performance declined significantly in both scenarios as the patient's condition deteriorated (hypovolaemia scenario: p = 0 center dot 012, septic scenario: p = 0 center dot 000). The mean situation awareness score across both scenarios was 59% (range 38-82%). Participants tended to identify physiological indicators of deterioration (77%) but had low comprehension scores (44%). Conclusion. Knowledge scores suggest, on average, a satisfactory academic preparation, but this study identified significant deficits in students' ability to manage patient deterioration. Relevance to clinical practice. This study suggests that student nurses, at the point of qualification, may be inadequately prepared to identify and manage deteriorating patients in the clinical setting."
Modeling and simulation of right ventricular volume measurement system during right heart catheterization,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS,"Haemodynamic monitoring is necessary for the effective management of critically ill cardiac patients. Pulmonary artery catheterization has been used for monitoring the circulation, for measurement of intracardiac pressures and to estimate preload and afterload. However, pressures may not be accurate reflection of the circulation and simultaneous measurement of volumes would improve patient treatment. However, measurement of cardiac volumes especially of the right ventricle is difficult in everyday clinical practice In this work we propose the use of pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) with ultrasonic sensors built on it, to calculate the right ventricular end-diastolic (RVEDV) and end-systolic volume (RVESV). This is achieved by using the Ultrasonic (US) beam, to measure the distances between the transducers on the catheter and the RV walls. These distances, will be used as an input to a Volume calculating algorithm, which finally provides the RVEDV and RVESV, using a Neural Network (NN). For that reason, we have used cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and have modeled the catheter and the US transducers, to get as input the distances to the surface of the cavity. With these distances, and the known cardiac volumes (calculated using MR images) we trained and validated a NN for volume calculation. The results show that the algorithm accurately calculates the RVEDV. For the RVESV, greater deviations are observed between values calculated with our algorithm and cardiac MRI."
Computational Fluid Dynamics in Cardiovascular Disease,KOREAN CIRCULATION JOURNAL,"Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a mechanical engineering field for analyzing fluid flow, heat transfer, and associated phenomena, using computer-based simulation. CFD is a widely adopted methodology for solving complex problems in many modern engineering fields. The merit of CFD is developing new and improved devices and system designs, and optimization is conducted on existing equipment through computational simulations, resulting in enhanced efficiency and lower operating costs. However, in the biomedical field, CFD is still emerging. The main reason why CFD in the biomedical field has lagged behind is the tremendous complexity of human body fluid behavior. Recently, CFD biomedical research is more accessible, because high performance hardware and software are easily available with advances in computer science. All CFD processes contain three main components to provide useful information, such as pre-processing, solving mathematical equations, and post-processing. Initial accurate geometric modeling and boundary conditions are essential to achieve adequate results. Medical imaging, such as ultrasound imaging, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging can be used for modeling, and Doppler ultrasound, pressure wire, and non-invasive pressure measurements are used for flow velocity and pressure as a boundary condition. Many simulations and clinical results have been used to study congenital heart disease, heart failure, ventricle function, aortic disease, and carotid and intra-cranial cerebrovascular diseases. With decreasing hardware costs and rapid computing times, researchers and medical scientists may increasingly use this reliable CFD tool to deliver accurate results. A realistic, multidisciplinary approach is essential to accomplish these tasks. Indefinite collaborations between mechanical engineers and clinical and medical scientists are essential. CFD may be an important methodology to understand the pathophysiology of the development and progression of disease and for establishing and creating treatment modalities in the cardiovascular field."
Attrition Bias Related to Missing Outcome Data: A Longitudinal Simulation Study,EPIDEMIOLOGY,"Background: Most longitudinal studies do not address potential selection biases due to selective attrition. Using empirical data and simulating additional attrition, we investigated the effectiveness of common approaches to handle missing outcome data from attrition in the association between individual education level and change in body mass index (BMI). Methods: Using data from the two waves of the French RECORD Cohort Study (N = 7,172), we first examined how inverse probability weighting (IPW) and multiple imputation handled missing outcome data from attrition in the observed data (stage 1). Second, simulating additional missing data in BMI at follow-up under various missing-at-random scenarios, we quantified the impact of attrition and assessed how multiple imputation performed compared to complete case analysis and to a perfectly specified IPW model as a gold standard (stage 2). Results: With the observed data in stage 1, we found an inverse association between individual education and change in BMI, with complete case analysis, as well as with IPW and multiple imputation. When we simulated additional attrition under a missing-at-random pattern (stage 2), the bias increased with the magnitude of selective attrition, and multiple imputation was useless to address it. Conclusions: Our simulations revealed that selective attrition in the outcome heavily biased the association of interest. The present article contributes to raising awareness that for missing outcome data, multiple imputation does not do better than complete case analysis. More effort is thus needed during the design phase to understand attrition mechanisms by collecting information on the reasons for dropout."

Group sequential methods for an ordinal logistic random-effects model under misspecification,BIOMETRICS,"Interim analyses in clinical trials are planned for ethical as well as economic reasons. General results have been published in the literature that allow the use of standard group sequential methodology if one uses an efficient test statistic, e.g., when Wald-type statistics are used in random-effects models for ordinal longitudinal data. These models often assume that the random effects are normally distributed. However; this is not always the case. We will show that, when the random-effects distribution is misspecified in ordinal regression models; the joint distribution of the test statistics over the different interim analyses is still a multivariate normal distribution, but a sandwich-type correction to the covariance matrix is needed in order to obtain the correct covariance matrix. The independent increment structure is also investigated. A bias in estimation will occur due to the misspecification. However, we will also show that the treatment effect estimate will be unbiased under the null hypothesis, thus maintaining the type I error. Extensive simulations based on a toenail dermatophyte onychomycosis trial are used to illustrate our results."
Analysing the reasons of failure of surgical mitral repair approaches-do we need to better think in biomechanics?,JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE,"The failure of mitral valve repair procedures revealed in the outcomes of the recent randomized studies is suggesting the necessity for a better understanding of the biomechanical mechanisms underlying the failure of the surgical approaches. Use of biomechanical modelling and finite element analysis (FEA) in cardiovascular research is an important aid in this context. In our group we developed a biomechanical model taking into account all the component of the mitral valve functional unit including the valve leaflets, the annulus, the papillary muscles, the chordae tendinea and the ventricular geometry. The two-dimensional mathematical model was capable to predict some of the actual geometrical and mechanical features of the valvular and subvalvular apparatuses in physiological and pathological conditions providing the engineering quantitative relations between closing and tethering forces and the mechanisms governing the mitral valve unit function. This model might further become patient-specific by means of 3D reconstruction of clinical imaging. Images are first converted in a standard vector format (DICOM, etc.), then automatically translated in a structural finite element model and finally implemented in a finite element code. This allows for in silico simulations to virtually explore the effects of different surgical approaches at an early stage after the procedure, to help the operative decision processes, or to optimize the design of surgical implants."
Bridging the gap between complexity science and clinical practice by formalizing idiographic theories: a computational model of functional analysis,BMC MEDICINE,"Background: The past decades of research have seen an increase in statistical tools to explore the complex dynamics of mental health from patient data, yet the application of these tools in clinical practice remains uncommon. This is surprising, given that clinical reasoning, e.g., case conceptualizations, largely coincides with the dynamical system approach. We argue that the gap between statistical tools and clinical practice can partly be explained by the fact that current estimation techniques disregard theoretical and practical considerations relevant to psychotherapy. To address this issue, we propose that case conceptualizations should be formalized. We illustrate this approach by introducing a computational model of functional analysis, a framework commonly used by practitioners to formulate case conceptualizations and design patient-tailored treatment. Methods: We outline the general approach of formalizing idiographic theories, drawing on the example of a functional analysis for a patient suffering from panic disorder. We specified the system using a series of differential equations and simulated different scenarios; first, we simulated data without intervening in the system to examine the effects of avoidant coping on the development of panic symptomatic. Second, we formalized two interventions commonly used in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; exposure and cognitive reappraisal) and subsequently simulated their effects on the system. Results: The first simulation showed that the specified system could recover several aspects of the phenomenon (panic disorder), however, also showed some incongruency with the nature of panic attacks (e.g., rapid decreases were not observed). The second simulation study illustrated differential effects of CBT interventions for this patient. All tested interventions could decrease panic levels in the system. Conclusions: Formalizing idiographic theories is promising in bridging the gap between complexity science and clinical practice and can help foster more rigorous scientific practices in psychotherapy, through enhancing theory development. More precise case conceptualizations could potentially improve intervention planning and treatment outcomes. We discuss applications in psychotherapy and future directions, amongst others barriers for systematic theory evaluation and extending the framework to incorporate interactions between individual systems, relevant for modeling social learning processes. With this report, we hope to stimulate future efforts in formalizing clinical frameworks."
A comparison of methods for sample size estimation for non-inferiority studies with binary outcomes,STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH,"Non-inferiority trials are motivated in the context of clinical research where a proven active treatment exists and placebo-controlled trials are no longer acceptable for ethical reasons. Instead, active-controlled trials are conducted where a treatment is compared to an established treatment with the objective of demonstrating that it is non-inferior to this treatment. We review and compare the methodologies for calculating sample sizes and suggest appropriate methods to use. We demonstrate how the simplest method of using the anticipated response is predominantly consistent with simulations. In the context of trials with binary outcomes with expected high proportions of positive responses, we show how the sample size is quite sensitive to assumptions about the control response. We recommend when designing such a study that sensitivity analyses be performed with respect to the underlying assumptions and that the Bayesian methods described in this article be adopted to assess sample size."
Comparison of safety insertion techniques of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy in nurses and physicians - a non-randomized interventional pilot study on a simulation model,ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GASTROENTEROLOGIE,"Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion represents a standardized procedure for enteral nutrition in patients with long-term eating difficulties for various reasons. In a clinical setting, delegation of stomach puncture and placement of a PEG tube, within the context of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy amongst nurses, occurs. In Germany, there are no studies yet showing the differences between physicians and nurses regarding the safety of percutaneous stomach puncture. In a non-randomized quasi-experimental interventional study on a simulation model, the safety of stomach puncture within the context of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy between physicians and nurses with special training was compared. Technical skills were recorded with video cameras and provided the basis for the following analysis. The study contained: (1) a theoretical preparation phase, (2) training on simulation model and a repeated practice of the skills, and (3) stomach puncture on the simulation model. The actions were recorded with a multichannel video technique. As part of the concept, nurses and physicians were trained together in theory and practice. The analysis was conducted with the newly designed Assessment Instrument Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (AS-PEG). Seven physicians and 17 nurses took part in the pilot study. On average, the physicians reached a score of 36.4 +/- 2.2 (33 - 39) and nurses 37.4 +/- 2 (32 - 40), while the maximum score was 42. The evaluation of technical skills on the recorded videos by means of Assessment Instrument Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (AS-PEG) showed no tendency to significant differences between physicians and nurses after theoretical and practical training. The study contributes a first objective evaluation of technical skills on stomach puncture within the context of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with the newly designed AS-PEG."
Influence of the load of a rider or of a region with increased stiffness on the equine back: a modelling study,EQUINE VETERINARY JOURNAL,"Reasons for performing study: Knowledge of load effects is crucial for the understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of equine back problems. Objective: To investigate different load scenarios of the equine back, such as being ridden or increased muscle tone, using biomechanical simulations. Methods: Kinetic and kinematic data of 15 sound horses and the electromyelograph of their long back muscles were recorded. A biomechanical simulation model was used for simulations under different biomechanical scenarios (ridden/unridden, localised increased stiffness) using ADAMS. Results: The vertical forces acting through a rider were: walk 3.83 N/kg, trot 5.18 N/kg and gallop 5.60 N/kg. No significant changes in transversal forces were found between ridden and unridden horses. Profound changes were seen in the torques at the segment following a region of increased stiffness: in walk, lateral peak torques increased from 342 to 1723 Nm, and in trot from 393 to 1004 Nm, and dorsoventral from 386 to 3705 Nm (walk) and 458 to 4340 Nm (trot). Conclusions and potential relevance: The simulation shows that the stress of a rider is lower than that of pathological processes such as partial increased stiffness of the back. Study of revised models with improved anatomical realism might help to raise the plausibility of model results."
Testing of microbial contamination during the preparation of the radiocompound [Y-90]DOTATOC for clinical trials: a process validation study by Media Fill approach,QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING,"Aim. Radioisotopes used in nuclear radiopharmacy possess short half-lives, not allowing enough time to wait for completion of sterility tests. Moreover, carrying out sterility tests on highly radioactive solutions inside the hospital microbiology laboratory arises concerns about radioprotection. Therefore, the release of radiopharmaceuticals for injection is allowed in microbial analysis. For this reason, the effectiveness of the aseptic procedures has to be continuously assessed in order to guarantee the safety of the drug. The aim of this study was to validate the sterile preparation of [Y-90]DOTATOC by means of media fill test. Methods. In order to validate the process, a simulation test was used: the media fill test. To apply this method, operators simulated each step of the process using culture medium (Triptic Soy Broth, TSB) instead of actual radiopharmaceutical product. Media fill test procedure has been subdivided into 5 phases, from the simulation of reagent preparation through the dispensing operations up to ward delivery. After every step, the processed medium was incubated at 35 degrees C for 14 days. If the compounding procedures are adequately performed, no growth of microorganisms will be detected. Results. Microbiological analyses, carried out on all vials obtained at the end of each step, showed no microbial growth. For this reason, sterility tests were considered satisfactory. Conclusion. Application of media-fill test allowed both to validate operative modality used for [Y-90]-DOTATOC handling and to attest the ability of operators who worked on it. Additionally, a correct quality control of the radiopharmaceutical i.v. preparations allows clinic infections control and prevention."
Exploring patterns of error in acute care using framework analysis,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background: Junior doctors are often the first responders to deteriorating patients in hospital. In the high-stakes and time-pressured context of acute care, the propensity for error is high. This study aimed to identify the main subject areas in which junior doctors' acute care errors occur, and cross-reference the errors with Reason's Generic Error Modelling System (GEMS). GEMS categorises errors according to the underlying cognitive processes, and thus provides insight into the causative factors. The overall aim of this study was to identify patterns in junior doctors' acute care errors in order to enhance understanding and guide the development of educational strategies. Methods: This observational study utilised simulated acute care scenarios involving junior doctors dealing with a range of emergencies. Scenarios and the subsequent debriefs were video-recorded. Framework analysis was used to categorise the errors according to eight inductively-developed key subject areas. Subsequently, a multi-dimensional analysis was performed which cross-referenced the key subject areas with an earlier categorisation of the same errors using GEMS. The numbers of errors in each category were used to identify patterns of error. Results: Eight key subject areas were identified; hospital systems, prioritisation, treatment, ethical principles, procedural skills, communication, situation awareness and infection control. There was a predominance of rule-based mistakes in relation to the key subject areas of hospital systems, prioritisation, treatment and ethical principles. In contrast, procedural skills, communication and situation awareness were more closely associated with skill-based slips and lapses. Knowledge-based mistakes were less frequent but occurred in relation to hospital systems and procedural skills. Conclusions: In order to improve the management of acutely unwell patients by junior doctors, medical educators must understand the causes of common errors. Adequate knowledge alone does not ensure prompt and appropriate management and referral. The teaching of acute care skills may be enhanced by encouraging medical educators to consider the range of potential error types, and their relationships to particular tasks and subjects. Rule-based mistakes may be amenable to simulation-based training, whereas skill-based slips and lapses may be reduced using strategies designed to raise awareness of the interplay between emotion, cognition and behaviour."
Distribution based nearest neighbor imputation for truncated high dimensional data with applications to pre-clinical and clinical metabolomics studies,BMC BIOINFORMATICS,"Background: High throughput metabolomics makes it possible to measure the relative abundances of numerous metabolites in biological samples, which is useful to many areas of biomedical research. However, missing values (MVs) in metabolomics datasets are common and can arise due to both technical and biological reasons. Typically, such MVs are substituted by a minimum value, which may lead to different results in downstream analyses. Results: Here we present a modified version of the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) approach which accounts for truncation at the minimum value, i.e., KNN truncation (KNN-TN). We compare imputation results based on KNN-TN with results from other KNN approaches such as KNN based on correlation (KNN-CR) and KNN based on Euclidean distance (KNN-EU). Our approach assumes that the data follow a truncated normal distribution with the truncation point at the detection limit (LOD). The effectiveness of each approach was analyzed by the root mean square error (RMSE) measure as well as the metabolite list concordance index (MLCI) for influence on downstream statistical testing. Through extensive simulation studies and application to three real data sets, we show that KNN-TN has lower RMSE values compared to the other two KNN procedures as well as simpler imputation methods based on substituting missing values with the metabolite mean, zero values, or the LOD. MLCI values between KNN-TN and KNN-EU were roughly equivalent, and superior to the other four methods in most cases. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that KNN-TN generally has improved performance in imputing the missing values of the different datasets compared to KNN-CR and KNN-EU when there is missingness due to missing at random combined with an LOD. The results shown in this study are in the field of metabolomics but this method could be applicable with any high throughput technology which has missing due to LOD."
Curriculum integration of virtual patients,CURRENTS IN PHARMACY TEACHING AND LEARNING,"Background and purpose: Virtual patients (VP) offer an enhanced learning experience for students to assume the role of health professional and make therapeutic decisions in a simulated environment. While VPs are valued by students and offer benefits to the learner, little is known about how best to implement them in pharmacy education curricula. The purpose of our study was to investigate students' perceptions of VPs and build understanding about how to optimally implement them in the future. Educational activity and setting: Four VP cases were implemented over the first three years of the entry to practice doctor of pharmacy program. Each case was focused on a different condition and implemented in one of three settings (i.e. integration activities, large lecture setting, or independent review). Students were invited to complete a survey and participate in a focus group after completing the patient case. Findings: One-hundred eighty students completed the survey and six students participated in a focus group. Ninety-four percent of respondents strongly agreed/agreed that VPs were valuable for their learning. Students preferred the VP cases be implemented in small-group settings and be relevantly timed with course material. Students found helpful that cases were realistic, clear, comprehensive, engaging, and incorporated feedback. Perceived benefits included enhanced learning about medical conditions, development of clinical reasoning skills and processes for working through cases. Summary: VPs continue to be identified as a valuable learning experience. When implemented it is important to consider the learner setting in order to get the greatest value from their use."
MODEL-BASED RHYTHM ANALYSIS OF THE ECG - EVALUATION OF A PROTOTYPE IMPLEMENTATION,JOURNAL OF ELECTROCARDIOLOGY,"Current computer algorithms that interpret cardiac rhythms based solely on the surface electrocardiogram are limited, yet offer many benefits to health care. To address the limitations, novel computer algorithms for the automatic diagnosis of complex cardiac rhythms based solely on the surface electrocardiogram are presented. Using the hypothesize-and-test paradigm, a physiologic model of the cardiac conduction system and production rule-based knowledge are combined to reason about the time- and space-varying characteristics of complex heart rhythms. In addition, an evaluation of a prototype implementation of the algorithms is presented. A database of the time of onset, width, and shape classifications of each P wave, QRS complex, and T wave from 59 electrocardiographic strips was developed from an introductory textbook by hand-annotation using calipers. The database was not used in the development of the prototype. The prototype's diagnoses were reviewed by a clinical cardiac electrophysiologist who was not involved in the development process. Pair-wise comparisons among the prototype, textbook, and cardiac electrophysiologist, assuming either the textbook or electrophysiologist as the gold standard, were performed. The specific comparisons performed were prototype versus textbook, electrophysiologist versus textbook, prototype versus electrophysiologist, and textbook versus electrophysiologist. For all diagnostic categories, sensitivities of 88.0%, 97.2%, 78.6%, and 82.1%, respectively, and specificities of 99.2%, 98.5%, 99.7%, and 99.8%, respectively, were attained. When accounting for design and implementation limitations of the prototype, sensitivities of 93.0%, 98.5%, 89.1%, and 92.7%, respectively, and specificities of 99.4%, 99.2%, 99.6%, and 99.8%, respectively, were attained. The results indicate that these algorithms offer clinical advantages over currently available arrhythmia analysis systems."
"A Survey of the Way Pharmacokinetics are Reported in Published Phase I Clinical Trials, with an Emphasis on Oncology",CLINICAL PHARMACOKINETICS,"Background and objective: During the drug development process, phase 1 trials are the first occasion to study the pharmacokinetics of a drug. They are performed in healthy subjects, or in patients in oncology, and are designed to determine a safe and acceptable dose for the later phases of clinical trials. We performed a bibliographic survey to investigate the way pharmacokinetics are described and reported in phase I clinical trials. Methods: We performed a MEDLINE search to retrieve the list of papers published between 2005 and 2006 and reporting phase I clinical trials with a pharmacokinetic study. We used a spreadsheet to record general information concerning the study and specific information regarding the pharmacokinetics, such as the sampling times, number of subjects and method of analysis. Results: The search yielded 349 papers, of which 37 were excluded for various reasons. Nearly all of the papers in our review concerned cancer studies, although this was not a requirement in the search. Consistent with the selection process, 84% papers explicitly stated pharmacokinetics as an objective of the study. The methods section usually included a description of the pharmacokinetics (88%), but 10% of the papers provided no information concerning the methods used for the pharmacokinetics and in 2% the description was only partial. The analytical method was usually basic, with non-compartmental or purely descriptive methods. Observed concentrations and areas under the concentration-time curves were the pharmacokinetic variables most often reported. The results of the pharmacokinetic study were frequently reported in a separate paragraph of the results section, and only 22% of the studies related the pharmacokinetic findings to other results from the study, such as toxicity or efficacy. In addition, important information such as the number of subjects included in the pharmacokinetic study or the pharmacokinetic sampling scheme was sometimes not reported explicitly. Conclusion: Concerns about the decreasing cost-effectiveness of the drug development process prompted the regulatory authorities to recently recommend better integration of all available information - including, in particular, pharmacokinetics-in this process. In our review, we found that this information was often either missing or incomplete, which hinders that objective. We suggest several improvements in the design and the reporting of the methods and results of these studies, to ensure that all relevant information has been included. Pharmacokinetic findings should also be integrated into the broader perspective of drug development, through the study of their relationship with toxicity and/or efficacy, even in the early phase I stages."
"Patient-Specific Modelling in Drug Design, Development and Selection Including its Role in Clinical Decision-Making",CHEMICAL BIOLOGY & DRUG DESIGN,"Genomics has made enormous progress in the twelve years since the publication of the first draft human genome sequence, but it has not yet been translated into the clinic. Despite spiralling development costs, the number of new drug registrations is not increasing. One reason for this lies in the genetic complexity of disease. Most diseases involve dysregulation in pathways that involve many genes, and many (including most cancers) are themselves genetically heterogeneous. Systems biology involves the multi-level simulation of physiology, cell biology and biochemistry using complex computational techniques. We show here using case studies in cancer and HIV how such computational models, and particularly models based on individual patient data, can be used for drug design and development, and in the selection of the appropriate treatment for a given patient in the face of resistance mutations. If these techniques are to be adopted in routine clinical practice, clinicians will need better training in modern approaches to the integrated analysis of large-scale heterogeneous data and multi-scale models, while developers will need to provide much more usable tools. Investment in computational infrastructure is needed so that results can be returned on clinically relevant timescales and data warehouses designed with data protection as well as accessibility in mind."
Improving the validity of script concordance testing by optimising and balancing items,MEDICAL EDUCATION,"BackgroundA script concordance test (SCT) is a modality for assessing clinical reasoning. Concerns had been raised about the plausible validity threat to SCT scores if students deliberately avoided the extreme answer options to obtain higher scores. The aims of the study were firstly to investigate whether students' avoidance of the extreme answer options could result in higher scores, and secondly to determine whether a balanced approach' by careful construction of SCT items (to include extreme as well as median options as model responses) would improve the validity of an SCT. MethodsUsing the paired sample t-test, the actual average student scores for 10 SCT papers from 2012-2016 were compared with simulated scores. The latter were generated by recoding all -2' responses to -1' and +2' responses to +1' for the whole and bottom 10% of the cohort (simulation 1), and scoring as if all students had chosen 0' for their responses (simulation 2). The actual average and simulated average scores in 2012 (before the balanced approach') were compared with those from 2013-2016, when papers had a good balance of modal responses from the expert reference panel. ResultsIn 2012, a score increase was seen in simulation 1 in the third-year cohort, from 50.2 to 55.6% (t [10]=4.818; p=0.001). Since 2013, with the balanced approach', the actual SCT scores (57.4%) were significantly higher than scores in both simulation 1 and simulation 2 (46.7% and 23.9% respectively). ConclusionsWhen constructing SCT examinations, apart from the rigorous pre-examination optimisation, it is desirable to achieve a balance between items that attract extreme responses and those that attract median response options. This could mitigate the validity threat to SCT scores, especially for the low-performing students who have previously been shown to only select median responses and avoid the extreme responses. The authors demonstrate that SCT score validity could be enhanced that have roughly equal distribution of answer options in expert reference panel's modal responses"
Is modeling stents still an important issue?,"INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON STENTS: MATERIALS, MECHANICS AND MANUFACTURING (ICS3M 2019)","Numerical models of cardiovascular devices have always appeared in literature studies few years after their use in clinical practice. As example, FDA approval of Palmaz-Schatz stent was in 1994, while the first numerical studies on a similar stent model appeared after 1999. The same temporal delay can be observed for degradable stents, transcatheter valves or more recently for devices like the stent retrievers. This observation does not necessarily mean that numerical modeling had not been used in the design of the stents or cardiovascular devices. Companies might have used numerical tools but not published the results. Was the publication activity committed mainly to the academic world? Or was the numerical modeling an exclusive academic activity until a few years ago? Modeling has intrinsic errors, while prototyping looks immune, as it is the natural design process for a company. The real world has always attracted more attention than the virtual world. Models are useful and the gap between the industrial production and numerical tools in the designing of devices is being reduced recently. Nowadays advances in medical images and augmentation of computer power allow to think of building real-time simulations as well as patient-specific models to be used to predict the device behavior; this is a plus that numerical modeling has over the traditional design process of cardiovascular devices. Furthermore, as in the past, the identification of new unknown problems/failures will always make the usage of numerical modeling a useful tool to explain the reasons of failure. The future in modeling stents is envisioned in their use for in silico trials and in the link between biology, engineering, and science. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier"
Structural and Energetic Analysis on the Complexes of Clinically Isolated Subtype C HIV-1 Proteases and Approved Inhibitors by Molecular Dynamics Simulation,JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B,"HIV-1 has a large genetic diversity. Subtype 13 HIV-1 is commonly found in patients in developed countries. In contrast, all increasing number of patients are infected with the non-B Subtype Viruses, especially with Subtype C HIV-1, in developing Countries. It remains to be clarified how mutations or polymorphisms in non-B Subtype HIV-1 influence the efficacy of the approved inhibitors. In this Study, we have performed molecular dynamics Simulations on clinically isolated subtype C HIV-1 proteases in complex with three kinds of approved inhibitors. From the structural and energetic viewpoints, we identified the polymorphisms influencing oil the binding of the inhibitors. The effect of the V821 Mutation Oil the association with chemicals and the reason for rare appearance of the D30N mutation in subtype C HIV-1 were discussed in terms of the change of geometry of the residues in HIV-1 protease."
"Calcium binding of the antifungal protein PAF: Structure, dynamics and function aspects by NMR and MD simulations",PLOS ONE,"Calcium ions (Ca2+) play an important role in the toxicity of the cysteine-rich and cationic antifungal protein PAF from Penicillium chrysogenum: high extracellular Ca2+ levels reduce the toxicity of PAF in the sensitive model fungus Neurospora crassa in a concentration dependent way. However, little is known about the mechanistic details of the Ca2+ ion impact and the Ca2+ binding capabilities of PAF outside the fungal cell, which might be the reason for the activity loss. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), isothermal titration calorimetry and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations we demonstrated that PAF weakly, but specifically binds Ca2+ ions. MD simulations of PAF predicted one major Ca2+ binding site at the C-terminus involving Asp53 and Asp55, while Asp19 was considered as putative Ca2+ binding site. The exchange of Asp19 to serine had little impact on the Ca2+ binding, however caused the loss of antifungal activity, as was shown in our recent study. Now we replaced the C-terminal aspartates and expressed the serine variant PAF(D53S/D55S). The specific Ca2+ binding affinity of PAF(D53S/D55S) decreased significantly if compared to PAF, whereas the antifungal activity was retained. To understand more details of Ca2+ interactions, we investigated the NMR and MD structure/dynamics of the free and Ca2+-bound PAF and PAF(D53S/D55S). Though we found some differences between these protein variants and the Ca2+ complexes, these effects cannot explain the observed Ca2+ influence. In conclusion, PAF binds Ca2+ ions selectively at the C-terminus; however, this Ca2+ binding does not seem to play a direct role in the previously documented modulation of the antifungal activity of PAF."
Simulation of different applicator positions for treatment of a presacral tumour,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYPERTHERMIA,"Introduction: Proximally located presacral recurrences of rectal carcinomas are known to be difficult to heat due to the complex anatomy of the pelvis, which reflect, shield and diffract the power. This study is to clarify whether a change of position of the Sigma-Eye applicator in this region can improve the heating. Material and methods: Finite element (FE) planning calculations were made for a phantom model with a proximal presacral tumour using a fixed 100 MHz radiofrequency radiation. Shifts of the applicator were simulated in 1 cm steps in x-(lateral), y-(posterior) and z- (longitudinal) direction. Computations also considered the network effects of the Sigma-Eye applicator. Optimisation of the phases and amplitudes for all positions were performed after solving the bioheat-transfer-equation. The parameters T-90, T-50, sensitivity, hot spot volume and total deposited power have been sampled for every applicator position with optimised plans and a standard plan. Results: The ability to heat a presacral tumour clearly depends on the applicator position, for standard antenna adjustment and also for optimised steering of the Sigma-Eye applicator. The y-direction (anterior-posterior) is very sensitive. Using optimised steering for each position, in z-direction (longitudinal), we found an unexpected additional optimum at 8 cm cranial from the middle position of the phantom. The x-direction (lateral) is in a clinical setting less important and shows only smaller changes of T-90 with an expected optimum in the central position. A positioning of the applicator in the axial and anterior position of the mid-pubic symphysis should be avoided for treatment of the presacral region, regardless of the used adjustment. Use of amplitude and phase optimisation yields better T-90 values than plans optimised only by phases, but they are much more sensitive for small variations of phases and amplitudes during a treatment, and the total power of the Sigma-Eye applicator can be restricted by the treatment software. Conclusions: Complex geometry of the human pelvis seems to be the reason for the difficulties to warm up the proximal presacral region. The assumption that every position can be balanced by a proper phase adaption, is true only in a small range. A centring of the applicator on the mid-pubic symphysis to heat this region should be avoided. From the practical point of view improved warming should be performed by optimisation of phases only."
A Conceptual and Empirical Examination of Justifications for Dichotomization,PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS,"Despite many articles reporting the problems of dichotomizing continuous measures, researchers still commonly use this practice. The authors' purpose in this article was to understand the reasons that people still dichotomize and to determine whether any of these reasons are valid. They contacted 66 researchers who had published articles using dichotomized variables and obtained their justifications for dichotomization. They also contacted 53 authors of articles published in Psychological Methods and asked them to identify any situations in which they believed dichotomized indicators could perform better. Justifications provided by these two groups fell into three broad categories, which the authors explored both logically and with Monte Carlo simulations. Continuous indicators were superior in the majority of circumstances and never performed substantially worse than the dichotomized indicators, but the simulations did reveal specific situations in which dichotomized indicators performed as well as or better than the original continuous indictors. The authors also considered several justifications for dichotomization that did not lend themselves to simulation, but in each case they found compelling arguments to address these situations using techniques other than dichotomization."
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis of cefoperazone/sulbactam for the treatment of pediatric sepsis by Monte Carlo simulation,ANALYTICAL METHODS,"Pediatric sepsis syndrome is one of the most common reasons for pediatric intensive care unit hospitalization (PICU). Cefoperazone/sulbactam is a time-dependent beta-lactamase inhibitor combination which has been widely used in the treatment of sepsis. But the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data of cefoperazone/sulbactam are unknown in children with sepsis. The present work aimed to determine whether the usual dosing regimens of cefoperazone/sulbactam (1 hour infusion, 50 mg kg(-1), every 12 hours) were suitable for these patients in PICU. A total of fourteen patients were enrolled and the PK parameters were estimated by non-compartmental analysis using WinNonlin software. The t(1/2) and AUC(0-12) of cefoperazone and sulbactam were 3.60 and 1.77 h, and 900.97 and 67.68 h mu g mL(-1), respectively. The Vd and CL of cefoperazone and sulbactam were 1.65 L and 5.16 L, and 17.41 mL min(-1) and 122.62 mL min(-1), respectively. The probability of target attainments (PTAs) of cefoperazone at different minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) based on the percentage time that concentrations exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (% T > MIC) value were performed by Monte Carlo simulation and PTA was >90% at MICs <= 16 mu g mL(-1). The PK/PD profile of dosing regimens tested will assist in selecting the appropriate cefoperazone/sulbactam regimens for these patients. At a target of 80% T > MIC, the usual dosing regimens can provide good coverage for pathogens with MICs of <= 32 mu g mL(-1). The ratio between cefoperazone and sulbactam at 1 : 1 may be more suitable in pediatric sepsis. Individual dose and therapeutic drug monitoring in clinical practice will help achieve the best therapeutic effect while minimizing toxicity."
Verification of Electroporation Models Using the Potato Tuber as In Vitro Simulation,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"Electrochemotherapy (ECT) and Irreversible Electroporation are recent non-thermal techniques employed for the treatment of tumors. These therapies are based on the opening of pores in the cell membrane during application of sufficiently high electric fields. Over the past two decades, clinical trials have validated these therapies in humans. Moreover, ECT has been successfully applied in several species in veterinary clinics. As the therapy depends on the electric field distribution, numerical models and in vitro experiments have an important role in better understanding electric field distribution in biological tissues, especially in anatomically and physiologically complex structures. The potato tuber has emerged as an option for testing the effectiveness of the new electrodes. Potatoes present advantages for several reasons: they are compatible with the 3Rs' concept for animal testing; they are simple to handle; and their electroporated areas become dark after 6-12h. In this work, we simulated four numerical models from the literature and compared them to in vitro experiments. Our aim was to determine the model that best describes the observable affected area. This is an important point because the models were developed to properly describe tissue variation in electrical conductivity during electroporation, not to determine how electroporation is manifested macroscopically in potato tissue. The area measured with the Miklavi-Ivorra-Suarez model was in closest agreement to the experiments; however, none of the models exactly represent our in vitro results."
Norwegian midwives' opinion of their midwifery education - a mixed methods study,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Background: Midwifery education in Norway has undergone radical reforms in the past few decades. In 2004, the compulsory year of paid internship was removed from the requirement to become an authorised midwife. Since then, authorisation as a midwife depends on the successful completion of a two-year full-time academic course, consisting of 50% clinical practice and 50% theoretical education. Our objective was to examine midwives' opinion of their Norwegian midwifery education in relation to their midwifery practice, comparing those educated with internship to those without. Methods: We performed a mixed-methods study based on data from a nationwide cross-sectional survey. A sample of 547 midwives completed a postal questionnaire, autumn 2014. Midwives were asked how they were educated, how their education prepared them for practice (multiple choice) and to freely comment on their midwifery education. Thematic analysis and descriptive and comparative analysis was used. Data sets were analysed independently and jointly interpreted. Results: Of our sample, 154 (28.2%) were educated through a two-year midwifery education without internship, while 393 (71.8%) had a one-year midwifery education with internship. Compared to midwives who had internship, midwives without were four times more likely to report that their education did not, or only partially prepare them for their work as a midwife. The association lost its significance when adjusted for experience as a midwife. According to the qualitative data, the primary reason for the association was insufficient clinical practice during education. Relevant clinical placement, ample practice time with good preceptorship and internship were proposed as methods to prepare for practice as a midwife. The theory-practice gap was highlighted as another hindrance to being prepared for practice. Conclusions: Academisation of the midwifery education has resulted in newly qualified midwives feeling less prepared for practice. Midwives would have liked more time for clinical practice and simulation training of core midwifery clinical skills included in the education. Midwifery educations need to explore ways to achieve a good balance between practice and theory. Workplaces need to explore alternative ways to internship to assist new graduates to become confident midwives with a strong midwifery identity."
Computerized Virtual Patients in Health Professions Education: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,"Purpose Educators increasingly use virtual patients (computerized clinical case simulations) in health professions training. The authors summarize the effect of virtual patients compared with no intervention and alternate instructional methods, and elucidate features of effective virtual patient design. Method The authors searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ERIC, PsychINFO, and Scopus through February 2009 for studies describing virtual patients for practicing and student physicians, nurses, and other health professionals. Reviewers, working in duplicate, abstracted information on instructional design and outcomes. Effect sizes were pooled using a random-effects model. Results Four qualitative, 18 no-intervention controlled, 21 noncomputer instruction-comparative, and 11 computer-assisted instruction-comparative studies were found. Heterogeneity was large (I-2 > 50%) in most analyses. Compared with no intervention, the pooled effect size (95% confidence interval; number of studies) was 0.94 (0.69 to 1.19; N = 11) for knowledge outcomes, 0.80 (0.52 to 1.08; N = 5) for clinical reasoning, and 0.90 (0.61 to 1.19; N = 9) for other skills. Compared with noncomputer instruction, pooled effect size (positive numbers favoring virtual patients) was -0.17 (-0.57 to 0.24; N = 8) for satisfaction, 0.06 (-0.14 to 0.25; N = 5) for knowledge, -0.004 (-0.30 to 0.29; N = 10) for reasoning, and 0.10 (-0.21 to 0.42; N = 11) for other skills. Comparisons of different virtual patient designs suggest that repetition until demonstration of mastery, advance organizers, enhanced feedback, and explicitly contrasting cases can improve learning outcomes. Conclusions Virtual patients are associated with large positive effects compared with no intervention. Effects in comparison with noncomputer instruction are on average small. Further research clarifying how to effectively implement virtual patients is needed."
A Descriptive Survey of Anesthesiology Residency Simulation Programs: How Are Programs Preparing Residents for the New American Board of Anesthesiology APPLIED Certification Examination?,ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA,"BACKGROUND: Anesthesiology residency programs may need new simulation-based programs to prepare residents for the new Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) component of the American Board of Anesthesiology (ABA) Primary Certification process. The design of such programs may require significant resources, including faculty time, expertise, and funding, as are currently needed for structured oral examination (SOE) preparation. This survey analyzed the current state of US-based anesthesiology residency programs regarding simulation-based educational programming for SOE and OSCE preparation. METHODS: An online survey was distributed to every anesthesiology residency program director in the United States. The survey included 15 to 46 questions, depending on each respondent's answers. The survey queried current practices and future plans regarding resident preparation specifically for the ABA APPLIED examination, with emphasis on the OSCE. Descriptive statistics were summarized..2 and Fisher exact tests were used to test the differences in proportions across groups. Spearman rank correlation was used to examine the association between ordinal variables. RESULTS: The responding 66 programs (49%) were a representative sample of all anesthesiology residencies (N = 136) in terms of geographical location (chi(2) P = .58). There was a low response rate from small programs that have 12 or fewer clinical anesthesia residents. Ninety-one percent (95% confidence interval [CI], 84%-95%) of responders agreed that it is the responsibility of the program to specifically prepare residents for primary certification, and most agreed that it is important to practice SOEs (94%; 95% CI, 88%-97%) and OSCEs (89%; 95% CI, 83%-94%). While 100% of respondents reported providing mock SOEs, only 31% (95% CI, 24%-40%) of respondents provided mock OSCE experiences. Of those without an OSCE program, 75% (95% CI, 64%-83%) reported plans to start one. The most common reasons for not having an OSCE program already in place, and the perceived challenges for implementing an OSCE program, were the same: lack of time (faculty and residents), expertise in OSCE development and assessment, and funding. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide data from residency programs for benchmarking their simulation curriculum and ABA APPLIED Examination preparation offerings. Despite agreement that residency programs should prepare residents for the ABA APPLIED Examination, many programs have yet to implement an OSCE preparation program, in part due to lack of financial resources, faculty expertise, and time. Additionally, in contrast to the SOE, the OSCE is a new format for ABA primary certification. As a result, the lack of consensus concerning preparation needs could be related to the amount information that is available regarding the examination content and assessment process."
Exploring the impact of cancer registry completeness on international cancer survival differences: a simulation study,BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER,"Background Data from population-based cancer registries are often used to compare cancer survival between countries or regions. The ICBP SURVMARK-2 study is an international partnership aiming to quantify and explore the reasons behind survival differences across high-income countries. However, the magnitude and relevance of differences in cancer survival between countries have been questioned, as it is argued that observed survival variations may be explained, at least in part, by differences in cancer registration practice, completeness and the availability and quality of the respective data sources. Methods As part of the ICBP SURVMARK-2 study, we used a simulation approach to better understand how differences in completeness, the characteristics of those missed and inclusion of cases found from death certificates can impact on cancer survival estimates. Results Bias in 1- and 5-year net survival estimates for 216 simulated scenarios is presented. Out of the investigated factors, the proportion of cases not registered through sources other than death certificates, had the largest impact on survival estimates. Conclusion Our results show that the differences in registration practice between participating countries could in our most extreme scenarios explain only a part of the largest observed differences in cancer survival."
Probing the acting mode and advantages of RMC-4550 as an Src-homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP2) inhibitor at molecular level through molecular docking and molecular dynamics,JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS,"The over-activation of Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway associated with a variety of cancers is usually related with abnormal activation of Src-homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP2). For this purpose, SHP2 has attracted extensive interest as a potential target for cancer treatment. RMC-4550, as a newly developed selective inhibitor of SHP2, possesses an overwhelming advantage over the previous generation inhibitor SHP099 in terms of in vitro activity. However, the binding mode of SHP2 with RMC-4550 and the reason for the high efficiency of RMC-4550 as SHP2 inhibitor at molecular level are still unclear. Therefore, in this study, the binding mode of RMC-4550 with SHP2 and the superiorities of RMC-4550 as inhibitor at binding affinity and dynamic interactive behavior with SHP2 were probed by molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. By comparing the results of molecular docking, it was found that SHP2 formed more tight interaction with RMC-4550 than that with SHP099. Subsequently, a series of post-dynamic analyses on three simulation trajectories (SHP2(WT), SHP2(SHP099) and SHP2(RMC-4550)) were performed and found that the SHP2 protein bound with RMC-4550 maintained a firmer interaction between N-Src-homology 2 (N-SH2) and PTP domain throughout the MD simulation, leading to a more stable protein conformation. The finding here provides new clues for the design of SHP2 inhibitor against the over-activation of Ras/MAPK pathway."
Exploring the Pyrazinamide Drug Resistance Mechanism of Clinical Mutants T370P and W403G in Ribosomal Protein S1 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING,"Pyrazinamide (PZA) is an essential first line antitubercular drug, which plays a crucial role in tuberculosis treatment. The PZA, which is considered as a pro-drug needs an enzyme of mycobacterial pyrazinamidase (PZase) for its conversion into an active form pyrazinoic acid. Further, this active form of PZA inhibits the ribosomal proteins Si, which facilitates the transfer-mRNA complex formation throughout the translation. The spontaneous mutations in RpsA have been found to be associated with PZA drug resistance. However, the drug resistance mechanism is still unclear. Furthermore, there is no such information available about the structural dynamics of RpsA protein because of mutations that confer Pyrazinoic acid resistance. Moreover, a total of 18 clinical PZA-resistant isolates were investigated and found to be pncA(WT), which allowed exploration of the resistance mechanism of RpsA in the mutated state. Samples were repeated for the drug susceptibility testing followed by RpsA gene sequencing. A total of 11 clinical isolates harbored a total of 15 mutations. Almost half of the total strains (7/15) were observed to be in the conserved region of RpsA and known as Mycobacterium tuberculosis C-terminal domain. In the current study, (2/7) mutation T370P (mutant 1) and W403G (mutant 2) were explored to ensure the RpsA resistance mechanism through essential dynamics simulation. The essential dynamics study results revealed that the distal loop mutations drastically altered the conformation of RpsA both in the absence () and presence (+) of pyrazinoic acid drug for two reasons: (1) dramatic alteration or reduction in the binding pattern of pyrazinoic acid with active site residues observed and (2) a clear image of the opening and closing switching mechanism was seen upon the distal site mutation on nearby 3(10)-helixes beside the pyrazinoic acid binding site. This switch was found to consistently remain closed only in wild type systems, while it was open in the mutant systems. We called such distance impact an allosteric effect. The overall mechanistic investigations will provide useful information behind drug resistance for better understanding to manage tuberculosis."
An algorithm for finding and adding boundary conditions with the aim of solving the contact problem in computational mechanics,SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY,"Computer simulations based on numerical methods applied to the equilibrium equations of Newtonian mechanics have significant impact in many industries, because they provide cheaper development of products. Using computer simulations, it is possible to investigate behavior of product parts and assemblies under different boundary conditions, loads and applied materials, which significantly reduces the number of real expensive experiments. A large number of simulations can be conducted in order to optimize the geometry, materials, product price, etc. or to confirm that the product satisfies technical and safety requirements. By discretization of equilibrium equations, it is possible to simulate only continuous models, i.e. models whose all parts are physically connected. But a problem that occurs very often is mechanical contact between two or more independent mechanical parts. In case the parts are not physically connected, it is necessary to provide an additional boundary condition using a contact algorithm so that the independent parts would be aware of each other. Because of that, the contact problem between deformable moving bodies is always an interesting topic in computational mechanics and mechanical engineering in general. The problem that initiated the development of the contact algorithm presented in this paper is the possibility of numerical simulation of mechanical tests performed during the development of medical stents with the aim to provide a look inside, to show the state of stress or strain in material of the stent. During the implementation of the contact algorithm, two problems arise: 1. finding contact surfaces between different elastic bodies and 2. preventing the penetration of one body into another body by additional boundary condition. This paper presents the implementation of a contact algorithm by finding boundary surface nodes of a deformable body that have penetrated the boundary surface elements of another deformable bodies, and adding boundary conditions that reverse the penetrated nodes to the body boundary. The algorithm is implemented within the in-house software package for finite element analysis. The software is written in Fortran, which is another challenge, given that Fortran does not have as powerful geometry libraries as other modern programming languages do. The main reason for this was compatibility with existing finite element code and facilitated implementation of future parallelization with the aim of reducing computing time."
Multivariate Recurrent Events in the Presence of Multivariate Informative Censoring with Applications to Bleeding and Transfusion Events in Myelodysplastic Syndrome,JOURNAL OF BIOPHARMACEUTICAL STATISTICS,"We propose a general novel class of joint models to analyze recurrent events that has a wide variety of applications. The focus in this article is to model the bleeding and transfusion events in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) studies, where patients may die or withdraw from the study early due to adverse events or other reasons, such as consent withdrawal or required alternative therapy during the study. The proposed model accommodates multiple recurrent events and multivariate informative censoring through a shared random-effects model. The random-effects model captures both within-subject and within-event dependence simultaneously. We construct the likelihood function for the semiparametric joint model and develop an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for inference. The computational burden does not increase with the number of types of recurrent events. We utilize the MDS clinical trial data to illustrate our proposed methodology. We also conduct a number of simulations to examine the performance of the proposed model."
Why health professions education needs functional linguistics: the power of 'stealth words',MEDICAL EDUCATION,"Context Language is one of the primary modalities for teaching and learning in the health professions in contexts ranging from the more formal teaching relationships of medical school to the guided practice of trainees through continuing education and the deliberate practice of lifelong learning. Yet linguistic analysis, with the possible exception of discourse analysis, has not become a core methodological tool in the field of health professions education (HPE). The purpose of this paper is to argue for the more widespread adoption of one particular approach to linguistics, one that examines less of what learners and instructors say and looks more at how they say it: functional linguistics. Functional linguistics: the power of 'stealth words' This approach theorises and structures the functions of language, regularly focusing attention on 'stealth words' such as I, but and was. Drawing on a rich body of literature in linguistics, psychology, the learning sciences and some early work in HPE, we demonstrate how functional linguistic tools can be applied to better understand learners' and instructors' beliefs, reasoning processes, values and emotions. Functional linguistics and reflection: an application of stealth words A brief qualitative analysis of one tool - analysis of the generic use of 'you' to mean 'one' or 'anyone' - demonstrates how functional linguistics can offer insight into physicians' bids for credibility and alignment as they think aloud about their clinical reasoning. Functional linguistics and hpe: future directions Finally, we offer suggestions for how functional linguistic tools might address questions and gaps in four active research areas in HPE: reflection; emotion and reasoning; learning in simulated contexts, and self-regulated learning. Conclusions We argue that the words used by learners, instructors and practitioners in the health professions as they move through undergraduate and graduate training into practice can offer clues that will help researchers, instructors and colleagues to better support them."
"Synthea: An approach, method, and software mechanism for generating synthetic patients and the synthetic electronic health care record",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,"Our objective is to create a source of synthetic electronic health records that is readily available; suited to industrial, innovation, research, and educational uses; and free of legal, privacy, security, and intellectual property restrictions. We developed Synthea, an open-source software package that simulates the lifespans of synthetic patients, modeling the 10 most frequent reasons for primary care encounters and the 10 chronic conditions with the highest morbidity in the United States. Synthea adheres to a previously developed conceptual framework, scales via open-source deployment on the Internet, and may be extended with additional disease and treatment modules developed by its user community. One million synthetic patient records are now freely available online, encoded in standard formats (eg, Health Level-7 [HL7] Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources [FHIR] and Consolidated-Clinical Document Architecture), and accessible through an HL7 FHIR application program interface. Health care lags other industries in information technology, data exchange, and interoperability. The lack of freely distributable health records has long hindered innovation in health care. Approaches and tools are available to inexpensively generate synthetic health records at scale without accidental disclosure risk, lowering current barriers to entry for promising early-stage developments. By engaging a growing community of users, the synthetic data generated will become increasingly comprehensive, detailed, and realistic over time. Synthetic patients can be simulated with models of disease progression and corresponding standards of care to produce risk-free realistic synthetic health care records at scale."
The use of a virtual patient case in an OSCE-based exam - A pilot study,MEDICAL TEACHER,"Background: This study focuses on a skills test based clinical assessment where 118 fourth-year medical students at the four teaching hospitals of Karolinska Institutet participated in the same 12-module OSCE. The goal of one of the twelve examination modules was to assess the students' skills and ability to solve a virtual patient (VP) case (the ISP system), which included medical history taking, lab tests, physical examinations and suggestion of a preliminary diagnosis. Aims: The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of a VP as a possible tool for assessment of clinical reasoning and problem solving ability among medical students. The feeling of realism of the VP and its possible affective impact on the student's confidence were also investigated. Method: We observed and analysed students' reactions, engagement and performance (activity log files) during their interactive sessions with the simulation. An individual human assistant was provided along with the computer simulation and the videotaped interaction student/assistant was then analysed in detail and related to the students' outcomes. Results: The results indicate possible advantages of using ISP-like systems for assessment. The VP was for instance able to reliably differentiate between students' performances but some weaknesses were also identified, like a confounding influence on students' outcomes by the assistants used. Significant differences, affecting the results, were found between the students in their degree of affective response towards the system as well as the perceived usefulness of assistance. Conclusion: Students need to be trained beforehand in mastering the assessment tool. Rating compliance needs to be targeted before VP-based systems like ISP can be used in exams and if such systems would be used in high-stake exams, the use of human assistants should be limited and scoring rubrics validated (and preferably automated)."
Regression Discontinuity Design Simulation and Application in Two Cardiovascular Trials with Continuous Outcomes,EPIDEMIOLOGY,"In epidemiology, the regression discontinuity design has received increasing attention recently and might be an alternative to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate treatment effects. In regression discontinuity, treatment is assigned above a certain threshold of an assignment variable for which the treatment effect is adjusted in the analysis. We performed simulations and a validation study in which we used treatment effect estimates from an RCT as the reference for a prospectively performed regression discontinuity study. We estimated the treatment effect using linear regression adjusting for the assignment variable both as linear terms and restricted cubic spline and using local linear regression models. In the first validation study, the estimated treatment effect from a cardiovascular RCT was -4.0 mmHg blood pressure (95% confidence interval: -5.4, -2.6) at 2 years after inclusion. The estimated effect in regression discontinuity was -5.9 mmHg (95% confidence interval: -10.8, -1.0) with restricted cubic spline adjustment. Regression discontinuity showed different, local effects when analyzed with local linear regression. In the second RCT, regression discontinuity treatment effect estimates on total cholesterol level at 3 months after inclusion were similar to RCT estimates, but at least six times less precise. In conclusion, regression discontinuity may provide similar estimates of treatment effects to RCT estimates, but requires the assumption of a global treatment effect over the range of the assignment variable. In addition to a risk of bias due to wrong assumptions, researchers need to weigh better recruitment against the substantial loss in precision when considering a study with regression discontinuity versus RCT design."
The performance of inverse probability of treatment weighting and full matching on the propensity score in the presence of model misspecification when estimating the effect of treatment on survival outcomes,STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH,"There is increasing interest in estimating the causal effects of treatments using observational data. Propensity-score matching methods are frequently used to adjust for differences in observed characteristics between treated and control individuals in observational studies. Survival or time-to-event outcomes occur frequently in the medical literature, but the use of propensity score methods in survival analysis has not been thoroughly investigated. This paper compares two approaches for estimating the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) on survival outcomes: Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) and full matching. The performance of these methods was compared in an extensive set of simulations that varied the extent of confounding and the amount of misspecification of the propensity score model. We found that both IPTW and full matching resulted in estimation of marginal hazard ratios with negligible bias when the ATE was the target estimand and the treatment-selection process was weak to moderate. However, when the treatment-selection process was strong, both methods resulted in biased estimation of the true marginal hazard ratio, even when the propensity score model was correctly specified. When the propensity score model was correctly specified, bias tended to be lower for full matching than for IPTW. The reasons for these biases and for the differences between the two methods appeared to be due to some extreme weights generated for each method. Both methods tended to produce more extreme weights as the magnitude of the effects of covariates on treatment selection increased. Furthermore, more extreme weights were observed for IPTW than for full matching. However, the poorer performance of both methods in the presence of a strong treatment-selection process was mitigated by the use of IPTW with restriction and full matching with a caliper restriction when the propensity score model was correctly specified."
Targeted estimation of heterogeneous treatment effect in observational survival analysis,JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS,"The aim of clinical effectiveness research using repositories of electronic health records is to identify what health interventions 'work best' in real-world settings. Since there are several reasons why the net benefit of intervention may differ across patients, current comparative effectiveness literature focuses on investigating heterogeneous treatment effect and predicting whether an individual might benefit from an intervention. The on majority of this literature has concentrated on the estimation of the effect of treatment on binary outcomes. However, many medical interventions are evaluated in terms of their effect on future events, which are subject to loss to follow-up. In this study, we describe a framework for the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effect in terms of differences in time-to-event (survival) probabilities. We divide the problem into three phases: (1) estimation of treatment effect conditioned on unique sets of the covariate vector; (2) identification of features important for heterogeneity using non-parametric variable importance methods; and (3) estimation of treatment effect on the reference classes defined by the previously selected features, using one-step Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation. We conducted a series of simulation studies and found that this method performs well when either sample size or event rate is high enough and the number of covariates contributing to the effect heterogeneity is moderate. An application of this method to a clinical case study was conducted by estimating the effect of oral anticoagulants on newly diagnosed non-valvular atrial fibrillation patients using data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink."
Beliefs and values about intra-operative teaching and learning: a case study of surgical teachers and trainees,ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION,"Surgeons require advanced psychomotor skills, critical decision-making and teamwork skills. Much of surgical skills training involve progressive trainee participation in supervised operations where case variability, operating team interaction and environment affect learning, while surgical teachers face the key challenge of ensuring patient safety. Using a theoretical framework of situated learning including cognitive apprenticeship, we explored teachers' and trainees' beliefs and values about intra-operative training and reasons for any differences. A qualitative case study method was used where five teacher-trainee pairs participating in an observed teaching operation were separately interviewed about the same operation. Thematic analysis of transcribed interviews and observations was performed with iterative refinement and a reflexive approach was adopted throughout the study. We found that in all cases, teachers and trainees had shared recognition of learning about technical skills whereas they differed in three cases regarding non-technical skills such as surgical reasoning and team management. Factors contributing to teacher and trainee satisfaction with the process were successful trainee completion of operation without need for surgeon take-over, a positive learning environment and learning new things. Teaching-learning behaviours observed and discussed were modeling, coaching and scaffolding, while exploration, reflection and articulation were less common. Our study reveals differing teacher and trainee perspectives of some aspects of intra-operative training and surfaces new reasons other than amount of feedback and autonomy given. Factors contributing to different perspectives include teacher and trainee abilities, values and situational influences. Targeted teaching-learning strategies could enhance intra-operative learning."
A Simulation Model of Neural Activity During Hand Reaching Movement,BASIC AND CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE,"Introduction: The neural response is a noisy random process. The neural response to a sensory stimulus is completely equivalent to a list of spike times in the spike train. In previous studies, decreased neuronal response variability was observed in the cortex's various areas during motor preparatory in reaching tasks. The reasons for the reduction in Neural Variability (NV) are unclear. It could be influenced by an increased firing rate, or it could result from the intrinsic characteristic of cells during the Reaction Time (RT). Methods: A neural response function with an underlying deterministic instantaneous firing rate signal and a random Poisson process spike generator was simulated in this research. Neural stimulation could help us understand the relationships between the complex data structures of cortical activities and their stability in detail during motor intention in arm-reaching tasks. Results: Our measurements indicated a similar pattern of results to the cortex, a sharp reduction of the normalized variance of simulated spike trains across all trials. We also observed a reverse relationship between activity and normalized variance. Conclusion: The present study findings could be applied to neural engineering and brain-machine interfaces for controlling external devices, like the movement of a robot arm."
Smoothing Corrections for Improving Sample Size Recalculation Rules in Adaptive Group Sequential Study Designs,METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE,"Background An adequate sample size calculation is essential for designing a successful clinical trial. One way to tackle planning difficulties regarding parameter assumptions required for sample size calculation is to adapt the sample size during the ongoing trial. This can be attained by adaptive group sequential study designs. At a predefined timepoint, the interim effect is tested for significance. Based on the interim test result, the trial is either stopped or continued with the possibility of a sample size recalculation. Objectives Sample size recalculation rules have different limitations in application like a high variability of the recalculated sample size. Hence, the goal is to provide a tool to counteract this performance limitation. Methods Sample size recalculation rules can be interpreted as functions of the observed interim effect. Often, a jump from the first stage's sample size to the maximal sample size at a rather arbitrarily chosen interim effect size is implemented and the curve decreases monotonically afterwards. This jump is one reason for a high variability of the sample size. In this work, we investigate how the shape of the recalculation function can be improved by implementing a smoother increase of the sample size. The design options are evaluated by means of Monte Carlo simulations. Evaluation criteria are univariate performance measures such as the conditional power and sample size as well as a conditional performance score which combines these components. Results We demonstrate that smoothing corrections can reduce variability in conditional power and sample size as well as they increase the performance with respect to a recently published conditional performance score for medium and large standardized effect sizes. Conclusion Based on the simulation study, we present a tool that is easily implemented to improve sample size recalculation rules. The approach can be combined with existing sample size recalculation rules described in the literature."
Computational Approaches in Preclinical Studies on Drug Discovery and Development,FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY,"Because undesirable pharmacokinetics and toxicity are significant reasons for the failure of drug development in the costly late stage, it has been widely recognized that drug ADMET properties should be considered as early as possible to reduce failure rates in the clinical phase of drug discovery. Concurrently, drug recalls have become increasingly common in recent years, prompting pharmaceutical companies to increase attention toward the safety evaluation of preclinical drugs.In vitroandin vivodrug evaluation techniques are currently more mature in preclinical applications, but these technologies are costly. In recent years, with the rapid development of computer science,in silicotechnology has been widely used to evaluate the relevant properties of drugs in the preclinical stage and has produced many software programs andin silicomodels, further promoting the study of ADMETin vitro. In this review, we first introduce the two ADMET prediction categories (molecular modeling and data modeling). Then, we perform a systematic classification and description of the databases and software commonly used for ADMET prediction. We focus on some widely studied ADMT properties as well as PBPK simulation, and we list some applications that are related to the prediction categories and web tools. Finally, we discuss challenges and limitations in the preclinical area and propose some suggestions and prospects for the future."
Simulation of superselective catheterization for cerebrovascular lesions using a virtual injection software,CVIR ENDOVASCULAR,"Background This report addresses the feasibility of virtual injection software based on contrast-enhanced cone-beam CTs (CBCTs) in the context of cerebrovascular lesion embolization. Intracranial arteriovenous malformation (AVM), dural arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and mycotic aneurysm embolization cases with CBCTs performed between 2013 and 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Cerebrovascular lesions were reviewed by 2 neurointerventionalists using a dedicated virtual injection software (EmboASSIST, GE Healthcare; Chicago, IL). Points of Interest (POIs) surrounding the vascular lesions were first identified. The software then automatically displayed POI-associated vascular traces from vessel roots to selected POIs. Vascular segments and reason for POI identification were recorded. Using 2D multiplanar reconstructions from CBCTs, the accuracy of vascular traces was assessed. Clinical utility metrics were recorded on a 3-point Likert scale from 1 (no benefit) to 3 (very beneficial). Results Nine cases (7 AVM, 1 AVF, 1 mycotic aneurysm) were reviewed, with 26 POIs selected. Three POIs were in 2nd order segments, 8 POIs in 3rd order segments and 15 POIs in 4th order segments of their respective arteries. The reviewers rated all 26 POI traces - involving a total of 90 vascular segments - as accurate. The average utility score across the 8 questions were 2.7 and 2.8 respectively from each reviewer, acknowledging the software's potential benefit in cerebrovascular embolization procedural planning. Conclusion The operators considered CBCT-based virtual injection software clinically useful and accurate in guiding and planning cerebrovascular lesion embolization in this retrospective review. Future prospective studies in larger cohorts are warranted for validation of this modality."
Vacuum mattress or long spine board: which method of spinal stabilisation in trauma patients is more time consuming? A simulation study,SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE,"Background Spinal stabilisation is recommended for prehospital trauma treatment. In Germany, vacuum mattresses are traditionally used for spinal stabilisation, whereas in anglo-american countries, long spine boards are preferred. While it is recommended that the on-scene time is as short as possible, even less than 10 minutes for unstable patients, spinal stabilisation is a time-consuming procedure. For this reason, the time needed for spinal stabilisation may prevent the on-scene time from being brief. The aim of this simulation study was to compare the time required for spinal stabilisation between a scoop stretcher in conjunction with a vacuum mattress and a long spine board. Methods Medical personnel of different professions were asked to perform spinal immobilizations with both methods. A total of 172 volunteers were immobilized under ideal conditions as well as under realistic conditions. A vacuum mattress was used for 78 spinal stabilisations, and a long spinal board was used for 94. The duration of the procedures were measured by video analysis. Results Under ideal conditions, spinal stabilisation on a vacuum mattress and a spine board required 254.4 s (95 % CI 235.6-273.2 s) and 83.4 s (95 % CI 77.5-89.3 s), respectively (p < 0.01). Under realistic conditions, the vacuum mattress and spine board required 358.3 s (95 % CI 316.0-400.6 s) and 112.6 s (95 % CI 102.6-122.6 s), respectively (p < 0.01). Conclusions Spinal stabilisation for trauma patients is significantly more time consuming on a vacuum mattress than on a long spine board. Considering that the prehospital time of EMS should not exceed 60 minutes and the on-scene time should not exceed 30 minutes or even 10 minutes if the patient is in extremis, based on our results, spinal stabilisation on a vacuum mattress may consume more than 20 % of the recommended on-scene time. In contrast, stabilisation on a spine board requires only one third of the time required for that on a vacuum mattress. We conclude that a long spine board may be feasible for spinal stabilisation for critical trauma patients with timesensitive life threatening ABCDE-problems to ensure the shortest possible on-scene time for prehospital trauma treatment, not least if a patient has to be rescued from an open or inaccessible terrain, especially that with uneven overgrown land."
Script Concordance Testing: Assessing Residents' Clinical Decision-Making Skills for Infant Lumbar Punctures,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,"Purpose Residents must learn which infants require a lumbar puncture (LP), a clinical decision-making skill (CDMS) difficult to evaluate because of considerable practice variation. The authors created an assessment model of the CDMS to determine when an LP is indicated, taking practice variation into account. The objective was to detect whether script concordance testing (SCT) could measure CDMS competency among residents for performing infant LPs. Method In 2011, using a modified Delphi technique, an expert panel of 14 attending physicians constructed 15 case vignettes (each with 2 to 4 SCT questions) that represented various infant LP scenarios. The authors distributed the vignettes to residents at 10 academic pediatric centers within the International Simulation in Pediatric Innovation, Research, and Education Network. They compared SCT scores among residents of different postgraduate years (PGYs), specialties, training in adult medicine, LP experience, and practice within an endemic Lyme disease area. Results Of 730 eligible residents, 102 completed 47 SCT questions. They could earn a maximum score of 47. Median SCT scores were significantly higher in PGY-3s compared with PGY-1s (difference: 3.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-4.9; effect size d = 0.87). Scores also increased with increasing LP experience (difference: 3.3; 95% CI 1.1-5.5) and with adult medicine training (difference: 2.9; 95% CI 0.6-5.0). Residents in Lyme-endemic areas tended to perform more LPs than those in nonendemic areas. Conclusions SCT questions may be useful as an assessment tool to determine CDMS competency among residents for performing infant LPs."
Investigation of the Binding Site of CCR2 using 4-Azetidinyl-1-aryl-cyclohexane Derivatives: A Membrane Modeling and Molecular Dynamics Study,BULLETIN OF THE KOREAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY,"Chemokine receptor (CCR2) is a G protein-coupled receptor that contains seven transmembrane helices. Recent pharmaceutical research has focused on the antagonism of CCR2 and candidate drugs are currently undergoing clinical studies for the treatment of diseases like arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and type 2 diabetes. In this study, we analyzed the time dependent behavior of CCR2 docked with a potent 4-azetidinyl-1-aryl-cyclohexane (4AAC) derivative using molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) for 20 nanoseconds (ns). Homology modeling of CCR2 was performed and the 4AAC derivative was docked into this binding site. The docked model of selected conformations was then utilized to study the dynamic behavior of the 4AAC enzyme complexes inside lipid membrane. MDS of CCR2-16b of 4AAC complexes allowed us to refine the system since binding of an inhibitor to a receptor is a dynamic process and identify stable structures and better binding modes. Structure activity relationships (SAR) for 4AAC derivatives were investigated and reasons for the activities were determined. Probable binding pose for some CCR2 antagonists were determined from the perspectives of binding site. Initial modeling showed that Tyr49, Trp98, Ser101, Glu291, and additional residues are crucial for 4AAC binding, but MDS analysis showed that Ser101 may not be vital. 4AAC moved away from Ser101 and the hydrogen bonding between 4AAC and Ser101 vanished. The results of this study provide useful information regarding the structure-based drug design of CCR2 antagonists and additionally suggest key residues for further study by mutagenesis."
AIDA (2) - A MK-II AUTOMATED INSULIN DOSAGE ADVISER,JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,"A prototype computer system has been developed to provide advice on the day-to-day adjustment of insulin dosage in the insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetic patient. The system also allows the patient's daily steady-state blood glucose profile to be generated based on these adjustments using a clinical model of glucose-insulin interaction. The prototype is intended to be used as a decision support system by clinical personnel It is designed for use during consultations, as a simulator of patient response following changes in the insulin and/or dietary regimen, and as a system to provide education on planning insulin therapy. Advice is generated by a qualitative therapeutic advisor which suggests what the next step in improving glycaemic control might be for a given patient. The clinical model attempts to reflect the underlying (patho)physiology of insulin action and carbohydrate absorption in quantitative terms. It consists of a one-compartment glucose model linked to a model with plasma and 'active' insulin compartments. An overview of the integrated prototype is provided along with a detailed description of the new time-point-orientated logical reasoning methodology adopted by the therapeutic advisor. The operation of the system is illustrated by a clinical case study from a 70 kg, male, insulin-dependent diabetic patient."
The spatial resolution in dosimetry with normoxic polymer-gels investigated with the dose modulation transfer approach,MEDICAL PHYSICS,"The verification of dose distributions with high dose gradients as appearing in brachytherapy or stereotactic radiotherapy for example, calls for dosimetric methods with sufficiently high spatial resolution. Polymer gels in combination with a MR or optical scanner as a readout device have the potential of performing the verification of a three-dimensional dose distribution within a single measurement. The purpose of this work is to investigate the spatial resolution achievable in MR-based polymer gel dosimetry. The authors show that dosimetry on a very small spatial scale (voxel size: 94x94x1000 mu m(3)) can be performed with normoxic polymer gels using parameter selective T2 imaging. In order to prove the spatial resolution obtained we are relying on the dose-modulation transfer function (DMTF) concept based on very fine dose modulations at half periods of 200 mu m. Very fine periodic dose modulations of a Co-60 photon field were achieved by means of an absorption grid made of tungsten-carbide, specifically designed for quality control. The dose modulation in the polymer gel is compared with that of film dosimetry in one plane via the DMTF concept for general access to the spatial resolution of a dose imaging system. Additionally Monte Carlo simulations were performed and used for the calculation of the DMTF of both, the polymer gel and film dosimetry. The results obtained by film dosimetry agree well with those of Monte Carlo simulations, whereas polymer gel dosimetry overestimates the amplitude value of the fine dose modulations. The authors discuss possible reasons. The in-plane resolution achieved in this work competes with the spatial resolution of standard clinical film-scanner systems.

The importance of being external. methodological insights for the external validation of machine learning models in medicine,COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE,"Background and Objective Medical machine learning (ML) models tend to perform better on data from the same cohort than on new data, often due to overfitting, or co-variate shifts. For these reasons, external validation (EV) is a necessary practice in the evaluation of medical ML. However, there is still a gap in the literature on how to interpret EV results and hence assess the robustness of ML models. Methods: We fill this gap by proposing a meta-validation method, to assess the soundness of EV procedures. In doing so, we complement the usual way to assess EV by considering both dataset cardinality, and the similarity of the EV dataset with respect to the training set. We then investigate how the notions of cardinality and similarity can be used to inform on the reliability of a validation procedure, by integrating them into two summative data visualizations. Results: We illustrate our methodology by applying it to the validation of a state-of-the-art COVID-19 diagnostic model on 8 EV sets, collected across 3 different continents. The model performance was moderately impacted by data similarity (Pearson rho = 0.38, p < 0.001). In the EV, the validated model reported good AUC (average: 0.84), acceptable calibration (average: 0.17) and utility (average: 0.50). The validation datasets were adequate in terms of dataset cardinality and similarity, thus suggesting the soundness of the results. We also provide a qualitative guideline to evaluate the reliability of validation procedures, and we discuss the importance of proper external validation in light of the obtained results. Conclusions: In this paper, we propose a novel, lean methodology to: 1) study how the similarity between training and validation sets impacts the generalizability of a ML model; 2) assess the soundness of EV evaluations along three complementary performance dimensions: discrimination, utility and calibration; 3) draw conclusions on the robustness of the model under validation. We applied this methodology to a state-of-the-art model for the diagnosis of COVID-19 from routine blood tests, and showed how to interpret the results in light of the presented framework.

Thermal damage prediction for collagenous tissues part I: A clinically relevant numerical simulation incorporating heating rate dependent denaturation,JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME,"Subablative thermotherapy is frequently used for the treatment of joint instability related diseases. In this therapy, mechanically deformed collagenous tissues are thermally shrunk and the stability of the tissue is re-established. In this research, the thermal damage fields generated by three different clinical heating modalities (monopolar and bipolar radio frequency and Ho:YAG laser) are compared numerically using finite element analysis. The heating rate dependent denaturation characteristics of collagenous tissues are incorporated into the model using experimental data from in vitro experimentation with rabbit patellar tendons. It is shown that there are significant differences among the thermal damage profiles created by these modalities, explaining the main reason for the discrepancies reported in the literature in terms of the efficacy and safety of each modality. In the complementary paper the accuracy of the model presented here is verified by in vitro experimentation with a model collagenous tissue and by quantifying the denaturation-induced birefringence change using Optical Coherence Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging."
Nontechnical skill training and the use of scenarios in modern surgical education,CURRENT OPINION IN UROLOGY,"Purpose of review Nontechnical skills are being increasingly recognized as a core reason of surgical errors. Combined with the changing nature of surgical training, there has therefore been an increase in nontechnical skill research in the literature. This review therefore aims to: define nontechnical skillsets, assess current training methods, explore assessment modalities and suggest future research aims. Recent findings The literature demonstrates an increasing understanding of the components of nontechnical skills within surgery. This has led to a greater availability of validated training methods for its training, including the use of didactic teaching, e-learning and simulation-based scenarios. In addition, there are now various extensively validated assessment tools for nontechnical skills including NOTSS, the Oxford NOTECHS and OTAS. Finally, there is now more focus on the development of tools which target individual nontechnical skill components and an attempt to understand which of these play a greater role in specific procedures such as laparoscopic or robotic surgery. Summary Current evidence demonstrates various training methods and tools for the training of nontechnical skills. Future research is likely to focus increasingly on individual nontechnical skill components and procedurespecific skills."
Current status and future perspective of flattening filter free photon beams,MEDICAL PHYSICS,"Purpose: Flattening filters (FFs) have been considered as an integral part of the treatment head of a medical accelerator for more than 50 years. The reasons for the longstanding use are, however, historical ones. Advanced treatment techniques, such as stereotactic radiotherapy or intensity modulated radiotherapy have stimulated the interest in operating linear accelerators in a flattening filter free (FFF) mode. The current manuscript reviews treatment head physics of FFF beams, describes their characteristics and the resulting potential advantages in their medical use, and closes with an outlook. Methods: A number of dosimetric benefits have been determined for FFF beams, which range from increased dose rate and dose per pulse to favorable output ratio in-air variation with field size, reduced energy variation across the beam, and reduced leakage and out-of-field dose, respectively. Finally, the softer photon spectrum of unflattened beams has implications on imaging strategies and radiation protection. Results: The dosimetric characteristics of FFF beams have an effect on treatment delivery, patient comfort, dose calculation accuracy, beam matching, absorbed dose determination, treatment planning, machine specific quality assurance, imaging, and radiation protection. When considering conventional C-arm linacs in a FFF mode, more studies are needed to specify and quantify the clinical advantages, especially with respect to treatment plan quality and quality assurance. Conclusions: New treatment units are already on the market that operate without a FF or can be operated in a dedicated clinical FFF mode. Due to the convincing arguments of removing the FF, it is expected that more vendors will offer dedicated treatment units for advanced photon beam therapy in the near future. Several aspects related to standardization, dosimetry, treatment planning, and optimization need to be addressed in more detail in order to facilitate the clinical implementation of unflattened beams.

Variations in the SDN Loop of Class A Beta-Lactamases: A Study of the Molecular Mechanism of BlaC (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) to Alter the Stability and Catalytic Activity Towards Antibiotic Resistance of MBIs,FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,"The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis calls for an immediate search for novel treatment strategies. Recently, BlaC, the principal beta-lactamase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, was recognized as a potential therapeutic target. BlaC belongs to Ambler class A, which is generally susceptible to the beta-lactamase inhibitors currently used in clinics: tazobactam, sulbactam, and clavulanate. Alterations at Ser130 in conserved SDN loop confer resistance to mechanism-based inhibitors (MBIs) commonly observed in various clinical isolates. The absence of clinical evidence of S130G conversion in M. tuberculosis draws our attention to build laboratory mutants of S130G and S130A of BlaC. The study involving steady state, inhibition kinetics, and fluorescence microscopy shows the emergence of resistance against MBIs to the mutants expressing S130G and S130A. To understand the molecular reasoning behind the unavailability of such mutation in real life, we have used circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and stability-based enzyme activity to compare the stability and dynamic behaviors of native and S130G/A mutant form of BlaC. A significant decrease in melting temperature (BlaC T-M 60 degrees C, S130A T-M 50 degrees C, and S130G T-M 45 degrees C), kinetic instability at higher temperature, and comparative dynamic instability correlate the fact that resistance to beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations will likely not arise from the structural alteration of BlaC, therefore establishing confidence that this therapeutic modality can be potentially applied as a part of a successful treatment regimen against M. tuberculosis.</p>"
Optimization of Repeat Computed Tomography Simulation for a More Efficient Workflow in the Radiation Therapy Unit: A Single-Institution Experience,BIOSCIENCE BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS,"The purpose of this study was to identify factors that increase efficiency, reduce performance rates, decrease overall patient waiting time, and maximize the degree of patient access associated with repeated computed tomography at the Radiation Oncology Unit of King Abdulaziz University Hospital. We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients who underwent repeated computed tomography at the Radiation Therapy Unit of King Abdulaziz University Hospital from January 2014 to December 2018. Re-scanning was required for communication-related, clinical, patient-related, and technical issues. The characteristics of the study variables were defined using simple descriptive statistics. A chi-squared test was used to establish relationships between categorical variables. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.During the study period, 241 cases were referred for re-scanning. The rate of re-scanning almost doubled from 2014 (3.2%) to 2018 (5.7%). Clinical issues were the most common reasons for re-scanning (102 cases), followed by patient-related (89 cases), communication-related (45 cases), and technical issues (3 cases). The chi-squared test revealed significant associations among the variables (p-value=0.002, <0.001, and <0.001 for communication, clinical, and patientrelated issues, respectively). We observed an increasing trend in the overall frequency of re-scanning. The number of re-scanning procedures due to clinical and communication-related issues decreased significantly in 2018, while those owing to patient-related issues increased significantly. Frequent planned evaluation of the workflow and identification of potential reversible and recurring issues responsible for decreased scanning efficiency will be beneficial in radiation oncology. Resolving such issues can improve the safety and quality of patient care.."
Correlation between nasal airflow characteristics and clinical relevance of nasal septal deviation to nasal airway obstruction,RESPIRATORY PHYSIOLOGY & NEUROBIOLOGY,"Since the imbalance of the nasal cavities due to nasal septal deviation (NSD) is a commonly observed anatomic variation in healthy adults, clinicians must often decide whether or not it is clinically relevant to the symptoms of nasal airway obstruction (NAO). Main reason for this is a lack of data correlating the symptoms of NAO with objective findings. The aim of our study is to find the correlation between fluid dynamic parameters and the anatomy of nasal cavity with NSD by numerical simulation. We generated 6 computational models of nasal cavities with NSD were created from computed tomographic images: 3 symptomatic patients with NAO and 3 asymptomatic patients. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to simulate steady inspiratory airflows in each nasal cavity model and compare the fluid dynamic properties of each. In the symptomatic cases, the pressure drop from the naris to the end of the septum was larger, and more uneven flow partitioning was observed. Local maximum velocity and wall shear stress were higher in the symptomatic group than in the asymptomatic group. The symptoms of NAO seem to be related more to the nasal resistance from the naris to the end of the septum than to the total nasal resistance from naris to nasopharynx. Factors correlated with NAO by CFD can be used as elements in patient-specific objective diagnostic tools for NAO in the presence of NSD. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Different Effects of Species-dependent Funny Channel Current on Engineered Biological Pacemaking Activity,2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOINFORMATICS AND BIOMEDICINE (BIBM),"It has been verified that biological pacemaker could be produced based on ventricular myocytes ( VMs) by overexpressing HCN gene which codes the expression of hyperpolarization-activated current (I-f). Clinically, xenograft is in common use by which one specie' stem cell is infected with another specie's HCN gene so that the stem cell could transfer into cardiac pacemaker cell. The difference of HCN gene between species affects I-f properties, but how the If properties influence pacemaker creation is not easy to be qualified in biological experiments. In this study, we build an engineered biological pacemaker model based on a ventricular myocyte model by incorporating I-f formulation and simulated the membrane potential of biological pacemaker. The I-f of different species is simulated by modifying average half-maximal activation voltage (V-1/2) of I-f activation gate and I-f conductance (G(f)). Based on the modified pacemaker model, the effect of I-f properties on pacemaking stability and frequency is evaluated. Simulation results indicate that pacemaking ability is influenced dramatically by I-f properties. In addition, the spontaneous pacemaking mechanism showed both membrane-clock and Ca2+-clock and its deep reason is analyzed in this paper. This study may provide a subcellular perspective for the clinical use of biological pacemaker."
Perceptions and experience of veterinary surgery residents with minimally invasive surgery simulation training,VETERINARY SURGERY,"Objective To determine access to and use of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) simulators among American College of Veterinary Surgeons (ACVS) small animal residents and to identify barriers to simulator use and perceptions of simulator training. Study design Voluntary online survey. Sample population One hundred forty-one ACVS small animal residents. Methods American College of Veterinary Surgeons residents were identified by contacting ACVS residency program directors. An emailed online survey was sent to residents along with a reminder email 2 weeks later. All surveys were collected within 1 month. Participation was voluntary but incentivized. Results Response rate to the survey was 79 of 141 (56%) residents. Twenty-eight of 77 (36%) residents have access to a simulator, with box simulators being most common. Lack of time was the most frequent reason for not using the simulator more. Sixty-eight of 77 (88%) and 65 of 77 (65%) residents agreed or strongly agreed that simulator-based training improves laparoscopic skills and that simulator skills are transferable to the operating room, respectively. Residents with access to a simulator were more comfortable with basic laparoscopic surgeries at the end of their residency than those without such access (P = .04). Conclusion There is substantial room for improved access to and use of MIS simulator training in ACVS residency programs. Despite lack of simulator access, residents believed that simulator training improved their skill and comfort level with basic laparoscopic procedures. Clinical significance The results of this study inform us about access to and perceptions of MIS simulator training among residents. This information is important to surgeons responsible for training residents and may help guide the creation of a surgical skills curriculum."
"Time-efficient, goal-directed, and evidence-based teaching in the ICU",CURRENT OPINION IN ANESTHESIOLOGY,"Purpose of review Teaching in the stressful, high-acuity environment of the ICU is challenging. The intensivist-educator must use teaching strategies that are both effective and time-efficient, as well as evidence-based approaches to the ICU curriculum. This review provides an overview of pertinent educational theories and their implications on educational practices, a selection of effective teaching techniques, and a review on feedback. Recent findings Evidence supports the role of conceptual frameworks in providing the educator with a key perspective to obtain a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to an effective and goal-directed education in the ICU. The role of simulation training for technical and nontechnical skills acquisition is growing. Feedback is difficult to provide, but critical to facilitate learner success; frameworks, and approaches are becoming more standardized. Summary Direct teaching should be goal-oriented, sequential, and adjusted to the level of the learner. The ICU curriculum should optimize cognitive load, reduce stress that is unrelated to the activity, include resilience training, and help trainees deal with stressful clinical situations better. Simulation is a powerful tool to promote technical and nontechnical skills. Providing feedback is essential and a skill that can be taught and enhanced with structure, prompts, and tools."
Comprehensive structure-function analysis of causative variants in retinal pigment epithelium specific 65 kDa protein associated Leber Congenital Amaurosis,NON-CODING RNA RESEARCH,"A recent study published to screen RPE65 in 187 families with Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) by Zilin Zhong in 2019. There are seven novel variants were identified in RPE65, which was associated with LCA, but among only five were missense mutations [(c.124C > T, p.(Leu42Phe), c.149T > C, p. (Phe50Ser), c.340A > C, p. (Asn114His), c.425A > G, p.(Asp142Gly) and c.1399C > G, p.(Pro467Ala)] in the Chinese population and potentially facilitates its clinical implementation. Further in-continuation of this study to the target of five novel missense mutations were the analysis of both structural and functional impact by the molecular dynamics and simulation. The result of five missense mutations might in critical structural alterations of RPE65 protein, disrupt its membrane association or rescue the activity of enzyme due to thermodynamics stability, and for this reason impair its isomerohydrolase activity, resulting in retinal dystrophy. These observations suggest that the reduced protein stability and altered subcellular localization of RPE65 might signify a mechanism for these mutations to lead to vision loss in LCA patients."
The roles of deliberate practice and innate ability in developing expertise: evidence and implications,MEDICAL EDUCATION,"CONTEXT Medical education research focuses extensively on experience and deliberate practice (DP) as key factors in the development of expert performance. The research on DP minimises the role of individual ability in expert performance. This claim ignores a large body of research supporting the importance of innate individual cognitive differences. We review the relationship between DP and an innate individual ability, working memory (WM) capacity, to illustrate how both DP and individual ability predict expert performance. METHODS This narrative review examines the relationship between DP and WM in accounting for expert performance. Studies examining DP, WM and individual differences were identified through a targeted search. RESULTS Although all studies support extensive DP as a factor in explaining expertise, much research suggests individual cognitive differences, such as WM capacity, predict expert performance after controlling for DP. The extent to which this occurs may be influenced by the nature of the task under study and the cognitive processes used by experts. The importance of WM capacity is greater for tasks that are non-routine or functionally complex. Clinical reasoning displays evidence of this task-dependent importance of individual ability. CONCLUSIONS No single factor is both necessary and sufficient in explaining expertise, and individual abilities such as WM can be important. These individual abilities are likely to contribute to expert performance in clinical settings. Medical education research and practice should identify the individual differences in novices and experts that are important to clinical performance."
A direction-selective flattening filter for clinical photon beams. Monte Carlo evaluation of a new concept,PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,"A new concept for the design of flattening filters applied in the generation of 6 and 15 MV photon beams by clinical linear accelerators is evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation. The beam head of the Siemens Primus accelerator has been taken as the starting point for the study of the conceived beam head modifications. The direction-selective filter (DSF) system developed in this work is midway between the classical flattening filter (FF) by which homogeneous transversal dose profiles have been established, and the flattening filter-free (FFF) design, by which advantages such as increased dose rate and reduced production of leakage photons and photoneutrons per Gy in the irradiated region have been achieved, whereas dose profile flatness was abandoned. The DSF concept is based on the selective attenuation of bremsstrahlung photons depending on their direction of emission from the bremsstrahlung target, accomplished by means of newly designed small conical filters arranged close to the target. This results in the capture of large-angle scattered Compton photons from the filter in the primary collimator. Beam flatness has been obtained up to any field cross section which does not exceed a circle of 15 cm diameter at 100 cm focal distance, such as 10 x 10 cm(2), 4 x 14.5 cm(2) or less. This flatness offers simplicity of dosimetric verifications, online controls and plausibility estimates of the dose to the target volume. The concept can be utilized when the application of small-and medium-sized homogeneous fields is sufficient, e.g. in the treatment of prostate, brain, salivary gland, larynx and pharynx as well as pediatric tumors and for cranial or extracranial stereotactic treatments. Significant dose rate enhancement has been achieved compared with the FF system, with enhancement factors 1.67 (DSF) and 2.08 (FFF) for 6 MV, and 2.54 (DSF) and 3.96 (FFF) for 15 MV. Shortening the delivery time per fraction matters with regard to workflow in a radiotherapy department, patient comfort, reduction of errors due to patient movement and a slight, probably just noticable improvement of the treatment outcome due to radiobiological reasons. In comparison with the FF system, the number of head leakage photons per Gy in the irradiated region has been reduced at 15 MV by factors 1/2.54 (DSF) and 1/3.96 (FFF), and the source strength of photoneutrons was reduced by factors 1/2.81 (DSF) and 1/3.49 (FFF)."
Estimation of a decreasing hazard of patients with acute coronary syndrome,STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,"The KaplanMeier, NelsonAalen and Breslow estimators are widely used in the analysis of right-censored time to event data in medical applications. These methods are fully non-parametric and do not put any restriction on the shape of the hazard curve. In some applications, this leads to implausible estimates of the hazard course over time. With non-parametric shape-constrained estimation techniques, one can facilitate an increasing or decreasing hazard and thus generate estimators that better match the biological reasoning, without being as restrictive as parametric methods. We illustrate the advantage of such techniques in the analysis of a large clinical trial in cardiology. Simulation results show that in case the true hazard is monotone, the non-parametric shape-constrained estimators are more accurate than the traditional estimators on the hazard level. On the (cumulative) distribution function level, the shape-constrained estimators show similar performance as the traditional ones. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
Validated Computational Model to Compute Re-apposition Pressures for Treating Type-B Aortic Dissections,FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY,"The use of endovascular treatment in the thoracic aorta has revolutionized the clinical approach for treating Stanford type B aortic dissection. The endograft procedure is a minimally invasive alternative to traditional surgery for the management of complicated type-B patients. The endograft is first deployed to exclude the proximal entry tear to redirect blood flow toward the true lumen and then a stent graft is used to push the intimal flap against the false lumen (FL) wall such that the aorta is reconstituted by sealing the FL. Although endovascular treatment has reduced the mortality rate in patients compared to those undergoing surgical repair, more than 30% of patients who were initially successfully treated require a new endovascular or surgical intervention in the aortic segments distal to the endograft. One reason for failure of the repair is persistent FL perfusion from distal entry tears. This creates a patent FL channel which can be associated with FL growth. Thus, it is necessary to develop stents that can promote full re-apposition of the flap leading to complete closure of the FL. In the current study, we determine the radial pressures required to re-appose the mid and distal ends of a dissected porcine thoracic aorta using a balloon catheter under static inflation pressure. The same analysis is simulated using finite element analysis (FEA) models by incorporating the hyperelastic properties of porcine aortic tissues. It is shown that the FEA models capture the change in the radial pressures required to re-appose the intimal flap as a function of pressure. The predictions from the simulation models match closely the results from the bench experiments. The use of validated computational models can support development of better stents by calculating the proper radial pressures required for complete re-apposition of the intimal flap."
Fuzzy Decision of Drug Dosage for Type-1 Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infected Patients,PROCEEDINGS OF 2018 5TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CLOUD COMPUTING AND INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS (CCIS),"The research subject of fuzzy decision of drug dosage for type-1 human immunodeficiency virus(HIV-1) infected patients is discussed by the aid of a existing fuzzy dynamic HIV-1 model. Firstly, by making use of the previous fuzzy modeling method, that intractable nonlinear predator-prey like model is converted to a set of tractable linear sub-models. Then, based on the above tractable sub-models and a kind of sampled-data fuzzy control strategy with a set of decay factors, all the dynamic properties of the fuzzy dynamic HIV-1 model can be acquired by means of high-performance computer simulations. Thirdly, some fuzzy decisions of drug dosage for HIV-1 infected patients are reasoned by consulting the computer simulation results and thus a bank of instructional advices are suggested for clinic care. Finally, some conclusions and future study directions are specifically discussed in the conclusion part."
Treatment Planning for Self-Shielded Radiosurgery,CUREUS,"A five degree of freedom, robotic, radiosurgical system dedicated to the brain is currently under development. In the proposed design, the machine is entirely self-shielded. The main advantage of a self-shielded system is the simplification of the system's installation, which can reduce the cost of radiosurgery. In this way, more patients can benefit from this minimally invasive and highly effective type of procedure. For technical reasons, space inside the shielded region is limited, which leads to constraints on the design. Here, two axes of rotation move a 3-megavolt linear accelerator around the patient's head at a source axis distance of 400 millimeters (mm), while the integrated patient table is characterized by two additional rotational, and one translational, degrees of freedom. Eight cone collimators of different diameters are available. The system can change the collimator automatically during treatment, using a collimator wheel. Since the linear accelerator can only move with two rotational axes, it is not possible to reposition the beam translationally (as it is in six degrees of freedom robotic radiosurgery). To achieve translational repositioning, it is necessary to move the patient couch. Thus, translational repositioning must be kept to a minimum during treatment. Our goal in this contribution is a preliminary investigation of dose distributions attainable with this type of design. Thus, we do not intend to design and evaluate the treatment planning system itself, but rather to establish that appropriate dose distributions can be achieved with this design under realistic clinical circumstances. Our simulation suggests that dose gradients and conformity for complex target shapes, corresponding to state-of-the-art systems, can be achieved with this construction, although a detailed evaluation of the system itself would be needed in the future."
Serious games may improve physician heuristics in trauma triage,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,"Trauma triage depends on fallible human judgment. We created two serious video game training interventions to improve that judgment. The interventions' central theoretical construct was the representativeness heuristic, which, in trauma triage, would mean judging the severity of an injury by how well it captures (or represents) the key features of archetypes of cases requiring transfer to a trauma center. Drawing on clinical experience, medical records, and an expert panel, we identified features characteristic of representative and nonrepresentative cases. The two interventions instantiated both kinds of cases. One was an adventure game, seeking narrative engagement; the second was a puzzle-based game, emphasizing analogical reasoning. Both incorporated feedback on diagnostic errors, explaining their sources and consequences. In a four-arm study, they were compared with an intervention using traditional text-based continuing medical education materials (active control) and a no-intervention (passive control) condition. A sample of 320 physicians working at nontrauma centers in the United States was recruited and randomized to a study arm. The primary outcome was performance on a validated virtual simulation, measured as the proportion of undertriaged patients, defined as ones who had severe injuries (according to American College of Surgeons guidelines) but were not transferred. Compared with the control group, physicians exposed to either game undertriaged fewer such patients [difference = -18%, 95% CI: -30 to -6%, P = 0.002 (adventure game); -17%, 95% CI: -28 to -6%, P = 0.003 (puzzle game)]; those exposed to the text-based education undertriaged similar proportions (difference = +8%, 95% CI: -3 to +19%, P = 0.15)."
STRUCTURE - TUBERCULOSTATIC ACTIVITY EVALUATION AMONG ISOMERIC BICYCLIC NITROIMIDAZOLES,ACTA POLONIAE PHARMACEUTICA,"Despite many existing treatment methods, the threat of tuberculosis (TB) is still a reality for millions of people worldwide. What is more, TB accounts the loss of two million lives annually as a result of e.z.. presence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) strains of M. tuberculosis. In the last decade, there has been growing interest in developing new substances that are efficient against M. tuberculosis. Among them, there are azole derivatives widely known as antifungal agents. Nowadays, some bicyclic nitroimidazoles (PA-824, CGI-17341, OPC-67683) undergoing clinical trials as promising tuberculostatic agents. In our study, bicyclic 7-nitroimidazo[5.1-b]-2,3-dihydrooxazoles. isomeric with CGI-17341 and 3-hydroxy-8-nitroimidazo[5.1-b]-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidines, which are structural isomers of the structure of PA-824 were synthesized and tested for their physicochemical properties. It has turned out that there are interesting differences between bicyclic isomers. In order to explain the reasons of the experimental disparities in biological activity of tested compounds and referenced nitroimidazooxazine PA-824. it was decided to carry out a molecular docking simulations."
Designing Virtual Patients for Education of Nursing Students in Cancer Course,IRANIAN JOURNAL OF NURSING AND MIDWIFERY RESEARCH,"Background: One of the best approaches to promote clinical reasoning in nursing education is Virtual Patient (VP). The purpose of this study was to design and implement VPs for nursing student's education in caring for cancer patients. Materials and Methods: In the first stage, through a descriptive-exploratory qualitative study using a focus group method, topics with higher priority in cancer nursing were identified. Then, based on the VP Nursing Design Model (VPNDM) for each of these topics, a scenario and then an interactive VP was designed and implemented in the Open Labyrinth application. The content validity of VPs was evaluated by eight experts and then the face validity was examined in the pilot group including 15 nursing students. Results: Topics with higher priority in cancer nursing courses were mastectomy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hypercalcemia, spinal cord compression, cardiac tamponade, and superior vena cava syndrome. For five scenarios based on the nursing process in three sequences (signs and symptoms, diagnosis and interventions) the VPs were designed. In this process, learning objectives, determining the critical path, adding branches at the decision point, adding feedback, completing the clinical course and related data, and adding multimedia were considered. VPs were revised based on the proposed modifications following face and content validity. Conclusions: This article presents VP design steps for use in a nursing student training course. The researchers were able to provide and validate five VPs to care for cancer patients based on the VPNDM."
"The ORVAC trial: a phase IV, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial of a third scheduled dose of Rotarix rotavirus vaccine in Australian Indigenous infants to improve protection against gastroenteritis: a statistical analysis plan",TRIALS,"ObjectiveThe purpose of this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, adaptive design trial with frequent interim analyses is to determine if Australian Indigenous children, who receive an additional (third) dose of human rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix, GlaxoSmithKline) for children aged 6 to < 12 months, would improve protection against clinically significant all-cause gastroenteritis.ParticipantsUp to 1000 Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (hereafter Indigenous) infants aged 6 to < 12 months will be recruited from all regions of the Northern Territory.InterventionsThe intervention is the addition of a third scheduled dose of human monovalent rotavirus vaccine.Co-primary and secondary outcome measuresORVAC has two co-primary outcomes: (1) anti-rotavirus IgA seroconversion, defined as serum anti-rotavirus IgA >= 20 U/ml 28 to 55 days post Rotarix/placebo, and (2) time from randomisation to medical attendance for which the primary reason for presentation is acute gastroenteritis or acute diarrhoea illness before age 36 months. Secondary outcomes include (1) change in anti-rotavirus IgA log titre, (2) time from randomisation to hospitalisation with primary admission code presumed or confirmed acute diarrhoea illness before age 36 months, (3) time from randomisation to hospitalisation for which the admission is rotavirus confirmed diarrhoea illness before age 36 months and (4) time from randomisation to rotavirus infection (not necessarily requiring hospitalisation) meeting the jurisdictional definition before age 36 months.DiscussionA detailed, prospective statistical analysis plan is presented for this Bayesian adaptive design.

"Potential Smoothened Inhibitor from Traditional Chinese Medicine against the Disease of Diabetes, Obesity, and Cancer",BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL,"Nowadays, obesity becomes a serious global problem, which can induce a series of diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, cancer, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and stoke. For the mechanisms of diseases, the hedgehog signaling pathway plays an important role in body patterning during embryogenesis. For this reason, smoothened homologue (Smo) protein had been indicated as the drug target. In addition, the small-molecule Smo inhibitor had also been used in oncology clinical trials. To improve drug development of TCM compounds, we aim to investigate the potent lead compounds as Smo inhibitor from the TCM compounds in TCM Database@Taiwan. The top three TCM compounds, precatorine, labiatic acid, and 2,2'-[benzene-1,4- diylbis(methanediyloxybenzene-4,1-diyl)]bis(oxoacetic acid), have displayed higher potent binding affinities than the positive control, LY2940680, in the docking simulation. After MD simulations, which can optimize the result of docking simulation and validate the stability of H-bonds between each ligand and Smo protein under dynamic conditions, top three TCM compounds maintain most of interactions with Smo protein, which keep the ligand binding stable in the binding domain. Hence, we propose precatorine, labiatic acid, and 2,2'-[benzene-1,4-diylbis(methanediyloxybenzene-4,1-diyl)] bis(oxoacetic acid) as potential lead compounds for further study in drug development process with the Smo protein."
Probabilistic analysis and computationally expensive models: Necessary and required?,VALUE IN HEALTH,"Objective: To assess the importance of considering decision uncertainty, the appropriateness of probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA), and the use of patient-level simulation (PLS) in appraisals for the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Methods: Decision-makers require estimates of decision uncertainty alongside expected net benefits (NB) of interventions. This requirement may be difficult in computationally expensive models, for example, those employing PLS. NICE appraisals published up until January 2005 were reviewed to identify those where the assessment group utilized a PLS model structure to estimate NB. After identifying PLS models, all appraisals published in the same year were reviewed. Results: Among models using PLS, one out of six conducted PSA, compared with 16 out of 24 cohort models. Justification for omitting PSA was absent in most cases. Reasons for choosing PLS included treatment switching, sampling patient characteristics and dependence on patient history. Alternative modeling approaches exist to handle these, including semi-Markov models and emulators that eliminate the need for two-level simulation. Stochastic treatment switching and sampling baseline characteristics do not inform adoption decisions. Modeling patient history does not necessitate PLS, and can depend on the software used. PLS addresses nonlinear relationships between patient variability and model outputs, but other options exist. Increased computing power, emulators or closed-form approximations can facilitate PSA in computationally expensive models. Conclusions: In developing models analysts should consider the dual requirement of estimating expected NB and characterizing decision uncertainty. It is possible to develop models that meet these requirements within the constraints set by decision-makers."
Interactive Education System for Practice of acute Use of Manual Defibrillator,2011 E-HEALTH AND BIOENGINEERING CONFERENCE (EHB),"Interactive patient simulators are more used during the education of healthcare professionals but also in the education of other professionals in the healthcare, e. g. biomedical engineer. The main advantage of interactive simulators is practical education focused on the simulation of real acute life-threatening situations that cannot be simulated on the real human patients mainly from the ethic reason. Another possibility of patient simulator usage is interaction with invasive medical equipment e. g. artificial lung ventilation or invasive hemodynamics monitoring. Defibrillators and pacemakers create a specific part of medical equipments that are used very often in the life-threatening situations. Their usage in the medical practice is fundamental and essential. The training of use of defibrillator or pacemaker is practically impossible in the clinical practice. Whole-body simulator enables special training of defibrillator usage with immediate evaluation of an effect on the patient. A special part of training session is debriefing which is used for detail analysis of the train session including the audio-visual record of the session. A defibrillator discharge can be displayed using a professional defibrillator tester. Whole education process can be monitored and evaluated from different point of view."
Compliance of Radiotherapy Treatment at a Tertiary Cancer Center in India-A Clinical Audit,INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND PAEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY,"Introduction Noncompliance to planned radiotherapy (RT) treatment is associated with inferior outcomes and also serves as an indicator of quality of care offered to the patients. Identification of the rate of noncompliance and its causative factors can help us develop an insight toward implementing mitigation measures thereby improving the quality of treatment. Objective To ascertain the incidence of noncompliance and the factors affecting the same in patients offered RT appointments. Materials and Methods We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019, who were noncompliant (defaulted RT simulation or defaulted initiation of RT or defaulted planned RT during the course of RT but excluding planned/unplanned treatment breaks or early conclusions prescribed by the treating radiation oncologist) for the planned RT treatment. Results Of the 8,607 appointments (7,699 external beam RT and 908 brachytherapy) given to the patients attending the radiation oncology outpatient department in the year 2019, a total of 197 (2.28%) patients were found to be noncomplaint. Ninety-seven patients defaulted RT simulation (49.2%), 53 defaulted RT starting (26.9%), and 47 defaulted while on RT (23.9%). Half of these had either head-neck (29.9%) or gynecological (20.8%) malignancies. Patients with breast cancers had the least noncompliance rates (0.02%). The cause for noncompliance was ascertained in 135 patients (68.5%). The common causes of noncompliance were the desire to continue treatment closer to home (21.5%) followed by logistic (17%), lack of confidence in the curative potential of the planned therapy (17%), and financial reasons (11.8%). Patients with head-neck and gynecological malignancies were more often with advanced staged disease and were planned multimodal treatment protocols. The majority of the 23 patients who defaulted palliative RT were planned for fractionated treatments (73.9%). Conclusion The incidence of noncompliance in patients planned for RT in our institute can be considered optimum. Appropriate counseling of patients at the time of scheduling appointment, upfront identification of patients at high risk of noncompliance, and assisting patients with financial and logistic challenges are imperative to ensure adherence to planned treatment schedule."
"Design, synthesis, biological evaluation and molecular dynamics studies of 4-thiazolinone derivatives as protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) inhibitors",JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS,"Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a key negative regulator of insulin signaling pathway, and more and more studies have shown that it is a potential target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this study, 17 new 4-thiazolinone derivatives were designed and synthesized as novel PTP1B inhibitors, and ADMET prediction confirmed that these compounds were to be drug-like. In vitro enzyme activity experiments were performed on these compounds, and it was found that a plurality of compounds had good inhibitory activity and high selectivity against PTP1B protein. Among them, compound 7p exhibited the best inhibitory activity with an IC50 of 0.92 mu M. The binding mode of compound 7p and PTP1B protein was explored, revealing the reason for its high efficiency. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations for the PTP1B(WT) and PTP1B(comp#7p) systems revealed the effects of compound 7p on PTP1B protein at the molecular level. In summary, the study reported for the first time that 4-thiazolinone derivatives as a novel PTP1B inhibitor had good inhibitory activity and selectivity for the treatment of T2DM, providing more options for the development of PTP1B inhibitors."
Modeling the Impact of a New Vaccine on Pneumococcal and Nontypable Haemophilus influenzae Diseases: A New Simulation Model,CLINICAL THERAPEUTICS,"Background: A heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) is available to immunize infants against pneumococcal disease. However, a recently developed vaccine, pneumococcal nontypable Haemophilus influenzae protein D-conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV), has recently been licensed. PHiD-CV contains 3 additional Streptococcus pneumoniae sero-types and may provide protection against nontypable H influenzae (NTHi) infection. New health economic models are required to model the impact of PHiD-CV and compare its effectiveness with PCV-7. Objectives: The aim of this article was to design a model capable of projecting the pneumococcal and NTHi disease burden on the entire UK population under different schedules of PCV-7 and PHiD-CV. This model should also be capable of modeling the net indirect effect of vaccination (le, the sum of serotype replacement and herd protection). Methods: A static, deterministic, age-compartmental model was created based on published information and the input of a board of experts in pneumococcal disease. The model presents results from both a payer-based and societal perspective. A 1-way sensitivity analysis was used to demonstrate the robustness of the model. Key parameters included the case fatality ratio for bacteremia, the hospitalization rate for acute otitis media (AOM), and parameters surrounding the extent of the net indirect effect of vaccination. Results: Excluding net indirect effect, 325 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), 619 hospitalizations for pneumonia, and 9016 general practitioner visits for AOM would be prevented annually with the current PCV-7 2 + 1 program. These numbers would increase to 374, 755, and 30,920, respectively, using a PHiD-CV 2 + 1 regimen, or to 503, 994, and 47,180 using a PHiD-CV 3 + 1 regimen. When a net indirect effect of 38% is considered, health benefits could be much larger; 2417, 2451, and 3045 IPD cases would be prevented in the 3 scenarios, respectively. Conclusions: It is predicted that any vaccination program in the United Kingdom would have a striking impact on the incidence of all outcomes analyzed. A PHiD-CV 3 + 1 schedule is predicted to have a greater effect than PCV-7 in all scenarios. While the primary purpose of vaccination would be to prevent IPD and pneumonia hospitalizations, an additional benefit would be a noticeable reduction in AOM incidence. While the predictions made by the model were based on informed reasoning, all of its projected estimations remain approximations that are dependent on the inputs used to configure it, a limitation that is common to all simulation models.

The role of amputation as an outcome measure in cellular therapy for critical limb ischemia: implications for clinical trial design,JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE,"Background: Autologous bone marrow-derived stem cells have been ascribed an important therapeutic role in No-Option Critical limb Ischemia (NO-CLI). One primary endpoint for evaluating NO-CLI therapy is major amputation (AMP), which is usually combined with mortality for AMP-free survival (AFS). Only a trial which is double blinded can eliminate physician and patient bias as to the timing and reason for AMP. We examined factors influencing AMP in a prospective double-blinded pilot RCT (2: 1 therapy to control) of 48 patients treated with site of service obtained bone marrow cells (BMAC) as well as a systematic review of the literature. Methods: Cells were injected intramuscularly in the CLI limbs as either BMAC or placebo (peripheral blood). Six month AMP rates were compared between the two arms. Both patient and treating team were blinded of the assignment in follow-up examinations. A search of the literature identified 9 NO-CLI trials, the control arms of which were used to determine 6 month AMP rates and the influence of tissue loss. Results: Fifteen amputations occurred during the 6 month period, 86.7% of these during the first 4 months. One amputation occurred in a Rutherford 4 patient. The difference in amputation rate between patients with rest pain (5.6%) and those with tissue loss (46.7%), irrespective of treatment group, was significant (p = 0.0029). In patients with tissue loss, treatment with BMAC demonstrated a lower amputation rate than placebo (39.1% vs. 71.4%, p = 0.1337). The Kaplan-Meier time to amputation was longer in the BMAC group than in the placebo group (p = 0.067). Projecting these results to a pivotal trial, a bootstrap simulation model showed significant difference in AFS between BMAC and placebo with a power of 95% for a sample size of 210 patients. Meta-analysis of the literature confirmed a difference in amputation rate between patients with tissue loss and rest pain. Conclusions: BMAC shows promise in improving AMP-free survival if the trends in this pilot study are validated in a larger pivotal trial. The difference in amp rate between Rutherford 4 & 5 patients suggests that these patients should be stratified in future RCTs."
The use of a virtual patient to follow pleural pressure changes associated with therapeutic thoracentesis,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL ORGANS,"Purpose: Influence of therapeutic thoracentesis on the pleural pressure (Pp) has been discussed in many clinical studies, however reasons of Pp changes are not precisely established. The aim of the study was to use a previously elaborated virtual cardiopulmonary patient (VP) in analysis of impact of physiological factors on Pp during the procedure. Methods: Simulations were performed on VP with default values of parameters for which VP simulated the respiratory system of the average 50-year-old healthy Polish woman according to spirometric examination. Alterations of Pp and the amplitude of Pp changes related to breathing (AP) were analyzed. Model parameters related to chosen factors were deviated from their default values to analyze the degree of their impact on Pp and AP. The analysis was based on and supported by our own clinical data. Results: The Pp and AP alteration intensity appeared to be most sensitive to the compliances of the rib cage and mediastinum, and the nonlinearity of the dependence between the recoil pressure and the lung volume: the lower the compliances and the higher the nonlinearity were, the deeper the Pp fall during the procedure and the bigger the AP increase were observed. Conclusions: Experiments in silico are very useful in analyzing sophisticated physiological and medical problems. They made it possible to show which factors are particularly responsible for changes in Pp during thoracentesis. In the future, they may be useful in establishing objective conditions under which thoracentesis needs to be stopped."
User Experience of Training Pediatric Students on Interactive Simulator During COVID-19 Pandemic,ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND PRACTICE,"Background: COVID-19 pandemic is a reason to revise traditional approaches to medical education. The disadvantage of online education is inability to train practical skills. Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of training students on an interactive pediatric simulator during distance learning. Patients and Methods: An online survey was conducted during quarantine COVID-19 to clear out the attitude to distance learning of third-year students of the Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University (n = 150). During training the level of students' motivation to learn decreased, and what is most important their practical skills deteriorated. Eighty-four out of 150 students had the effectiveness of their training on the multimedia simulator Filatov. Pediatrics analyzed. Results: The simulator reproduces clinical tasks using three-dimensional models of children of different ages and genders and has access to personal computers of students. The cases include imitation of a dialogue with a virtual patient, methods of physical examination, the appointment of laboratory and instrumental methods of research, treatment. The use of a pediatric simulator showed greater efficiency in mastering practical skills compared to a group of students who did not use the simulator in class. Summing up the results of the intermediate objective structured clinical exam (OSCE) on physical examination on dummies of the Simulation and Accreditation Center showed better results in the main group (n = 48) compared to the control (n = 36). The students who additionally studied on the simulator completed the tasks on the checklist on a cardiology dummy by 98.3 +/- 1.5%. In the control group, the percentage of completed tasks was 94.3 +/- 1.3 (p = 0.05). The OSCE for examining the respiratory system on an auscultative dummy revealed 97.3 +/- 1.5 and 93.1 +/- 1.4%, respectively (p = 0.05). Conclusion: The interactive pediatric simulator is a tool for mastering practical skills of medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the use of which the OSCE results are significantly higher."
The motor way: Clinical implications of understanding and shaping actions with the motor system in autism and drug addiction,COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE,"To understand others' minds is crucial for survival; however, it is quite puzzling how access to others' minds can be-to some extent-direct and not necessarily mediated by conceptual reasoning. Recent advances in neuroscience have led to hypothesize a role for motor circuits not only in controlling the elementary physical features of movement (e.g., force, direction, and amplitude), but also in understanding and shaping human behavior. The concept of motor cognition refers to these aspects, and neurophysiological, neuroimaging, and behavioral studies in human and nonhuman primates support this view. From a clinical perspective, motor cognition represents a challenge in several domains. A thorough investigation of the neural mechanisms mediating motor action/intention understanding and automatized/compulsive behaviors seems to be a promising way to tackle a range of neurodevelopmental and drug-related disorders. On the one hand, anomalies in motor cognition may have cascade effects on social functioning in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD); on the other, motor cognition may help explain the pathophysiology of drug-seeking and drug-taking behaviors in the most severe phase of drug addiction (i.e., see drug dependence, motor low-order cue reactivity). This may represent a promising approach that could improve the efficacy of rehabilitative interventions. The only way to shed light on multifactorial disorders such as ASD and drug addiction is through the investigation of their multiple factors. This motor way can promote new theoretical and experimental perspectives that would help bridge the gap between the basic neuroscience approach and clinical practice."
FSI Analysis of a Human Trachea Before and After Prosthesis Implantation,JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME,"In this work we analyzed the response of a stenotic trachea after a stent implantation. An endotracheal stent is the common treatment for tracheal diseases such as stenosis, chronic cough, or dispnoea episodes. Medical treatment and surgical techniques are still challenging due to the difficulties in overcoming potential complications after prosthesis implantation. A finite element model of a diseased and stented trachea was developed starting from a patient specific computerized tomography (CT) scan. The tracheal wall was modeled as a fiber reinforced hyperelastic material in which we modeled the anisotropy due to the orientation of the collagen fibers. Deformations of the tracheal cartilage rings and of the muscular membrane, as well as the maximum principal stresses, are analyzed using a fluid solid interaction (FSI) approach. For this reason, as boundary conditions, impedance-based pressure waveforms were computed modeling the nonreconstructed vessels as a binary fractal network. The results showed that the presence of the stent prevents tracheal muscle deflections and indicated a local recirculatory flow on the stent top surface which may play a role in the process of mucous accumulation. The present work gives new insight into clinical procedures, predicting their mechanical consequences. This tool could be used in the future as preoperative planning software to help the thoracic surgeons in deciding the optimal prosthesis type as well as its size and positioning.

ESHRE guideline:oval n s simulation for IVF/ICSI,HUMAN REPRODUCTION OPEN,"STUDY QUESTION: What is the recommended management of ovarian stimulation, based on the best available evidence in the literature? SUMMARY ANSWER: The guideline development group formulated 84 recommendations answering 18 key questions on ovarian stimulation. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Ovarian stimulation for IVF/ICSI has been discussed briefly in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline on fertility problems, and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologist has published a statement on ovarian stimulation in assisted reproduction. There are, to our knowledge, no evidence-based guidelines dedicated to the process of ovarian stimulation. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The guideline was developed according to the structured methodology for development of ESHRE guidelines. After formulation of key questions by a group of experts, literature searches and assessments were performed. Papers published up to 8 November 2018 and written in English were included. The critical outcomes for this guideline were efficacy in terms of cumulative live birth rate per started cycle or live birth rate per started cycle, as well as safety in terms of the rate of occurrence of moderate and/or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Based on the collected evidence, recommendations were formulated and discussed until consensus was reached within the guideline group. A stakeholder review was organized after finalization of the draft. The final version was approved by the guideline group and the ESHRE Executive Committee. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The guideline provides 84 recommendations: 7 recommendations on pre-stimulation management, 40 recommendations on LH suppression and gonadotrophin stimulation, 11 recommendations on monitoring during ovarian stimulation, 18 recommendations on triggering of final oocyte maturation and luteal support and 8 recommendations on the prevention of OHSS. These include 61 evidence-based recommendations-of which only 21 were formulated as strong recommendations-and 19 good practice points and 4 research-only recommendations. The guideline includes a strong recommendation for the use of either antral follicle count or anti-Mtillerian hormone (instead of other ovarian reserve tests) to predict high and poor response to ovarian stimulation. The guideline also includes a strong recommendation for the use of the GnRH antagonist protocol over the GnRH agonist protocols in the general IVF/ICSI population, based on the comparable efficacy and higher safety. For predicted poor responders, GnRH antagonists and GnRH agonists are equally recommended. With regards to hormone pre-treatment and other adjuvant treatments (metformin, growth hormone (GH), testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, aspirin and sildenafil), the guideline group concluded that none are recommended for increasing efficacy or safety. LIMITATIONS, REASON FOR CAUTION: Several newer interventions are not well studied yet. For most of these interventions, a recommendation against the intervention or a research-only recommendation was formulated based on insufficient evidence. Future studies may require these recommendations to be revised. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The guideline provides clinicians with clear advice on best practice in ovarian stimulation, based on the best evidence available. In addition, a list of research recommendations is provided to promote further studies in ovarian stimulation."
Estimation of treatment effects and model diagnostics with two-way time-varying treatment switching: an application to a head and neck study,LIFETIME DATA ANALYSIS,"Treatment switching frequently occurs in clinical trials due to ethical reasons. Intent-to-treat analysis without adjusting for switching yields biased and inefficient estimates of the treatment effects. In this paper, we propose a class of semiparametric semi-competing risks transition survival models to accommodate two-way time-varying switching. Theoretical properties of the proposed method are examined. An efficient expectation-maximization algorithm is derived to obtain maximum likelihood estimates and model diagnostic tools. Existing software is used to implement the algorithm. Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the validity of the model. The proposed method is further applied to data from a clinical trial with patients having recurrent or metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma of head and neck."
Numerical and experimental study of the influence of device pressure on PPG signal acquisition,OPTICAL INTERACTIONS WITH TISSUE AND CELLS XXXI,"The accuracy of non-invasive detection devices using photoplethysmography signal (PPG) for blood content often fails to meet the medical clinical standards. The reason for the error is partly due to theoretical algorithms, and partly due to the design of hardware. PPG signal acquisition device puts pressure on the skin during measurement, which affects the PPG signal. Aiming at this problem, this paper uses the finite element method to construct a skin model under pressure, and the optical transmission simulation experiment are used to analyze the changing trend of the reflected light intensity under different pressures. It was found that the change of reflected light intensity with pressure is related to the detection distance and wavelength. Simultaneously, the PPG sensor in our laboratory are used to carry out pressure experiments. The measured results verify simulation results. The influence of pressure on the DC, AC component and quality of PPG signals are analyzed ulteriorly. And we found the optimal pressure range is 0.4N similar to 1.2N for 7 subjects."
The Use of Expanded Polytetrafluoroethylene in Short Nose Elongation: Fourteen Years of Clinical Experience,ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY,"Background Short nose elongation is a relatively common rhinoplasty procedure, especially in Asia. The selection of the adequate graft material is challenging. Previous reports have described the application of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) for dorsal augmentation rhinoplasty, but studies using ePTFE for nose elongation are lacking. We propose ePTFE as an alternative treatment for short noses, describe the technique, and discuss outcomes, patient selection, and complications based on our 14-year experience. Methods From February 2003 to December 2016, 206 patients with varying degrees of short noses were included in this retrospective study. All patients underwent nose elongation surgery using an ePTFE implant. Nasal lengths before and after surgery were measured using a 3-dimensional simulation technology. Outcomes and complications including possible underlying reasons were analyzed. Patient satisfaction was evaluated using a self-assessment survey. Results Nasal elongation was successfully achieved using ePTFE. Mean increase in nasal length was 4.36 0.85 mm. The mean follow-up period was 13.3 months, ranging from 6 months to 8 years. Follow-up examinations demonstrated stable results. The overall complication rate was 6.8%. Complications included infection, implant extrusion, migration, deviation, visibility, and/or prominence, tissue reaction, and reddening of the nasal skin. Most patients (93.6%) rated their outcome as improved and much improved. Conclusions Nasal elongation using ePTFE implantation is a feasible therapeutic approach for patients with short noses. Reliable outcomes and the absence of donor site morbidity contribute to the high patient acceptance. Meticulous surgical technique and careful patient selection are prerequisites for successful results."
Economics of reducing antibiotic usage for clinical mastitis and metritis through genomic selection,JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE,"Antibiotics use (ABU) in animal agriculture has been implicated in the emergence of antibiotic resistance, a global public health threat. Economically justifiable antibiotic reduction strategies can motivate farmers to reduce ABU for clinical mastitis (CM) and metritis, the most common reasons for ABU on dairy farms. Our objective was to quantify the reduction in incidence of CM, metritis, and ABU, and the herd performance of a representative US herd that uses genomic selection for Lifetime Net Merit 2018 (NM$) selection index, compared with genetic selection based only on the mastitis (MAST) or metritis resistance (METR) trait or a health trait subindex (HTH$). A stochastic dynamic simulation model of a 1,000-cow herd with multi-trait genetics for 19 correlated traits included in the NM$ affected the performance of animals. The incidence of CM and metritis for each animal was affected by the genetic and environmental components of the MAST or METR, along with a standard phenotypic function that calculated the daily underlying herd probability to contract CM or metritis. Selection decisions were made based on genomic estimated breeding values of the traits of interest. A strategy named AI-NM$ based decisions on the NM$ trait so that the correlated genetic trends in MAST and METR are improved. Three other strategies named AI-MAST, AI-METR, and AI-HTH$ maximized respectively MAST, METR, and HTH$ genetic merit, but with a tradeoff in NM$ genetic merit. The cumulative true breeding values (TBV) of NM$ for 15 yr showed a difference of $4,947 per cow between the AI-NM$ (best strategy for NM$) and AI-METR (worst strategy for NM$). However, the 15-yr cumulative TBV of MAST was 26.50 percentage points (PP) higher in AI-MAST, and 18.5 PP higher for METR in AI-METR, compared with AI-NM$. As a result, the 15-yr cumulative phenotypic CM and metritis incidence was respectively 94.03 PP and 58 PP lower in AI-MAST and AI-METR compared with AI-NM$. Therefore the corresponding 15-yr cumulative ABU decreased by 42% in AI-MAST and by 53% in AI-METR. We found that AI-MAST had the lowest CM incidence across the 15 yr, whereas AI-METR had the lowest incidence of metritis and the smallest total ABU for 15 yr. To achieve the lowest incidence of CM, metritis, and ABU strategies AI-MAST, AI-METR, and AI-HTH$ had to incur 15-yr discounted cumulative lassos per cow of $1,486, $1,434, and $1,130, respectively, compared with AI-NM$. Hence, AI-NM$ had the best financial performance, despite having slightly higher incidence of CM, metritis, and ABU."
Comparative Effectiveness Research using Bayesian Adaptive Designs for Rare Diseases: Response Adaptive Randomization Reusing Participants,STATISTICS IN BIOPHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH,"Slow accrual rate is a major challenge in clinical trials for rare diseases and is identified as the most frequent reason for clinical trials to fail. This challenge is amplified in comparative effectiveness research where multiple treatments are compared to identify the best treatment. Novel efficient clinical trial designs are in urgent need in these areas. Our proposed response adaptive randomization (RAR) reusing participants trial design mimics the real-world clinical practice that allows patients to switch treatments when desired outcome is not achieved. The proposed design increases efficiency by two strategies: (i) Allowing participants to switch treatments so that each participant can have more than one observation and hence it is possible to control for participant specific variability to increase statistical power; and (ii) Using RAR to allocate more participants to the promising arms such that ethical and efficient studies will be achieved. Extensive simulations were conducted and showed that, compared with trials where each participant receives one treatment, the proposed participants reusing RAR design can achieve comparable power with a smaller sample size and a shorter trial duration, especially when the accrual rate is low. The efficiency gain decreases as the accrual rate increases."
Reducing Iatrogenic Risk in Thoracentesis Establishing Best Practice Via Experiential Training in a Zero-Risk Environment,CHEST,"Background: We studied the reasons why patients undergoing thoracenteses performed in our outpatient pulmonary clinic had a higher frequency of iatrogenic pneumothorax compared to that in the concurrent radiology practice in our institution, which utilizes ultrasound guidance. We reviewed our practice model and implemented a unique experiential training paradigm in a zero-risk simulation environment to improve efficacy, timeliness, service orientation, and safety. Methods; We retrospectively determined the rate of clinically significant pneumothoraces in our practice (phase 1, July 1, 2001, to June 30, 2002). The training system redesign included the following: (1) a designated group of pulmonologist instructors dedicated to treating pleural disease and reducing the number of iatrogenic complications; (2) the use of ultrasound image guidance for all thoracenteses; and (3) structured proficiency and competency standards for proceduralists. Postintervention (phase II) data were prospectively collected (January 2005 to December 006) and compared with our baseline data. Results: The baseline rate of pneumothorax was 8.6% (5 of 58 patients) in our pulmonary practice. Following intervention (phase II), the rate of pneumothorax declined to 1.1% (p = 0.0034). During phase II, the number of thoracenteses performed increased (186 vs 58 per year, respectively; p < 0.05). The iatrogenic pneumothorax rate was stable in the 2 years following intervention (2005, 0.7% [1 of 137 pneumothoraces]; 2006, 1.3% [3 of 226 pneumothoraces]; p > 0.9). Postintervention complications included procedure-related pain (n = 19), cough (n = 4), and hypotension (n = 10). Conclusions: An improvement program that included simulation, ultrasound guidance, competency testing, and performance feedback reduced iatrogenic risk to patients. We recommend application of this process to procedural practices. (CHEST 2009; 135:1315-1320)"
When to Introduce Three-Dimensional Visualization Technology into Surgical Residency: A Randomized Controlled Trial,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS,"Three-dimensional (3D) reconstructed images have been increasingly applied for medical education. Although many studies have described the benefits of such applications, the best time to introduce 3D technology into surgical training has not been determined. Therefore, we conducted a randomized study to determine a suitable period for the introduction of this technology. Seventy-one surgical residents were randomized into 2 groups (two-dimensional computed tomography (CT) group and 3D image group), and they completed a test on anatomy and imaging as well as a questionnaire. Post-graduate year 1 (PGY1) residents in the 3D group performed significantly better than those in the CT group, although the third-year residents did not present significant differences in either the score or the time spent answering the questions. Although residents in different years of training held different attitudes toward the difficulty of anatomy and imaging learning, they all showed a high level of acceptance of the 3D training. This study revealed that 3D images improved the junior residents' performance in imaging reasoning. Thus, systematically introducing 3D images early in a surgical resident training program may help produce a better anatomy-imaging-surgery system."
Randomised controlled trials evaluating endometrial scratching: assessment of methodological issues,HUMAN REPRODUCTION,"STUDY QUESTION: Do randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating endometrial scratching suffer from methodological issues including insufficient trial registration, statistical errors or irreproducibility, randomisation errors or miscellaneous issues? SUMMARY ANSWER: The majority of RCTs investigating endometrial scratching have methodological issues. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: A large number of small RCTs investigating the effectiveness of endometrial scratching prior to in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intrauterine insemination (IUI)/intercourse have reported favourable findings. Subsequently, systematic reviews incorporating these RCTs yielded meta-analyses in favour of endometrial scratching. Endometrial scratching has been widely adopted by infertility specialists around the world. Recently, an international RCT including 1364 women reported no benefit from endometrial scratching before IVF. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We evaluated several methodological issues of RCTs investigating the effectiveness of endometrial scratching prior to IVF and IUI/intercourse. We identified 25 RCTs for IVF and 12 RCTs for IUI/intercourse with full-text publication. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We assessed the RCTs on the following criteria: adequacy of trial registration, statistical issues (description of statistical methods and reproducibility of univariable statistical analysis), excessive similarity or difference in baseline characteristics that is not compatible with chance (Monte Carlo simulations and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and miscellaneous methodological issues. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Of 25 RCTs evaluating endometrial scratching prior to IVF, only eight (32%) had adequate trial registration. In total, 10 (40%) RCTs had issues regarding statistical methods. Nine (69%, 13 applicable) RCTs had at least one inconsistency between reported and reproduced univariable statistical analysis for categorical baseline/intermediate characteristics. Statistical results of at least one outcome were not reproducible in 14 (74%, 19 applicable) RCTs. Only two (8%) RCTs had none of the above issues. Suggested by the simulations, these RCTs did not significantly violate the null hypothesis that the baseline characteristics were the results of a properly conducted randomisation process (P = 0.4395). Of 12 IUI/intercourse RCTs, only 2 (17%) had adequate trial registration. In total, five (42%) studies had issues of statistical methods. Inconsistency between reported and reproduced univariable analysis for baseline/intermediate categorical variable(s) was found in four (57%, 7 applicable) RCTs. Statistical analysis was not reproducible for at least one outcome in eight (80%, 10 applicable) studies. All RCTs had at least one of the above issues. These RCTs were inconsistent with the null hypothesis that their baseline characteristics were the results of proper randomised allocation (P = 1.659(*)10(-7)). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: We were unable to assess RCTs which were not published as full-text papers. We could not analyse individual participant data to investigate possible reasons for statistical inconsistencies. The method to infer the likelihood of proper random sampling rests on assumptions including independent baseline characteristics, simple randomisation and no publication bias. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The methodological issues common to RCTs evaluating endometrial scratching may have biased the results of the trials. Further development and validation of these novel methods may be helpful for the critical appraisal of RCTs."
Comparison between simulation results and DEXA investigation of the bone remodelling after implanting a cementless long stem hip prosthesis,BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING-BIOMEDIZINISCHE TECHNIK,"Bone remodelling around a femoral prosthesis is one of the main reasons of aseptic loosening of the implant's stem. The difference in stiffness between the bone tissue and the prosthesis leads to unload the periprosthetic bone and thus to decrease the bone mineral density (BMD), which is known as stress shielding. This paper represents a comparison between measured changes in (BMD) in a periprosthetic Femur with a cementless Bicontact stem by prospective dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry study (DEXA)and calculated changes of the (BMD) using a finite element method (FEM). As a result, it is determined that the total deviation between the two investigations is about 18%."
Theoretical analyses and experimental validation of the effects caused by the fluorinated substituent modification of DNA,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Halogen-modified nucleic acid molecules, such as trifluorothymidine (FTD) and 5-fluorouracil, are widely used in medical science and clinical site. These compounds have a very similar nucleobase structure. It is reported that both of these compounds could be incorporated into DNA. The incorporation of FTD produces highly anti-tumor effect. However, it is not known whether to occur a significant effect by the incorporation of 5-fluorouracil. Nobody knows why such a difference will occur. To understand the reason why there is large differences between trifluorothymidine and 5-fluorouracil, we have performed the molecular dynamics simulations and molecular orbital calculations. Although the active interaction energy between Halogen-modified nucleic acids or and complementary adenine was increased, in only FTD incorporated DNA, more strongly dispersion force interactions with an adjacent base were detected in many thermodynamic DNA conformations. As the results, the conformational changes occur even if it is in internal body temperature. Then the break of hydrogen bonding between FTD and complementary adenine base occur more frequently. The double helix structural destabilization of DNA with FTD is resulted from autoagglutination caused by the bonding via halogen orbitals such as halogen bonding and the general van der Waals interactions such as CH-pi, lone pair (LP)-pi, and pi-pi interactions. Therefore, it is strongly speculated that such structural changes caused by trifluoromethyl group is important for the anti-tumor effect of FTD alone."
Study on hemodynamics in patient-specific thoracic aortic aneurysm,THEORETICAL AND APPLIED MECHANICS LETTERS,"The objective of this study is to investigate the hemodynamics in patient-specific thoracic aortic aneurysm and discuss the reason for formation of aortic plaque. A 3-Dimensional pulsatile blood flow in thoracic aorta with a fusiform aneurysm and 3 main branched vessels was studied numerically with the average Reynolds number of 1399 and the Womersley number of 19.2. Based on the clinical 2-Dimensional CT slice data, the patient-specific geometry model was constructed using medical image process software. Unsteady, incompressible, 3-Dimensional Navier-Stokes equations were employed to solve the flow field. The temporal distributions of hemodynamic variables during the cardiac cycle such as streamlines, wall shear stresses in the arteries and aneurysm were analyzed. Growth and rupture mechanisms of thoracic aortic aneurysm in the patient can be analyzed based on patient-specific model and hemodynamics simulation.

Thirty-two component finite element models of a horse and donkey digit,EQUINE VETERINARY JOURNAL,"Reasons for performing study: The finite element (FE) method is the most powerful modelling technique available to explicate the biomechanics of the digit. It has already proved to be of high value in human podiatry. However, accurate models of the complex anatomy of the horse and donkey digit are currently lacking. Objectives: To develop FE models of the horse and donkey digit from computed tomography data, including all functionally relevant anatomy, and to perform simulations to replicate prestrain in the flexor tendons and quasistatic weightbearing. Methods: Computed tomography data of the front right digits were obtained under general anaesthesia. The anatomy was rationalised into 32 functional components. The FE models were generated using a forward engineering technique. Linear or nonlinear material properties were applied according to published data. Prestraining of the flexor tendons was achieved by z-direction displacement, and loading by the application of 1 x body mass. Results: The resultant FE models comprised over 106 elements. Z-direction displacement of the digital flexor tendons to compensate for general anaesthesia relaxation gave von Mises stress levels up to 1.34 MPa for the deep and 0.56 MPa for the superficial in the horse and 0.78 MPa and 0.27 MPa in the donkey, respectively. Weightbearing resulted in capsular deformation patterns consistent with in vivo observations, and maximum stress levels of 1.46 MPa for the horse and 0.89 MPa for the donkey. Conclusion: These high resolution FE models could give new insight into the biomechanics of the equid digit and provide new data regarding stress and strain levels within the tissues of the digit that are unobtainable by other means. Potential relevance: Application of the FE modelling technique could enable investigation of the biomechanics of orthopaedic problems and may provide a mechanistic basis for enhanced preventative and remedial management and treatment."
"The effect of experience, simulator-training and biometric feedback on manual ventilation technique",VETERINARY ANAESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA,"Objective To determine the frequency of provision and main providers (veterinary surgeons, nurses or trainees) of manual ventilation in UK veterinary practices. Furthermore, to determine the variation in peak inspiratory (inflation) pressure (PIP), applied to a lung model during manual ventilation, by three different groups of operators (inexperienced, experienced and specialist), before and after training. Study design Questionnaire survey, lung model simulator development and prospective testing. Methods Postal questionnaires were sent to 100 randomly selected veterinary practices. The lung model simulator was manually ventilated in a staged process over 3 weeks, with and without real-time biometric feedback (PIP display), by three groups of volunteer operators: inexperienced, experienced and specialist. Results The questionnaires determined that veterinary nurses were responsible for providing the majority of manual ventilation in veterinary practices, mainly drawing on theoretical knowledge rather than any specific training. Thoracic surgery and apnoea were the main reasons for provision of manual ventilation. Specialists performed well when manually ventilating the lung model, regardless of feedback training. Both inexperienced and experienced operators showed significant improvement in technique when using the feedback training tool: variation in PIP decreased significantly until operators provided manual ventilation at PIPs within the defined optimum range. Preferences for different forms of feedback (graphical, numerical or scale display), revealed that the operators' choice was not always the method which gave least variation in PIP. Conclusions and clinical relevance This study highlighted a need for training in manual ventilation at an early stage in veterinary and veterinary nursing careers and demonstrated how feedback is important in the process of experiential learning. A manometer device which can provide immediate feedback during training, or indeed in a real clinical setting, should improve patient safety."
Geriatrics for surgeons: Infusing life into an aging subject,JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION,"PURPOSE: Geriatric patients have specific medical and social needs for which surgeons must become adept at caring. In an effort to improve the care of the elderly, we have committed to developing a geriatric component for our surgical curriculum that is part of our PGY2-protected block curriculum. Competencies covered by this curriculum plan include medical knowledge, systems-based practice, professionalism, patient care, practice-based learning, and communication skills. METHODS: The geriatrics curriculum is imbedded in our current protected block curriculum and includes 5 separate sessions during the PGY2 year. During the protected block Curriculum, the residents (N = 7) are relieved of all clinical activity, including call. A needs assessment survey assessed the residents' perceptions of the residency program Is current focus on geriatric principles. The geriatric portion of this curriculum uses small-group instructional methods consistent with adult learning principles that include practice-based learning, case-based learning, patient simulation using Objective Structured Video Examination (OSVE), and didactic sessions. Faculty instruction is a shared responsibility between geriatricians and general surgeons. The longitudinal geriatrics curriculum includes approximately 10 hours of learner activities over a single-year period. EVALUATION: The curriculum will be evaluated by assessing participant knowledge through the use of multiple-choice testing. Resident performance on OSVEs will likewise be assessed. This method will allow for assessment of higher decision making and clinical reasoning. Finally, a family meeting OSCE will be used to assess professionalism and communication skills further. Overall, all 6 competencies will be assessed using our specific assessment tools. The curriculum content and instructional delivery will be evaluated using longitudinal and session evaluation forms. RESULTS AND EXPERIENCE TO DATE: The geriatrics curriculum will be implemented fully over 2 years. Three sessions will be introduced during the 1st year, and 2 more will be implemented in the 2nd year. The needs assessment survey results demonstrated a lack Of sufficient educational focus on geriatrics topics and a low comfort level in caring for the elderly patient. The 1st session of the curriculum has taken place with positive results. The Ist session was a case-based session that focused on critical care and end-of-life issues in the elderly. Although the medical knowledge data are limited thus far, the average pretest score was 57% compared with the 86% posttest score. The resident evaluations (N = 7) of the session demonstrated an average 4.7 (1-5 Likert scale) for content and a 3.9 (1-4 Likert scale) for instructional delivery. CONCLUSION AND NEXT STEPS: Elderly Surgical patients have multiple challenges. Specific geriatric training for Surgical trainees is lacking. Over the next 2 years, the curriculum will be developed and evaluated even more for its ability to provide adequate instruction in the specific care of the elderly surgical patient. The ultimate goal is to improve the care of the elderly surgical patient."
"Multimedia in cardiology education: An interactive and case-based instructional program on myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and mitral stenosis.",MEDIZINISCHE KLINIK,"Background: Principles in the field of cognitive psychology and problem-based learning together with recent progress in multimedia technologies are providing the basis for the development of case-based and computer-assisted learning systems. With reference to the information-overload of theoretical and factual knowledge in medical education these programs can be an efficient tool to satisfy the current need for new, practical, skill-related forms of knowledge transfer. Methods: Apple-Macintosh Computers were selected to develop interactive, multimedia patient-simulations on mitral stenosis, angina pectoris and myocardial infarction. Instructional aim and contents: The user acquires knowledge and skills about the leading symptoms, differential diagnoses, the use and analysis of laboratory examinations and the process of diagnostic reasoning while working through the computer-simulated cases. Pedagogical design and conclusion: Important pedagogical principles associated with computer-assisted learning were employed in the program. Clinical situations can be simulated repeatedly and for every student in an authentic manner. Therefore the program can serve as a preparation for and a supplement to practical clinical education. Compared to conventional teaching media the development of instructional multimedia software requires a tremendous amount of time and resources. Thus, controlled studies are important to objectify the overall advantages such programs can have."
Developing a Serious Game for Nurse Education,JOURNAL OF GERONTOLOGICAL NURSING,"Future nursing education is challenged to develop innovative and effective programs that align with current changes in health care and to educate nurses with a high level of clinical reasoning skills, evidence-based knowledge, and professional autonomy. Serious games (SGs) are computer-based simulations that combine knowledge and skills development with video game-playing aspects to enable active, experiential, situated, and problem-based learning. In a PhD project, a video-based SG was developed to teach nursing students nursing care for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in home health care and hospital settings. The current article summarizes the process of the SG development and evaluation."
Restoration of Nusinersen Levels Following Treatment Interruption in People With Spinal Muscular Atrophy: Simulations Based on a Population Pharmacokinetic Model,CNS DRUGS,"Background Nusinersen is approved for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy. The most common approved dosing regimen is four intrathecal loading doses of nusinersen 12 mg; the first three are administered at 14-day intervals followed by a fourth dose 30 days later, and then 12-mg maintenance doses are administered every 4 months thereafter. Interruption of nusinersen treatment in the maintenance dosing phase might occur for a number of clinical reasons. Objective The objective of this report is to describe dosing regimens that allow for the most rapid restoration of steady-state concentrations of nusinersen in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) following a treatment interruption during maintenance dosing. Methods Population pharmacokinetic models using integrated pharmacokinetic data from ten nusinersen clinical trials that included a broad range of participants with spinal muscular atrophy treated with intrathecal nusinersen were used to investigate different durations of treatment interruptions during maintenance treatment. Potential dosing regimens for re-initiation of nusinersen were evaluated, with the goal of achieving the quickest restoration of steady-state nusinersen CSF concentrations without exceeding maximal CSF exposures observed during the initial loading period. Results Our pharmacokinetic modeling indicates the following regimen will lead to optimal restoration of nusinersen CSF levels after treatment interruption: two doses of nusinersen should be administered at 14-day intervals following treatment interruptions of >= 8 to < 16 months since the last dose, and three doses of nusinersen at 14-day intervals for treatment interruptions of >= 16 to < 40 months since the last maintenance dose, with subsequent maintenance dosing every 4 months in both instances. After treatment interruptions of >= 40 months, the full loading regimen will rapidly restore nusinersen CSF levels. Conclusions Prolonged treatment interruptions lead to suboptimal CSF levels of nusinersen. The optimal regimen to restore nusinersen CSF levels depends on the interval since the last maintenance dose was administered. Plain Language Summary Nusinersen is a drug used to treat people of all ages who have spinal muscular atrophy. Nusinersen is injected with a thin needle into the lower back, a procedure known as a lumbar puncture. People initially receive three doses of nusinersen 12 mg each 14 days apart. They receive a fourth dose 1 month later, and then injections every 4 months (known as maintenance dosing). This treatment plan allows nusinersen to build up to effective levels in the fluid surrounding the spinal cord and brain. Some people may miss dose(s) or may stop nusinersen treatment at some point during maintenance dosing and then may want to continue treatment. This study used information from ten clinical trials to find out the best way to restart treatment to build up nusinersen to effective levels. People with a treatment break of >= 8 to < 16 months since the last dose need two doses of nusinersen at 14-day intervals before receiving maintenance dosing. People with a treatment break of >= 16 to < 40 months since the last dose need three doses of nusinersen at 14-day intervals before receiving maintenance dosing. If people stopped treatment for >= 40 months, they would need four doses before starting maintenance treatment. Results from this study showed that the number of doses that people needed before starting maintenance treatment depended on how long the treatment break was."
An inception cohort study assessing the role of pneumococcal and other bacterial pathogens in children with influenza and ILI and a clinical decision model for stringent antibiotic use,ANTIVIRAL THERAPY,"Background: Influenza-like illness (ILI) is a common reason for paediatric consultations. Viral causes predominate, but antibiotics are used frequently. With regard to influenza, pneumococcal coinfections are considered major contributors to morbidity/mortality. Methods: In the context of a perennial quality management (QM) programme at the Charite Departments of Paediatrics and Microbiology in collaboration with the Robert Koch Institute, children aged 0-18 years presenting with signs and symptoms of ILI were followed from the time of initial presentation until hospital discharge (Charite Influenza-Like Disease = ChILD Cohort). An independent QM team performed highly standardized clinical assessments using a disease severity score based on World Health Organization criteria for uncomplicated and complicated/progressive disease. Nasopharyngeal and pharyngeal samples were collected for viral reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and bacterial culture/sensitivity and MaldiTOF analyses. The term 'detection' was used to denote any evidence of viral or bacterial pathogens in the (naso)pharyngeal cavity. With the ChILD Cohort data collected, a standard operating procedure (SOP) was created as a model system to reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics in children with ILI. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to assess cost-effectiveness. Results: Among 2,569 ChILD Cohort patients enrolled from 12/2010 to 04/2013 (55% male, mean age 3.2 years, range 0-18, 19% > 5 years), 411 patients showed laboratory-confirmed influenza, with bacterial co-detection in 35%. Influenza and pneumococcus were detected simultaneously in 12/2,569 patients, with disease severity clearly below average. Pneumococcal vaccination rates were close to 90%. Nonetheless, every fifth patient was already on antibiotics upon presentation; new antibiotic prescriptions were issued in an additional 20%. Simulation of the model SOP in the same dataset revealed that the proposed decision model could have reduced the inappropriate use of antibiotics significantly (P< 0.01) with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of -99.55(sic). Conclusions: Physicians should be made aware that in times of pneumococcal vaccination the prevalence and severity of influenza infections complicated by pneumococci may decline. Microbiological testing in combination with standardized disease severity assessments and review of vaccination records could be cost-effective, as well as promoting stringent use of antibiotics and a personalized approach to managing children with ILI."
How to use vancomycin optimally in neonates: remaining questions,EXPERT REVIEW OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,"In neonates, vancomycin, a narrow-spectrum antibiotic, is the first choice of treatment of late-onset sepsis predominantly caused by Gram-positive bacteria (coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci). Although it has been used for >50 years, prescribing the right dose and dosing regimen remains a challenge in neonatal intensive care units for many reasons including high pharmacokinetic variability, increase in the minimal inhibition concentration against staphylococci, lack of consensus on dosing regimen and way of administration (continuous or intermittent), duration of treatment, use of therapeutic drug monitoring, limited data on short- and long-term toxicity, risk of mutant selection and errors of administration linked to concentrated formulations. This article highlights and discusses future research directions, with specific attention given to dosing optimization of vancomycin, including the advantages of modeling and simulation approaches."
Impact of target-mediated drug disposition on hetrombopag pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in Chinese healthy subjects and patients with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,"Aims The pharmacokinetics (PK) of hetrombopag were found to be nonlinear across evaluated dose ranges. The aim of this study was to develop a mechanism-based population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PopPK/PD) model and to provide a reasonable expected therapeutic dose for a future confirmatory clinical study of hetrombopag. Methods Nonlinear mixed-effects modelling was performed using pooled 2168 hetrombopag concentrations and 1526 platelet counts from 72 healthy subjects and 32 chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients from two phase I studies and one phase II study. The final model was evaluated via goodness-of-fit plots, visual predictive check and nonparametric bootstrap. Simulations from the validated PopPK/PD model were used to devise an expected therapeutic dose for later confirmatory clinical study. Results The pharmacokinetic data of hetrombopag were well described by a modified target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) model with dual sequential first-order absorption. Mean parameter estimates (interindividual variability) were CL/F 7.66 L/h (63.5%), V-c/F 30.0 L (77.2%) and K-deg 0.693/h (87.1%). The pharmacodynamic profile was well described by a five-compartment lifespan model with four-transit and one-platelet compartments. Simulation results suggested that chronic ITP patients following 10 mg once-daily hetrombopag would able to achieve an ideal platelet count level (50-200 x 10(9)/L). Conclusion TMDD was the primary reason leading to nonlinear PK profile of hetrombopag. Our PK/PD modelling and simulation results support 10 mg once-daily as the recommended therapeutic dose for chronic ITP patients in subsequent confirmatory clinical study of hetrombopag."
Development of critical thinking in health professions education: A meta-analysis of longitudinal studies,CURRENTS IN PHARMACY TEACHING AND LEARNING,"Introduction: While reports of critical thinking exist in the health professions literature, development of critical thinking across a broad range of health-professions students has not been systematically reviewed. Methods: In this meta-analysis, multiple databases and journals were searched through February 2016 to identify longitudinal studies using standardized tests of critical thinking [California Critical Thinking Skills Test (CCTST), Health Science Reasoning Test (HSRT), and Defining Issues Test (DIT)] in any language. Two reviewers extracted information and collected information regarding primary author, publishing journal, health profession, critical thinking test, and time1/time2 means and standard deviations. Standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported using a random-effects model. Results: Four hundred sixty-two studies were screened, and 79 studies (representing 6884 students) were included. Studies contained 37 CCTST, 22 DIT, and 20 HSRT. Health professions comprised nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, dentistry, medicine, veterinary medicine, dental hygiene, clinical laboratory sciences, and allied health. Cohen's kappa was strong (0.82) for inter-reviewer agreement. Both the CCTST (SMD = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.23-0.52) and DIT (SMD = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.18-0.39) demonstrated significant increases in total scores, but the HSRT (SMD = 0.03, 95%CI = -0.05-0.12) did not show improvement. Discussion/Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, students from the majority of health professions consistently showed improvement in development of critical thinking. In this diverse population, only the CCTST and DIT appeared responsive to change."
Effects of high and low prior knowledge on construction of a joint problem space,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL EDUCATION,"The participants were 4th-year medical students designing a clinical trial to test a new hypothetical anticancer drug. They worked with the computer simulation the Oncology Thinking Cap in facilitated groups that differed in terms of their prior knowledge. Both groups engaged in constructive activity and reached similar endpoints. The groups differed qualitatively in how they went about constructing and navigating the joint problem space. The high-prior-knowledge group used their knowledge to help them construct plans, evaluate their actions, and stay focused on the goals of the experimental design task. The low-prior-knowledge group searched through the data exhaustively and used them to generate their plans. They were unsystematic in their planning and interpretation. They used the computer representations in their reasoning and worked at mapping the connections between the representations. The computer scaffolding played an important role for both groups, but the facilitator played a greater role in the low-prior-knowledge group."
The performance of the log rank test for different relationships between the hazards: the case of the triangular test in comparison with some other sequential tests,COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION,"Sequential designs are widely used in medical research for the reason being one of ethics to terminate or alternate a trial as soon as significant evidence are available that saves time, cost and other resources. The most popular and frequently used sequential framework in real life is the Triangular Test with the Christmas tree correction for the important statistical properties that it possesses. Often the log-rank test is used in clinical medicine, and it has been found to be more efficient when the hazards of intervention groups are proportional. Therefore, this study intends to identify the performance of the log-rank test for different relationships between the Hazards departures from proportional hazards in the framework of the sequential design of the Triangular Test as well as some other sequential designs. The results indicate that the log-rank test maintains the desirable significance level when the interim sample size consists of 200 or a greater number of patients for the Triangular design. Moreover, the study findings include that the power of the test is high when proportional hazard is satisfied. The Triangular design performs better with respect to type I error as well as power."
"The Sale of Antibiotics without Prescription in Pharmacies in Catalonia, Spain",CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES,"Background. Current regulations in Spain state that antibiotics cannot be sold without a medical prescription. The objective of this study was to quantify the percentage of pharmacies selling antibiotics without an official medical prescription in Catalonia, Spain, by the simulation of 3 different clinical cases presented by actors. Methods. A prospective study was performed from January through May 2008. Three different cases were presented at pharmacies: sore throat, acute bronchitis, and a urinary tract infection. Three levels of demand were used to convince the pharmacists to sell an antibiotic. Results. A total of 197 pharmacies were visited. Antibiotics were obtained from 55 (79.7%) of 69 pharmacies when a urinary tract infection was simulated, 24 (34.8%) of 69 pharmacies when a sore throat was simulated, and 10 (16.9%) of 59 pharmacies when acute bronchitis was simulated, Among the pharmacies that P < .001 sold antibiotics, the pharmacists provided an explanation as to the number of times per day the drug should be taken in 84.3%, explained the duration of treatment in 68.7%, and inquired about allergies prior to the sale of the antibiotic in only 16.9%. Of the 108 pharmacies that did not sell the antibiotics, only 57 (52.8%) explained that they could not be given over the counter for health care reasons or to avoid antibiotic resistance. Conclusions. These results demonstrate that, although illegal, the sale of antibiotics without a prescription continues in Spain. This should be taken into account by countries that are currently considering the possibility of making some antibiotics available over the counter."
Comparative study of the interaction of meso-tetrakis (N-para-trimethyl-anilium) porphyrin (TMAP) in its free base and Fe derivative form with oligo(dA.dT)(15) and oligo(dG.dC)(15),JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS,"Interaction between a cationic porphyrin and its ferric derivative with oligo(dA.dT)(15) and oligo(dG.dC)(15) was studied by UV-vis spectroscopy, resonance light scattering (RLS), and circular dichroism (CD) at different ionic strengths; molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation were also used for completion. Followings are the observed changes in the spectral properties of meso-tetrakis (N-para-trimethyl-anilium) porphyrin (TMAP), as a free-base porphyrin with no axial ligand, and its Fe derivative (FeTMAP) upon interaction with oligo(dA.dT)(15) and oligo(dG.dC)(15): (1) the substantial red shift and hypochromicity at the Soret maximum in the UV-vis spectra; (2) the increased RLS intensity by increasing the ionic strength; and (3) an intense bisignate excitonic CD signal. All of them are the reasons for TMAP and FeTMAP binding to oligo(dA.dT)(15) and oligo(dG.dC)(15) with the outside binding mode, accompanied by the self-stacking of the ligands along the oligonucleotide helix. The CD results demonstrated a drastic change from excitonic in monomeric behavior at higher ionic strengths, which indicates the groove binding of the ligands with oligonucleotides. Molecular docking also confirmed the groove binding mode of the ligands and estimated the binding constants and energies of the interactions. Their interaction trend was further confirmed by molecular dynamics technique and structure parameters obtained from simulation. It showed that TMAP reduced the number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds and increased the solvent accessible surface area in the oligonucleotide. The self-aggregation of ligands at lower concentrations was also confirmed."
A utility maximization approach for information-communication tradeoff in Wireless Body Area Networks,PERSONAL AND UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING,"Healthcare systems have made a dramatic shift towards ubiquitous monitoring in the recent past. The reasons for such a change have been ease of timely diagnosis, convenience and comfort of clinical treatments. Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) are mainly characterized by deployment of biomedical sensors around human body which transmit vital signs measurements about the health status of the patient. Unfortunately, the huge traffic load of clinical data and limited resources of biomedical sensors make the efficiency of long-term operations almost impossible. Therefore, it is necessary to make significant advances in sensor's energy saving. Our idea is to reduce the activities of some sensors depending on the relevance between the data they measure and the diseases to detect. This paper shows how to extend the lifetime of medical WBANs by appropriately taking benefit of correlation between the knowledge about the disease and sensing data to drive the best scheduling of the medical sensors. For that, the theoretical framework of an economic approach, i.e., network utility maximization, is developed for sensor scheduling under operations cost constraint. It is shown that the compact subset of sensors can be found to provide necessary information for timely and correct diagnoses. Based on the theoretical framework, an algorithm combining sensor selection and information gain is then proposed. Simulation results show that the algorithm achieves high performance in terms of energy saving vs latency in disease detection."
A literature review: graduate nurses' preparedness for recognising and responding to the deteriorating patient,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING,"Aims and objectives To explore the research literature that provided data on factors that influence new graduate nurse's preparedness for recognition and response to patient deterioration in the acute care setting. Background Nurses have a significant role in recognising subtle signs of patient deterioration and responding appropriately to prevent adverse events and improve patient outcomes. This pivotal position has often fallen to the new graduate who must be prepared to make high-consequence decisions in relation to a suspected decline in their patient's condition. Design and methods An integrative review was undertaken. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using online databases, reference lists of key articles and expert advice. Multiple keyword combinations were used. All relevant studies were subsequently appraised for rigour and quality. Seventeen primary research studies drawn from novice and experienced registered nurse experiences emerged as relevant to the review. Results Thematic analysis of the studies provided six major themes related to the aim of the review. Emergent themes were as follows: clinical staff support, lack of nurse experience, overwhelming workload, holistic patient assessment, past experiences and lack of available resources. Conclusions This review highlighted the importance of positive staff support and subsequent confidence building. Graduates then felt able to present effective assessments and less fearful of reprimand when escalating an intervention call. The need for further research to investigate graduate nurses' experiences of recognising and responding to the deteriorating patient emerged. Relevance to clinical practice Realistic workloads and access to supportive experienced staff would allow graduates time to focus on grouping clinical information to understand the total picture of the patient. Results indicated undergraduate and hospital in-service education programmes needed to offer the opportunity to practice reasoning. Complex clinical situations involving patient deterioration through simulation and clinical placement opportunities appeared most useful."
Impaired recognition of facial expressions of anger in Parkinson's disease patients acutely withdrawn from dopamine replacement therapy,NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA,"We have previously reported that acute dopaminergic blockade in healthy volunteers results in a transient disruption of the recognition of facial expressions of anger, whilst leaving intact the recognition of other facial expressions (including fear and disgust) and facial identity processing. Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by cell loss in dopaminergic neuronal populations, and hence we predicted that PD would be associated with impaired anger recognition. We reasoned that treatment with dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) could mask any deficit present in PD, and therefore studied facial expression recognition in a group of PD patients transiently withdrawn from DRT. Seventeen PD patients were compared to 21 age- and IQ-matched controls on the Ekman 60 task, which required the forced-choice labelling of 10 exemplars of each of six facial expressions (anger, disgust, fear, sadness, happiness, surprise). In line with our predictions, PD patients showed a selective impairment in the recognition of facial expressions of anger. This deficit was not related to the PD patients' performance on the Benton unfamiliar-face matching task, which was normal, nor was the deficit related to overall disease severity, or to depression symptoms. However, as predicted by simulation theories, impaired anger recognition in PD was related to reduced levels of the anger-linked temperament trait, exploratory excitability. The results extend our previous findings of a role for dopamine in the processing of facial expressions of anger, and demonstrate the power of adopting a phylogenetic, comparative perspective on emotions.

Weekly variation of hospital admissions for stroke in Nis (Serbia),CLINICAL NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY,"Objectives: Weekly variability in stroke occurrence could be related to the change in behaviors of patients or medical personnel that occur during certain periods of the week. The aim of the present study was to examine the weekly variation in hospital admissions for stroke in Nis (Serbia), as well as to investigate how the demographic factors influenced these changes. Patients and methods: The main data source for this study was the Nis Stroke Registry. During the study period (1996-2007) a total of 9675 stroke patients were registered. According to stroke subtypes, all registered patients were divided into three groups: patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) (438 or 4.5%), patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) (1576 or 16.3%) and patients with ischemic stroke (IS) (6946 or 71.8%). Analyses were conducted separately for SAH, ICH and IS. Each stroke type was stratified by gender, age group and education level. Results: We have showed that there is a significant weekly variability in the number of SAH (p = 0.028) and IS (p < 0.001) admissions, with the minimum number of admissions on Sundays (39.27 and 14.04% less than expected), and the maximum one on Tuesdays (21.46% more than expected) and Wednesdays (10.96% more than expected), respectively. We have also registered more SAH (p = 0.015) and IS (p < 0.001) admissions on weekdays than on weekend days. Conclusion: Results of this hospital-based study confirm that there is a pattern in the variation of the number of stroke admissions on the weekly level. Reasons for the weekly variation of hospital admissions for stroke cannot be determined from the present study. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Evaluating the relevance of dosimetric considerations to patient instructions regarding skin care during radiation therapy,JOURNAL OF RADIOTHERAPY IN PRACTICE,"Introduction: Patient teaching in radiation therapy may include restrictions on applying skin products owing to concerns that the presence of such materials may increase skin dose. These restrictions may create unnecessarily complicated and conflicting self-care instructions. Purpose: To determine what thickness of skin product is necessary to produce a clinically meaningful dose increase to the skin, and provide recommendations for evidence-based patient instructions. Methods: Dosimetric measurements and Monte Carlo simulations were used to calculate skin dose under 0-1? 5mm thicknesses of two common classes of skin product for a variety of treatment geometries. The thickness of product required to produce a clinically significant dose increase to the skin was determined. Results: The thickness of product required to create a clinically meaningful dose increase was.0 center dot 7mm for 10 x 10 cm(2) fields and.1 center dot 5mm for 1 x 1cm(2) fields. A typical application of product would be only 0 center dot 3mm. Conclusion: It seems unrealistic to anticipate patients using sufficiently large quantities of skin product to be of clinical concern. We therefore recommend that there are no dosimetric reasons to restrict the use of these types of skin products during radiation therapy for common treatment scenarios."
Testing and approach when non-organic visual loss is suspected,OPHTHALMOLOGE,"Approximately 5% of the patients in the ophthalmological practice suffer from non-organic vision loss. In children non-organic vision loss has been observed from the age of 6 years. In order to be able to make a rapid diagnosis knowledge of the relevant clinical tests is decisive. If a patient shows signs of non-organic visual loss, diagnostic externalization of the visual function is crucial. Depending on the symptoms there are various tests, which can be used to differentiate between organic and non-organic disorders. For therapeutic and economic reasons an early diagnosis of a non-organic visual loss is crucial. Ophthalmologists need to differentiate between malingering and augmentation, where the patient is aware of the fraud and tries to gain personal benefit from it, and somatoform disorders. In the latter, a more sensitive approach is recommended."
A Simple Approach to the Estimation of Incidence Rate Difference,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY,"The incidence rate difference (IRD) is a parameter of interest in many medical studies. For example, in vaccine studies, it is interpreted as the vaccine-attributable reduction in disease incidence. This is an important parameter, because it shows the public health impact of an intervention. The IRD is difficult to estimate for various reasons, especially when there are quantitative covariates or the duration of follow-up is variable. In this paper, the authors propose an approach based on weighted least-squares regression for estimating the IRD. It is very easy to implement because it boils down to performing ordinary least-squares regression analysis of transformed variables. Furthermore, if the outcome events are repeatable, the authors propose that data on all events be analyzed instead of first events only. Four versions of the Huber-White robust standard error are considered for statistical inference. Simulation studies are used to examine the performance of the proposed method. In a variety of scenarios simulated, the method provides an unbiased estimate for the IRD, and the empirical coverage proportion of the 95% confidence interval is very close to the nominal level. The method is illustrated with data from a vaccine trial carried out in the Gambia in 2001-2004."
Modelling the PKPD of oxycodone in experimental pain - Impact of opioid receptor polymorphisms,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES,"Background: Polymorphisms in the opioid receptor genes may affect the pharmacodynamics (PD) of oxycodone and be part of the reason behind the diversity in clinical response. The aim of the analysis was to model the exposure-response profile of oxycodone for three different pain variables and search for genetic covariates. Model simulations were used to predict how population and effect-size impact the power to detect clinical significant SNPs. Method: The population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model of oral single-dosed oxycodone was based on pooled data from three published studies in healthy volunteers. Pain tolerance data from muscle pressure (n = 36), visceral pressure (n = 54) and skin pinch (n = 34) were included. Genetic associations with 18 opioid-receptor SNPs were explored using a stepwise covariate approach. Model simulations were performed using the estimated model parameters. Results: None of the selected SNPs were associated with analgesic response of oxycodone at P < 0.001. Baseline response in muscle cuff pressure was associated with OPRK1 rs7016778 and rs7824175 (P < 0.001). Simulations indicated that large differences in drug response between genotypes (>50% for similar population sizes) or large populations (n > 200 for a 20% response difference) are necessary to identify clinical significant SNP effects due to high population variability. Conclusion: A population PKPD model has been developed for oral oxycodone using three different pain variables to explore impact of genetic covariates and study design. None of the selected polymorphisms were significantly associated with analgesic response of oxycodone, but an association of baseline response in muscle cuff pressure with two OPRK1 SNPs was identified.

Vaginal Hysterectomy Rates Before and After Implementation of a Multiple-Tier Intervention,OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY,"OBJECTIVE: To assess a multiple-tier intervention to increase vaginal hysterectomy rates. METHODS: We performed a cohort study assessing hysterectomy performance before and after implementation of a multiple-tier intervention to increase vaginal hysterectomy rates at a single tertiary care medical center. This intervention involved resident and attending education and simulation, professional development, design of a clinical pathway to assist in hysterectomy decision making, and development of a surgical mentorship program. RESULTS: Data from 698 hysterectomies (253 preintervention and 445 postintervention) were included. The preintervention time period extended from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017 (24 months), and the postintervention period from January 1, 2018, to February 28, 2020 (26 months). The intervention was implemented over the month of December 2017 but was not complete until January 1, 2018. The preintervention and postintervention cohorts were similar in most demographic and clinical aspects. Postintervention, the proportion of vaginal hysterectomies was higher (26.5% vs 5.5%, odds ratio 6.2, 95% CI 3.52-11.35), including in those performed for reasons other than prolapse (6.8% vs 0%, P<.001). Logistic regression revealed that prolapse, uterine weight less than 250 g, and surgery during the postintervention cohort were significantly associated with vaginal hysterectomy. Operative complications did not differ significantly by hysterectomy type. CONCLUSION: Implementation of a multiple-tier intervention was associated with an increase in vaginal hysterectomies."
TEACHING MEDICINE WITH CASES - STUDENT AND TEACHER OPINION,MEDICAL EDUCATION,"In a second-year family medicine course taught using simulated patients the students commented most favourably on the clinical relevance of the topics, the enthusiasm of teachers, and the opportunity to interview simulated patients with their fellow students, in contrast to their basic science courses, which did not give them patient contact. They felt most confident about skills acquired in relation to diseases with a limited number of key symptoms, signs and treatments (meningitis, otitis) and less confident about diseases with many symptoms and treatments (diabetes, trauma, arrhythmias). They made few comments about alternative cases which might have been selected. Their adverse comments were about the workload. During tutor meetings over 4 years, a key concern which emerged was to find cases with a level of complexity suitable to the students. The tutors emphasized these principles of case selection: the cases should be based on real life and include most of the signs and symptoms of the disease; contain one or at most two foci; have nodal decision-making points; emphasize clinical reasoning; reinforce prior knowledge; permit the transfer of knowledge to other cases; and permit the assessment of associated technical skills."
Digital Image Watermarking for Tele-Nuclear Medicine Images,2009 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER ENGINEERING AND SYSTEMS (ICCES 2009),"Tele-Nuclear Image watermarking is not only for authentication, but also for nuclear images protection against malicious intentions to change or even use it for other person for any reason. Nuclear images are low resolution images so they have special requirements for image watermarking as watermarked images should not differ from their original images because of the clinical reading of the images. In this paper implementation of three different watermarking algorithms in the frequency domain will be presented. The first algorithm is based on the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), the second one is based on the Discrete Laguerre Transform (DLT) and the third algorithm is based on the Discrete Tchebichef Transform (DTT). Embedding the watermark is done by modifying the coefficients of the middle frequency band within region of non-interest (RONI) so that the visibility of the image and diagnosis capability will not be affected and the watermark will not be removed by compression. All schemes are tested using medical images and the simulation results are compared and the comparison shows that the best scheme is that based on using DTT."
Design and Development of an Automated Feedback and Scoring System for Self-directed Learning of Flexible Nasal Endoscopy With an Airway Simulator,SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE-JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR SIMULATION IN HEALTHCARE,"Introduction: The AirSim Multi (TruCorp) airway simulator is used to practice exploration of the upper respiratory tract with a flexible endoscope to assess the nasal cavities, their structures and spaces (inferior, middle, and superior turbinates and meati), and the nasopharynx. The passage of the flexible endoscope through the nose is usually the most annoying and painful maneuver to continue the exploration of the airway to the pharynx and larynx. For this reason, it is important to develop self-assessment training systems in safe environments that allow trainees to develop the necessary skills to carry out this type of assessment with the least inconvenience and the greatest security. Despite this simulator's accurate anatomical reproduction of the tract, its suitability as a tool for endoscope exploration learning is limited without a feedback system. Effective endoscopic exploration should not cause pain or lesions, not only for comfort and safety reasons, but also because only when discomfort is minimized is a complete and detailed exploration of the anatomical structures possible. The objective of the project was to provide a feedback system from the simulator to the trainee that would facilitate improvements in self-trained skills needed to perform an endoscopic exploration of the airways. Methods: A device based on the Hall-effect sensor was designed and placed outside the airway in the upper nasal turbinate. This device detects changes in the magnetic flux, indicating a displacement on the nasal turbinate due to endoscopic maneuvers that deform the inside of the simulator and would be expected to be harmful or painful in real life. Results: The improved AirSim provides audible and visual feedback during exploration to indicate a change on the nasal turbinate due to endoscopic contact with the turbinate surface that would be expected to be harmful or painful in real life. We expect this feature to facilitate self-learning with minimal professional supervision and reduce the overall training time required to successfully perform a complete exploration of the airway. Conclusions: The inclusion of sensors on a passive simulator is a cost-effective measure that may allow for better training experiences using AirSim Multi simulator from the TruCorp company. Our improved simulator turns endoscopic exploration into a self-assessed exercise suitable for all disciplines and level of learners."
Frequency of recurrent events at failure time: Modeling and inference,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION,"Recurrent events arise in many longitudinal medical studies where time to a terminal event or failure is the primary endpoint. With incomplete follow-up data, the analysis of recurrent events is a challenge owing to their association with the failure. One specific quantity of interest rarely addressed in the statistical literature is the recurrence frequency at the failure time; an example is hospitalization frequency, which is often used as a rough measure of lifetime medical cost. In this article we show that a marginal model (e.g., the log-linear model) of the recurrence frequency, although desirable, is typically not identifiable. For this reason, we advocate modeling the recurrent events and the failure time jointly, and propose an approach to forming semiparametric joint models from prespecified marginal ones. We suggest two conceptually simple and nested regression models aiming at the recurrence frequency as a mark of the failure and at the process of recurrent events. We formulate monotone estimating functions and propose novel interval-estimation procedures to accommodate nonsmooth estimating functions. The resulting estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal. Simulation studies and the application to an AIDS clinical trial exhibit that these proposals are easy to implement and reliable for practical use. Finally, we generalize our proposals to marked recurrent events, and also devise a global inference procedure for recurrent events of multiple types."
Cost-effectiveness of different surgical treatment approaches for early breast cancer: a retrospective matched cohort study from China,BMC CANCER,"BackgroundBoth breast-conserving surgery and breast reconstruction surgery are less popular in China, although they can improve patients' quality of life. The main reason comes from the economy. There is currently no economic evaluation of different surgical treatment options for early breast cancer. Our study aims to assess the economic impact and long-term cost-effectiveness of different surgical treatments for early breast cancer. The surgical approaches are including mastectomy (MAST), breast-conserving therapy (BCT), and mastectomy with reconstruction (MAST+RECON).MethodsBased on demographic data, disease-related information and other treatments, we applied propensity score matching (PSM) to perform 1: 1 matching among patients who underwent these three types of surgery in the tertiary academic medical center from 2011 to 2017 to obtain a balanced sample of covariates between groups. A Markov model was established. Clinical data and cost data were obtained from the medical records. Health utility values were derived from clinical investigations. Strategies were compared using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).ResultsAfter PSM, there were 205 cases in each group. In the matched data set, the distribution of covariates was fully balanced. The total cost of MAST, MAST+RECON and BCT was $37,392.84, $70,556.03 and $82,330.97, respectively. The quality-adjusted life year (QALYs) were 17.11, 18.40 and 20.20, respectively. Compared with MAST, MAST+RECON and BCT have an ICER of $25,707.90/QALY and $14,543.08/QALY, respectively. The ICER of BCT vs. MAST was less than the threshold of $27,931.04. The reliability and stability of the results were confirmed by Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis.ConclusionsWe believe that in the context of the limited resources in China, after comparing the three surgical approaches, BCT is the more cost-effective and preferred solution."
"Hurdles, Barriers, and Successes of a National Living Donor Kidney Exchange Program",TRANSPLANTATION,"Background. Living donor kidney exchange is now performed in several Countries. However, no information is available on the practical problems inherent to these programs. Here, we describe Our experiences with 276 Couples enrolled in the Dutch program. Methods. Our protocol consists of five steps: registration, Computerized matching, crossmatching, donor acceptation, and transplantation. We prospectively collected data of each step of the procedure. Results. Of the 276 registered pairs we created 183 computer-matched combinations. However, 62 of 183 recipients proved to have a positive crossmatch with their new donor, which was not predicted by the screening results of the recipient centers. Alternative solutions were found for 39 couples, resulting in a total of 160 new combinations with negative crossmatches. Thereafter, because of 22 individual clinical problems, the exchange procedure had to be discontinued for 51 couples while only for 19 of them alternative solutions were found. At the end of day, 128 patients had received exchange kidneys, 55 were transplanted outside the program, 59 are still oil the crossover waitlist, and 34 had left the program for medical or psychological reasons. Conclusion. A living donor kidney exchange program is a dynamic process. Many clinical hurdles and barriers are encountered that for a large part were not foreseen but should be taken into account When programs are initiated based on computer simulations. Success is dependent oil a flexible organization able to create alternative solutions when problems arise. Centralized allocation and crossmatch procedures are instrumental in this respect."
A Study of the Effect of Integrated Education of Professional Operating Room Skills on the Undergraduate Operating Room Students' Professional Self-Concept,BRAIN-BROAD RESEARCH IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE,"Introduction: Professional self-concept is an individual's perception of himself as a professional and influences his thinking, role evolution, professional behavior and performance. Integrated education technique provides the opportunity for interaction and feedback at higher levels of learning. Among employed job, nursing needs to be further enhanced by professional self-concept. Therefore, present study aimed to determine the effect of integrated education of operating room skills on the undergraduate operating room students' professional self-concept. Background and objective Professional skills training and patient safety have become ever-increasing challenges for operating room instructors and students. Integrated education technique provides the opportunity for interaction and feedback at higher levels of learning. Applying this approach results in the discovery of knowledge and active learning, and facilitates the learning of problem-solving skills, creative critical thinking, clinical reasoning, and self-efficacy. The present study aimed to study the effect of integrated education of professional operating room skills on the undergraduate operating room students' professional self-concept. Methods: In this experimental study, 104 undergraduate operating room students who were studying the Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences were selected as samples and randomly divided into two experimental and control groups. In both groups, the participants filled the research questionnaires before and immediately after the intervention (participating in an education program). The control group was taught only by the typical program and the experimental group weekly participated in 6sessions of blended education program. Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test was used to investigate the data normality. In addition, independent t-test, paired t-test, chi-square test and Fisher test were used to analyze the data. Results: According to the results of present study, in the experimental group, there was a significant difference between the mean self-concept scores of the operating room students before and after the intervention (P = 0.005). Thus, the intervention increased the mean self-concept score. Also, the greatest change was observed in the leadership dimension. Conclusion: The trainings designed with the purpose of developing the students' professional skills and provide a positive image of the profession, can increase the operating room students' professional self-concept."
Do we see what we think we see? The complexities of morphological assessment,JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY,"Reliable pathological interpretation is vital to so many aspects of tissue-based research as well as being central to patient care. Understanding the complex processes involved in decision-making is the starting point to improve both diagnostic reproducibility and the definition of diagnostic groups that underpin our experiments. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of research in this field and it is encouraging to see The Journal of Pathology publishing work in this area. This review attempts to highlight the opportunities that exist in this field and the technologies that are now available to support this type of research. Key amongst these are the use of decision analysis tools such as inference networks, and virtual microscopy that allows us to simulate diagnostic decision-making. These tools have roles, not only in studying the subtleties of diagnostic decision-making, but also in delivering new methods of training and proficiency testing. Research which helps us to better understand what we see, why we see it, and standardizing interpretative reasoning in pathological classification is essential for improving the wide range of activities that pathologists support, including clinical diagnosis, teaching, training, and experimental research.

Survival analysis of hierarchical learning curves in assessment of cardiac device and procedural safety,STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,"Many Americans rely on cardiac surgical procedures and devices such as pacemakers and thrombolytic catheters to treat or manage their cardiovascular diseases. However, the failure of these cardiac devices and procedures could have grave consequences. One reason cardiac devices tended to fail was due to physician error; there is a learning effect for the physician or operator to come up to speed in skillfully implanting devices and conducting procedures. In order to better understand these learning effects, we had previously modeled the resulting learning curve effects in simulations a hierarchical setting with physicians clustered within institutions using our unique methodology (see the work of Govindarajulu et al 2017). Previously, we had employed these in hierarchical linear modeling and also in generalized estimating equations. In this setting, we have demonstrated how to apply similar methodology but revised in a survival analytic framework or time-to-event analyses. Through simulations and real dataset applications, we found that, out of the three shapes modeled to fit the learning curve, the logarithmic shape tended to have the best fit, similar to previous work (see the work of Govindarajulu et al 2017). However, as seen before, modeling the learning rate can be dataset specific and one shape may be better than another. We learned that modeling the learning rate could also be applied in the survival analysis setting through this new methodology. The goal of this paper is to model cardiac device and procedure learning curve effects in a time-to-event setting so that this knowledge may allow for the improvement of both short and long-term patient survival."
Common flaws exist in published cost-effectiveness models of pharmacologic stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY,"Objectives: Decision makers use models to assist in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of pharmacologic stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (SPAF). Study Design and Setting: We performed a search of databases through October 3, 2012 to identify pharmacologic SPAF cost-effectiveness models. Results: Of 30 identified models, 28 included warfarin, but only 60% assessed the impact of warfarin control on conclusions. Aspirin, dual antiplatelet, and newer anticoagulants were included in 41%, 10%, and 63% of models, respectively. Models used similar structures but included varying health states and made varying assumptions. They rarely reported performing a literature search to identify anticoagulant-specific inputs and used similar and older sources. Sixteen models used a lone randomized trial to reflect the efficacy and safety of main comparisons. One-third of models claimed a societal perspective; however, none included indirect costs. Patients typically initiated anticoagulation in the sixth or seventh decade of life and are followed for their lifetimes. Almost 70% of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were below reported willingness-to-pay thresholds. All used deterministic sensitivity analyses and 77% conducted Monte Carlo simulation. Less than half of the models were rated high quality, yet were frequently published in high-impact journals. Conclusion: Pharmacologic SPAF cost-effectiveness models have been extensively reported, but many may have flaws giving reason for decision makers to use caution. We provide 10 recommendations to avoid common flaws in SPAF cost-effectiveness models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Patient-specific finite element analysis of popliteal stenting,MECCANICA,"Nitinol self-expanding stents are used for the endovascular management of peripheral artery diseases of the popliteal artery, which is located behind the knee joint. Unfortunately, the complex kinematics of the artery during the leg flexion leads to severe loading conditions, favouring the mechanical failure of the stent, calling for a specific biomechanical analysis. For this reason, in the present study we reconstruct by medical image analysis the patient-specific popliteal kinematics during leg flexion, which is subsequently exploited to compute the mechanical response of a stent model, virtually implanted in the artery by structural finite element analysis (FEA). The medical image analysis indicates a non-uniform configuration change of the artery during the leg flexion, leading to an increase of the vessel curvature above the knee. The computed mechanical response of the stent reflects the non-uniform configuration change of the artery as after the flexion the average stress is higher in the part of the stent located above the knee. Although the proposed analysis is limited to a case-study, it shows the capability of patient-specific FEA simulations to compute the mechanical response of a stent model subjected to the complex and severe loading conditions of the popliteal artery during leg flexion."
vivaGen - a survival data set generator for software testing,BMC BIOINFORMATICS,"Background: Software testing is an essential part of the software development process, but real-world data may not be suited or available for testing purposes. In the medical context, it can be especially hard to get the necessary test data for various reasons such as privacy concerns. To overcome these obstacles and provide data for the necessary thorough tests of software, the generation of simulated data sets can be a solution. In this paper, we focus on the challenging task of generating such survival data sets containing known effects. So far, no user-friendly software exists for the simulation of survival data, as they are typically derived from clinical trials with follow-ups. Results: To overcome these shortcomings, we developed an easy to use software package called vivaGen. In our Java software, parameters of survival time distributions are replaced by comprehensive measures that can be configured more intuitive by practitioners. vivaGen is equipped with a graphical frontend that allows users to adjust parameters and visualize the results in survival plots of the simulated cohorts. Conclusions: vivaGen is freely available and published as open source. It provides a novel way to generate test data sets based on probability distributions in a comprehensive and user-friendly way."
"Rapid Access Palliative Radiation Therapy Clinics: The Evidence Is There, but Where Are the Clinics? An Australian and New Zealand Perspective",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS,"Purpose: First developed in Canada in the 1990s, Rapid Access Palliative Radiation Therapy (RAPRT) clinics have subse-quently spread internationally to expedite treatment for near end-of-life patients, sparing them the need for multiple visits to the department. A classical RAPRT clinic is herein defined as a dedicated clinic specifically established to enable (ideally) same day consultation, planning for, and delivery of palliative radiation treatment. The aim of this work was to determine the current status of these clinics in Australia and New Zealand (ANZ). Methods and Materials: A phone survey of all 100 Australian and 10 NZ radiation therapy centers was conducted in March and April 2021. The Chief Medical Officers of the 2 large private practices (GenesisCare and Icon) also approved the survey and answered on behalf of their 57 centers. A single page questionnaire was used, seeking information on the logistics and clinical details of past and present RAPRT clinics, and reasons why other centers do not have one. Results: The survey response rate was 100%. There are only 3 current RAPRT clinics (2.7%). The dominant treatment indica-tion is bone metastases (85%-90%), with most patients receiving single fractions (60%-90%), but commencement on the same day is variable (35%-90%). Five other clinics (4.5%) closed after 4 months to 7 years, but the clinical features were similar. By far, the most common reason (95%) given by the 107 centers without a current RAPRT clinic was that these patients are accommodated using existing resources. Conclusions: Classical RAPRT clinics have not been widely embraced in ANZ. There are alternative strategies such as the Advanced Practice Radiation Therapist model and techniques to avoid the conventional computed tomography-simulation step, which may also expedite treatment for palliative patients.

Predicting drug-drug interactions: application of physiologically based pharmacokinetic models under a systems biology approach,EXPERT REVIEW OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,"The development of in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE), a 'bottom-up' approach, to predict pharmacokinetic parameters and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) has accelerated mainly due to an increase in the understanding of the multiple mechanisms involved in these interactions and the availability of appropriate in vitro systems that act as surrogates for delineating various elements of the interactions relevant to absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination. Recent advances in the knowledge of the population variables required for IVIVE (demographic, anatomical, genetic and physiological parameters) have also contributed to the appreciation of the sources of variability and wider use of this approach for different scenarios within the pharmaceutical industry. Initially, the authors present an overview of the integration of IVIVE into 'static' and 'dynamic' models for the quantitative prediction of DDIs. The main purpose of this review is to discuss the application of IVIVE in conjunction with physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling under a systems biology approach to characterize the potential DDIs in individual patients, including those who cannot be investigated in formal clinical trials for ethical reasons. In addition, we address the issues related to the prediction of complex DDIs involving the inhibition of cytochrome P-and transporter-mediated activities through multiple drugs."
Potential costs and consequences associated with medication error at hospital discharge: an expert judgement study,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HOSPITAL PHARMACY,"Objectives Assessing the cost-effectiveness of complex pharmaceutical care interventions and medication error outcomes is hindered by lack of available data on actual outcomes consequent to errors that were intercepted for patient safety reasons. Expert judgement is an approach to acquire data regarding unknown parameters in an economic model which are otherwise insufficient or not possible to obtain. The aim of this paper is to describe a method to approach this problem using findings from a single intervention study and to calculate the potential costs and consequences associated with discharge medication error. Methods Using data from a previous intervention study, the hypothetical consequences of medication error(s) at hospital discharge, in terms of diagnosis, healthcare resource utilisation and impact on health-related quality of life, were identified by expert judgement of anonymised cases. Primary healthcare utilisation costs were derived from published tariffs, inpatient costs were derived by simulation in the hospital discharge activity database test environment and the difference between adjudicated baseline and posterror health state was expressed as quality-adjusted life year (QALY) decrement. Results Four experts provided judgement on 81 cases. Of these, 75 were judged to have potential clinical consequences. Between 56 and 69 of the 81 cases were variably judged to require remedial healthcare utilisation. The mean calculated cost per case (representing an individual patient), based on all 81 cases, was euro1009.58, 95% CI 726.64 to 1585.67. The mean QALY loss was 0.03 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.05). Conclusion An expert judgement process proved feasible and useful to estimate financial cost and QALY loss associated with hospital discharge medication error. These estimates will be employed in model-based economic evaluation. This method could be transferred to other prospective observational patient safety research which seeks to assess value for money of complex interventions."
Internet-based teaching and learning in ophthalmology,OPHTHALMOLOGE,"The transmission of clinical knowledge occurs traditionally through lectures, theoretical and practical courses, bed-side teaching as well as case-oriented teaching in small groups. The realisation is, however often very laborious and problematical because of low resources. For these reasons the development of computer-based, and in particular internet-based tutorials have increased dramatically in recent years. Furthermore,the transmission of knowledge by means of internet-based tutorials offers several advantages. The content can be quickly updated and multimedia presentations are possible. The use of these sources is normally independent of time and location. The possibilities of internet-based teaching and learning are on-line lectures, case simulations and online quizzes. At present the number of ophthalmological applications on the internet is still restricted. Internet-based multimedial tutorials represent a meaningful supplement to traditional forms of teaching. Especially in ophthalmology, a visual presentation of details can be performed in an easier way via multimedial tools and the training is followed without causing stress for the patients."
An extension of Bayesian predictive sample size selection designs for monitoring efficacy and safety,STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,"Most exploratory clinical trials in cancer are designed as single-arm trials using a binary efficacy outcome with or without interim monitoring. In this context, we have proposed a Bayesian adaptive design denoted as predictive sample size selection design (PSSD), which considered a binary efficacy outcome associated with early futility stopping (Statistics in Medicine 2012; 31: 4243-4254). As a matter of course, it would be more ethical and informative to evaluate safety as well as efficacy during the course of a trial. However, in most of the trials, only major adverse events are taken into account for early termination of the trial, and safety itself is used as a secondary endpoint. In this paper, we propose an extension of the PSSD to monitor efficacy, take into consideration the sample size adaptation during the trial and add continuous monitoring of safety to the trial design. This method is developed in the Bayesian framework, in which a decision to stop for reasons of safety can be made based on the posterior probability or predictive probability, not necessarily at the time of pre-specified monitoring for efficacy. We investigate the operating characteristics of the proposed method through simulation studies and show that the posterior probability-based method with less informative prior to monitor safety has more reasonable performance.

Power: Establishing the Optimum Sample Size,EPIDEMIOLOGY AND MEDICAL STATISTICS,"This paper focuses on power, which is the probability that a real clinical pattern will be detected. Power depends on (a) the effect size, (b) the sample size, and (c) the significance level. But if the clinical researcher knew the size of the effect, there would be no reason to conduct the research! Researcher designers use power analysis to minimize the likelihood of both false positives and false negatives (Type I and Type II errors, respectively). Both software and simulation approaches to establishing power in research design are described in this paper. Basic software, such as SamplePower1.0, is effective for establishing power for means, proportions, ANOVA, correlation, and regression. Advanced softwares, such as UnifyPow and PASS, establish power for more complex designs. generalized estimating equations (GEEs) are designed for correlated data. Complex designs such as repeated measures ANOVA. Monte Carlo simulations provide an alternative and a validity check for software power analyses. Criteria for establishing sample sizes that are large enough, but not too large, are discussed."
Trends in national licensing examinations in medicine,MEDICAL EDUCATION,"ContextAs a contribution to this special issue commemorating the journal's 50th volume, this paper seeks to explore directions for national licensing examinations (NLEs) in medicine. Increases in the numbers of new medical schools and the mobility of doctors across national borders mean that NLEs are becoming even more important to ensuring physician competence. ObjectivesThe purpose of this paper is to explore the use of NLEs in the future in the context of global changes in medical education and health care delivery. MethodsBecause the literature related to NLEs is so large, we have not attempted a comprehensive review, but have focused instead on a small number of topics on which we think we have something useful to say. The paper is organised around five predicted trends for NLEs. DiscussionThe first section discusses reasons why we think the use of NLEs will increase in the coming years. The second section discusses the ongoing problem of content specificity and its implications for the design of NLEs. The third section examines the evolution of large-scale, standardised cognitive assessments in NLEs and suggests some future directions. Reflecting the fact that NLEs are, increasingly, attempting to assess more than just knowledge, the fourth section addresses the future of large-scale clinical skills assessments in NLEs, predicting both increases in their use and some shifts in the nature of the stations used. The fifth section discusses workplace-based assessments, predicting increases in their use for formative assessment and identifying some limitations in their direct application in NLEs. The concluding section discusses the cost of NLEs and indulges in some further speculations about their evolution. Discuss ideas arising from the article at discuss."
Nature of Emergencies and Measures Applied by an Emergency Physician During Pre-Hospital Pediatric Emergencies A Retrospective Analysis Based on Practice Data from one Emergency Region,NOTARZT,"Zusammenfassung Praklinische Kindernotfalle stellen fur Notarzte besonders fordernde Einsatzsituationen dar. Untersucht wurden Notfallspektrum und Haufigkeit invasiver Ma ss nahmen bei padiatrischen Notfallen; auch im Kontext der individuellen Aus- und Weiterbildung nichtpadiatrischer Notarzte. Retrospektive Auswertung der Notarzteinsatzprotokolle (2009-2014) bei Patienten bis zum vollendeten 14. Lebensjahr am Notarztstandort Bad Oeynhausen (Kreis Minden-Lubbecke). Der Anteil von Kindernotfallen an den Gesamteinsatzen betrug 3,4% (n=321). Von diesen waren in 22,7% der Falle Sauglinge (0-1 Jahre), in 36,6% Kleinkinder (2-6 Jahre) und in 40,8% Schulkinder (7-14 Jahre) betroffen. Das Spektrum umfasste mehrheitlich respiratorische Storungen (20,9%), neurologische Erkrankungen (30,8%) und Traumata (28,3%). Bis zum 6. Lebensjahr dominierten akute Erkrankungen, bei alteren Kindern standen Traumata im Vordergrund. 64,4% der Patienten erhielten eine Medikamentenapplikation, bei 5,9% wurde eine Reposition durchgefuhrt; Raritaten waren die Intubation (1,2%) und die Reanimation (0,9%). Ein intravenoser Zugang wurde in 34,4% gelegt. Im Notarztdienst sind praklinische Kindernotfalle und die damit notwendigen Ma ss nahmen zwar relativ selten, sollten aber den Notarzt nicht unvorbereitet treffen. Ohne eine klinische Schwerpunkttatigkeit oder eine langjahrige Erfahrung mit entsprechender Aus- und Weiterbildung ist der Erwerb individueller Fertigkeiten, insbesondere beim Atemwegs- und Traumamanagement oder der Medikamentenapplikation, nicht moglich. Gerade weil zeitkritische bzw. unmittelbar lebensbedrohliche Einsatzsituationen selten sind, erscheint ein erganzendes und moglichst realitatsnahes Training zu ihrer Beherrschung unverzichtbar. Abstract Preclinical pediatric emergencies present with challenging situations. The present study involved the spectrum and frequency of invasive measures during pediatric emergencies; it also includes a framework of individual training and continuing education of non-pediatric emergency doctors. A retrospective assessment of medical emergency call protocols (2009-2014) of patients up until their fourteenth year of age in the emergency call location Bad Oeynhausen (district Minden-Lubbecke). The percentage of pediatric emergencies in the overall emergency call operations was 3.4% (n=321). Of these, 22.7% were infants (0-1 years of age), 36.6% small children (2-6 years of age), and 40.8% school-aged children (7-14 years of age). The spectrum involved predominantly respiratory disturbances (20.9%), neurological cases (30.8%), and trauma (28.3%). Up until the sixth year of age, acute illnesses accounted for the majority of cases, and injuries predominated in the age group of older children. 64.4% of the patients were treated with medication, and in 5.9% of the patients, a reposition was applied. Intubation (1.2%) and reanimation (0.9%) were rare. An intravenous needle was used in 34.4% of the cases. During an emergency call duty, preclinical pediatric emergencies, and the associated measures necessary to deal with them are relatively rare; however, this should not be a reason for an emergency doctor to be left unprepared. Without proper clinical preparation in the form of training or continuing education, particularly in respiratory and trauma management, and medication application, it is impossible to acquire proper skills; hence, a simulation training is of great importance."
Effect of Bankart repair on the loss of range of motion and the instability of the shoulder joint for recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation,JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY,"Background: Bankart repair postoperative complications include loss of shoulder motion and shoulder instability. The primary reason that postoperative complications develop may be excessive imbrication of the anterior band of the inferior glenohumeral ligament (AIGHL) or inadequate repair position. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the influence of inadequate repair by computer simulation for a normal shoulder joint. Methods: Magnetic resonance images of 10 normal shoulder joints were acquired for 7 positions every 30 degrees from the maximum internal rotation to the maximum external rotation with the arm abducted at 90 degrees. The shortest 3-dimensional path of the AIGHL in each rotational orientation was calculated. We used computer simulations to anticipate the loss of motion and instability by changing the AIGHL length and insertion sites on the glenoid. Results: The AIGHL length measured 50 +/- 5 mm at the maximum external shoulder rotation. AIGHL shortening by 3, 6, and 9 mm made the angle of maximum external rotation 80 degrees, 68 degrees, and 54 degrees, respectively. A superior deviation of 3, 6, and 9 mm on the glenoid insertion resulted in a maximum external rotation angle of 85 degrees, 79 degrees, and 77 degrees. An inferior deviation of 3, 6, and 9 mm produced humeral head translation of 1.7, 2.9, and 3.6 mm. Conclusion: Simulation of both excessive imbrication and deviation of the insertion position led to quantitative prediction of the resulting loss of motion and instability. These findings will be useful for anticipating complications after Bankart repair. (C) 2014 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees."
A GEE approach to determine sample size for pre- and post-intervention experiments with dropout,COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS,"Pre- and post-intervention experiments are widely used in medical and social behavioral studies, where each subject is supposed to contribute a pair of observations. In this paper we investigate sample size requirement for a scenario frequently encountered by practitioners: all enrolled subjects participate in the pre-intervention phase of study, but some of them will drop out due to various reasons, thus resulting in missing values in the post-intervention measurements. Traditional sample size calculation based on McNemar's test could not accommodate missing data. Through the GEE approach, we derive a closed-form sample size formula that properly accounts for the impact of partial observations. We demonstrate that when there are no missing data, the proposed sample size estimate under the GEE approach is very close to that under McNemar's test. When there are missing data, the proposed method can lead to substantial saving in sample size. Simulation studies and an example are presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
VALIDATION OF A QUICK MODELING PROGRAM GENERATING CLEARANCE ESTIMATES AT STEADY-STATE FOR ROUTINE THERAPEUTIC DRUG-MONITORING,THERAPEUTIC DRUG MONITORING,"Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of chronic treatments is justified for several reasons, including relative over- or underdosage due to variable individual elimination, pharmacokinetic interactions in drug combinations, and noncompliance. In all these circumstances, the prescribing physician is interested in having an estimation of the patient's clearance of the drug, even from one measurement. We compare a validated bayesian program, USC*Pack of Jelliffe, found difficult to use in daily routine, with a ''home-made'' program. The latter, which is capable of taking data from a clinical database, will generate a graphic simulation of daily plasma drug concentrations together with an estimation of steady-state clearance more rapidly than does USC*Pack. Both programs were run with only one measured plasma level. The patients were 83 children or young adults treated with phenobarbital (PB), carbamazepine (CBZ), and/or Valproic acid (VPA) who were resistant to monotherapy and who were to be sampled two to four times between doses. Drugs were routinely assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Despite the rough character of Phacile (numeric integration and adjustment of only two of three parameters, without an acknowledged minimization algorithm), the results are comparable to those obtained with USC*Pack for estimating clearance and predicting plasma drug concentrations. Phaciie algorithm, although simple, has proven of interest in routine TDM and as an introduction for medical students to the bayesian approach of population pharmacokinetics."
A training system for ultrasound-guided needle insertion procedures,"MEDICAL IMAGE COMPUTING AND COMPUTER-ASSISTED INTERVENTION - MICCAI 2007, PT 1, PROCEEDINGS","Needle placement into a patient body under guidance of ultrasound is a frequently performed procedure in clinical practice. Safe and successful performance of such procedure requires a high level of spatial reasoning and hand-eye co-ordination skills, which must be developed through intensive practice. In this paper we present a training system designed to improve the skills of interventional radiology trainees in ultrasound-guided needle placement procedures. Key issues involved in the system include surface and volumetric registration, solid texture modelling, spatial calibration, and real-time synthesis and rendering of ultrasound images. Moreover, soft tissue deformation caused by the needle movement and needle cutting is realised using a mass-spring-model approach. These have led to a realistic ultrasound simulation system, which has been shown to be a useful tool for the training of needle insertion procedures. Preliminary results of a construct evaluation study indicate the effectiveness and usefulness of the developed training system."
Coupled Genome-Wide DNA Methylation and Transcription Analysis Identified Rich Biomarkers and Drug Targets in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,CANCERS,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has poor clinical prognosis. Lack of TNBC-specific biomarkers prevents active clinical intervention. We reasoned that TNBC must have its specific signature due to the lack of three key receptors to distinguish TNBC from other types of breast cancer. We also reasoned that coupling methylation and gene expression as a single unit may increase the specificity for the detected TNBC signatures. We further reasoned that choosing the proper controls may be critical to increasing the sensitivity to identify TNBC-specific signatures. Furthermore, we also considered that specific drugs could target the detected TNBC-specific signatures. We developed a system to identify potential TNBC signatures. It consisted of (1) coupling methylation and expression changes in TNBC to identify the methylation-regulated signature genes for TNBC; (2) using TPBC (triple-positive breast cancer) as the control to detect TNBC-specific signature genes; (3) searching in the drug database to identify those targeting TNBC signature genes. Using this system, we identified 114 genes with both altered methylation and expression, and 356 existing drugs targeting 10 of the 114 genes. Through docking and molecular dynamics simulation, we determined the structural basis between sapropterin, a drug used in the treatment of tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency, and PTGS2, a TNBC signature gene involved in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. Our study reveals the existence of rich TNBC-specific signatures, and many can be drug target and biomarker candidates for clinical applications."
Advanced Methods for Dose and Regimen Finding During Drug Development: Summary of the EMA/EFPIA Workshop on Dose Finding (London 4-5 December 2014),CPT-PHARMACOMETRICS & SYSTEMS PHARMACOLOGY,"Inadequate dose selection for confirmatory trials is currently still one of the most challenging issues in drug development, as illustrated by high rates of late-stage attritions in clinical development and postmarketing commitments required by regulatory institutions. In an effort to shift the current paradigm in dose and regimen selection and highlight the availability and usefulness of well-established and regulatory-acceptable methods, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in collaboration with the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries Association (EFPIA) hosted a multistakeholder workshop on dose finding (London 4-5 December 2014). Some methodologies that could constitute a toolkit for drug developers and regulators were presented. These methods are described in the present report: they include five advanced methods for data analysis (empirical regression models, pharmacometrics models, quantitative systems pharmacology models, MCP-Mod, and model averaging) and three methods for study design optimization (Fisher information matrix (FIM)-based methods, clinical trial simulations, and adaptive studies). Pairwise comparisons were also discussed during the workshop; however, mostly for historical reasons. This paper discusses the added value and limitations of these methods as well as challenges for their implementation. Some applications in different therapeutic areas are also summarized, in line with the discussions at the workshop. There was agreement at the workshop on the fact that selection of dose for phase III is an estimation problem and should not be addressed via hypothesis testing. Dose selection for phase III trials should be informed by well-designed dosefinding studies; however, the specific choice of method(s) will depend on several aspects and it is not possible to recommend a generalized decision tree. There are many valuable methods available, the methods are not mutually exclusive, and they should be used in conjunction to ensure a scientifically rigorous understanding of the dosing rationale."
Composite sequential Monte Carlo test for post-market vaccine safety surveillance,STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,"Group sequential hypothesis testing is now widely used to analyze prospective data. If Monte Carlo simulation is used to construct the signaling threshold, the challenge is how to manage the type I error probability for each one of the multiple tests without losing control on the overall significance level. This paper introduces a valid method for a true management of the alpha spending at each one of a sequence of Monte Carlo tests. The method also enables the use of a sequential simulation strategy for each Monte Carlo test, which is useful for saving computational execution time. Thus, the proposed procedure allows for sequential Monte Carlo test in sequential analysis, and this is the reason that it is called composite sequential' test. An upper bound for the potential power losses from the proposed method is deduced. The composite sequential design is illustrated through an application for post-market vaccine safety surveillance data. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
An ultra-high speed whole slide image viewing system,ANALYTICAL CELLULAR PATHOLOGY,"Background: One of the goals for a Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) system is implementation in the clinical practice of pathology. One of the unresolved problems in accomplishing this goal is the speed of the entire process, i.e., from viewing the slides through making the final diagnosis. Most users are not satisfied with the correct viewing speeds of available systems. We have evaluated a new WSI viewing station and tool that focuses on speed. Method: A prototype WSI viewer based on PlayStation (R) 3 with wireless controllers was evaluated at the Department of Pathology at MGH for the following reasons: 1. For the simulation of signing-out cases; 2. Enabling discussion at a consensus conference; and 3. Use at slide seminars during a Continuing Medical Education course. Results: Pathologists were being able to use the system comfortably after 0-15 min training. There were no complaints regarding speed. Most pathologists were satisfied with the functionality, usability and speed of the system. The most difficult situation was simulating diagnostic sign-out. Conclusions: The preliminary results of adapting the Sony PlayStation (R) 3 (PS3 (R)) as an ultra-high speed WSI viewing system were promising. The achieved speed is consistent with what would be needed to use WSI in daily practice."
Evaluation of a novel scoring and grading model for VP-based exams in postgraduate nurse education,NURSE EDUCATION TODAY,"For Virtual Patient-based exams, several scoring and grading methods have been proposed, but none have yet been validated. The aim of this study was to evaluate a new scoring and grading model for VP-based exams in postgraduate paediatric nurse education. The same student group of 19 students performed a VP-based exam in three consecutive courses. When using the scoring and grading assessment model, which contains a deduction system for unnecessary or unwanted actions, a progression was found in the three courses: 53% of the students passed the first exam, 63% the second and 84% passed the final exam. The most common reason for deduction of points was due to students asking too many interview questions or ordering too many laboratory tests. The results showed that the new scoring model made it possible to judge the students' clinical reasoning process as well as their progress. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Problem-Based Learning Research in Anesthesia Teaching: Current Status and Future Perspective,ANESTHESIOLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE,"The teaching curriculum in anesthesia involves traditional teaching methods like topic-based didactic lectures, seminars, and journal clubs; intraoperative apprenticeship; and problem-based learning (PBL) and simulation. The advantages of incorporating PBL in anesthesia teaching include development of skills like clinical reasoning, critical thinking, and self-directed learning; in addition it also helps in developing a broader perspective of case scenarios. The present paper discusses the characteristics, key elements, and goals of PBL; various PBL methods available; lacunae in the existing knowledge of PBL research; its current status and future perspectives in anesthesia teaching."
Investigation of energy weighting using an energy discriminating photon counting detector for breast CT,MEDICAL PHYSICS,"Purpose: Breast CT is an emerging imaging technique that can portray the breast in 3D and improve visualization of important diagnostic features. Early clinical studies have suggested that breast CT has sufficient spatial and contrast resolution for accurate detection of masses and microcalcifications in the breast, reducing structural overlap that is often a limiting factor in reading mammographic images. For a number of reasons, image quality in breast CT may be improved by use of an energy resolving photon counting detector. In this study, the authors investigate the improvements in image quality obtained when using energy weighting with an energy resolving photon counting detector as compared to that with a conventional energy integrating detector. Methods: Using computer simulation, realistic CT images of multiple breast phantoms were generated. The simulation modeled a prototype breast CT system using an amorphous silicon (a-Si), CsI based energy integrating detector with different x-ray spectra, and a hypothetical, ideal CZT based photon counting detector with capability of energy discrimination. Three biological signals of interest were modeled as spherical lesions and inserted into breast phantoms; hydroxyapatite (HA) to represent microcalcification, infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC), and iodine enhanced infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IIDC). Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of these three lesions was measured from the CT reconstructions. In addition, a psychophysical study was conducted to evaluate observer performance in detecting microcalcifications embedded into a realistic anthropomorphic breast phantom. Results: In the energy range tested, improvements in SNR with a photon counting detector using energy weighting was higher (than the energy integrating detector method) by 30%-63% and 4%-34%, for HA and IDC lesions and 12%-30% (with Al filtration) and 32%-38% (with Ce filtration) for the IIDC lesion, respectively. The average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for detection of microcalcifications was higher by greater than 19% (for the different energy weighting methods tested) as compared to the AUC obtained with an energy integrating detector. Conclusions: This study showed that breast CT with a CZT photon counting detector using energy weighting can provide improvements in pixel SNR, and detectability of microcalcifications as compared to that with a conventional energy integrating detector. Since a number of degrading physical factors were not modeled into the photon counting detector, this improvement should be considered as an upper bound on achievable performance.

Cognitive debiasing 2: impediments to and strategies for change,BMJ QUALITY & SAFETY,"In a companion paper, we proposed that cognitive debiasing is a skill essential in developing sound clinical reasoning to mitigate the incidence of diagnostic failure. We reviewed the origins of cognitive biases and some proposed mechanisms for how debiasing processes might work. In this paper, we first outline a general schema of how cognitive change occurs and the constraints that may apply. We review a variety of individual factors, many of them biases themselves, which may be impediments to change. We then examine the major strategies that have been developed in the social sciences and in medicine to achieve cognitive and affective debiasing, including the important concept of forcing functions. The abundance and rich variety of approaches that exist in the literature and in individual clinical domains illustrate the difficulties inherent in achieving cognitive change, and also the need for such interventions. Ongoing cognitive debiasing is arguably the most important feature of the critical thinker and the well-calibrated mind. We outline three groups of suggested interventions going forward: educational strategies, workplace strategies and forcing functions. We stress the importance of ambient and contextual influences on the quality of individual decision making and the need to address factors known to impair calibration of the decision maker. We also emphasise the importance of introducing these concepts and corollary development of training in critical thinking in the undergraduate level in medical education."
Confidence intervals for a random-effects meta-analysis based on Bartlett-type corrections,STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,"In medical meta-analysis, the DerSimonian-Laird confidence interval for the average treatment effect has been widely adopted in practice. However, it is well known that its coverage probability (the probability that the interval actually includes the true value) can be substantially below the target level. One particular reason is that the validity of the confidence interval depends on the assumption that the number of synthesized studies is sufficiently large. In typical medical meta-analyses, the number of studies is fewer than 20. In this article, we developed three confidence intervals for improving coverage properties, based on (i) the Bartlett corrected likelihood ratio statistic, (ii) the efficient score statistic, and (iii) the Bartlett-type adjusted efficient score statistic. The Bartlett and Bartlett-type corrections improve the large sample approximations for the likelihood ratio and efficient score statistics. Through numerical evaluations by simulations, these confidence intervals demonstrated better coverage properties than the existing methods. In particular, with a moderate number of synthesized studies, the Bartlett and Bartlett-type corrected confidence intervals performed well.

A FEW THOUGHTS ON THE HISTORY OF EPILEPSY,SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL,"The history of epilepsy is a saga of the struggle by which scientific understanding of an unusual disease was gained by a long and circuitous route. In the beginning this affliction was attributed to demon possession and defied understanding for centuries when it was still regarded as a sacred disease and surrounded by superstition and mysticism; therapy of necessity had to follow similar lines of reasoning. The gradual realisation that cerebral dysfunction was the cause of this disease was highly significant although still followed by misunderstanding and misinterpretation - those two essential steps to progress. Clear, inspired reasoning and lucid clinical descriptions of epilepsy by John Hughlings Jackson and William Cowers set the scene for what was to follow. Experimental neurophysiology, cortical simulation, cortical localisation, new technologies of electro-encephalography, modes of visualisation of structures histologically and radiologically led to our present-day concepts of this complex disorder. We have been brought to new thresholds of understanding through the co-operative exertions of many workers from all parts of the world and this saga tells of some of the highest scientific accomplishments in medicine."
Education scholarship in emergency medicine part 2: supporting and developing scholars,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE,"Emergency medicine (EM) is defined, in part, by clinical excellence across an immense breadth of content and the provision of exemplary bedside teaching to a wide variety of learners. The specialty is also well-suited to a number of emerging areas of education scholarship, particularly in relation to team-based learning, clinical reasoning, acute care response, and simulation-based teaching. The success of EM education scholarship will be predicated on systematic, collective attention to providing the infrastructure for this to occur. Specifically, as a new generation of emergency physicians prepares for education careers, academic organizations need to develop means not only to identify potential scholars but also to mentor, support, and encourage their careers. This paper summarizes the supporting literature and presents related recommendations from a 2013 consensus conference on EM education scholarship led by the Academic Section of the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians."
The effectiveness of humane teaching methods in veterinary education,ALTEX-ALTERNATIVEN ZU TIEREXPERIMENTEN,"Animal use resulting in harm or death has historically played an integral role in veterinary education, in disciplines such as surgery, physiology, biochemistry, anatomy, pharmacology, and parasitology. However many non-harmful alternatives now exist, including computer simulations, high quality videos, ethically-sourced cadavers, such as from animals euthanased for medical reasons, preserved specimens, models and surgical simulators, non-invasive self-experimentation, and supervised clinical experiences. Veterinary students seeking to use such methods often face strong opposition from faculty members, who usually cite concerns about their teaching efficacy. Consequently, studies of veterinary students were reviewed comparing learning outcomes generated by non-harmful teaching methods with those achieved by harmful animal use. Of eleven published from 1989 to 2006, nine assessed surgical training - historically the discipline involving greatest harmful animal use. 45.5% (5111) demonstrated superior learning outcomes using more humane alternatives. Another 45.5% (5111) demonstrated equivalent learning outcomes, and 9.1 % (1/11) demonstrated inferior learning outcomes. Twenty one studies of non-veterinary students in related academic disciplines were also published from 1968 to 2004. 38.1% (8121) demonstrated superior 52.4% (11/21) demonstrated equivalent, and 9.5% (2121) demonstrated inferior learning outcomes using humane alternatives. Twenty nine papers in which comparison with harmful animal use did not occur illustrated additional benefits of humane teaching methods in veterinary education, including: time and cost savings, enhanced potential for customisation and repeatability of the learning exercise, increased student confidence and satisfaction, increased compliance with animal use legislation, elimination of objections to the use of purpose-killed animals, and integration of clinical perspectives and ethics early in the curriculum. The evidence demonstrates that veterinary educators can best serve their students and animals, while minimising financial and time burdens, by introducing well-designed teaching methods not reliant on harmful animal use."
Effects of sleep hours and fatigue on performance in laparoscopic surgery simulators,SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES,"Studies on a virtual reality simulator have demonstrated that sleep-deprived residents make more errors. Work-hour restrictions were implemented, among other reasons, to ensure enough sleep time for residents. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of sleep time, perceived fatigue, and experience on surgical performance. We hypothesized that performance would decrease with less sleep and fatigue, and that experienced surgeons would perform better than less experienced surgeons despite sleep deprivation and fatigue. Twenty-two surgical residents and attendings performed a peg transfer task on two simulators: the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Skills (FLS) trainer and the Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Surgical Trainer (VBLaSTA (c)), a virtual version of the FLS. Participants also completed questionnaires to assess their fatigue level and recent sleep hours. Each subject performed ten trials on each simulator in a counterbalanced order. Performance was measured using the FLS normalized scores and analyzed using a multiple regression model. The multiple regression analysis showed that sleep hours and perceived fatigue were not covariates. No correlation was found between experience level and sleep hours or fatigue. Sleep hours and fatigue did not appear to affect performance. Expertise level was the only significant determinant of performance in both FLS and VBLaSTA (c). Restricting resident work hours was expected to result in less fatigue and better clinical performance. In our study, peg transfer task performance was not affected by sleep hours. Experience level was a significant indicator of performance. Further examination of the complex relationship between sleep hour, fatigue, and clinical performance is needed to support the practice of work-hour restriction for surgical residents."
Pharmacometric Models for Characterizing the Pharmacokinetics of Orally Inhaled Drugs,AAPS JOURNAL,"During the last decades, the importance of modeling and simulation in clinical drug development, with the goal to qualitatively and quantitatively assess and understand mechanisms of pharmacokinetic processes, has strongly increased. However, this increase could not equally be observed for orally inhaled drugs. The objectives of this review are to understand the reasons for this gap and to demonstrate the opportunities that mathematical modeling of pharmacokinetics of orally inhaled drugs offers. To achieve these objectives, this review (i) discusses pulmonary physiological processes and their impact on the pharmacokinetics after drug inhalation, (ii) provides a comprehensive overview of published pharmacokinetic models, (iii) categorizes these models into physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) and (clinical data-derived) empirical models, (iv) explores both their (mechanistic) plausibility, and (v) addresses critical aspects of different pharmacometric approaches pertinent for drug inhalation. In summary, pulmonary deposition, dissolution, and absorption are highly complex processes and may represent the major challenge for modeling and simulation of PK after oral drug inhalation. Challenges in relating systemic pharmacokinetics with pulmonary efficacy may be another factor contributing to the limited number of existing pharmacokinetic models for orally inhaled drugs. Investigations comprising in vitro experiments, clinical studies, and more sophisticated mathematical approaches are considered to be necessary for elucidating these highly complex pulmonary processes. With this additional knowledge, the PBPK approach might gain additional attractiveness. Currently, (semi-) mechanistic modeling offers an alternative to generate and investigate hypotheses and to more mechanistically understand the pulmonary and systemic pharmacokinetics after oral drug inhalation including the impact of pulmonary diseases."
"FT-IR, Raman, RRS Measurements and DFT Calculation for Doxorubicin",MICROSCOPY RESEARCH AND TECHNIQUE,"Doxorubicin (DOXO) is a powerful anthracycline antibiotic used to treat many human neoplasms, including acute leukemias, lymphomas, stomach, breast and ovarian cancer, and bone tumors, yet causing cardiotoxicity at the same time. For this reason, there is a great interest in medical field to gain deep insight and knowledge of this molecule. Raman, Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) absorption spectroscopy, and Resonance Raman scattering were performed for the vibrational characterization of DOXO molecule. Density function theorem (DFT) modeling of Raman and FT-IR spectra were used for the assignment of the vibrational frequencies. The optimized molecular structured was obtained, first, on the basis of potential energy distribution. The simulation for vibrational bands is based on the calculations for internal force constants and potential energy distribution matrices. The calculated DOXO vibrational bands show qualitative agreement with the experimental observations (FT-IR absorption and Raman scattering). Microsc. Res. Tech. 73:991-995, 2010.

Habenular Stimulation for Neurosurgery Resistant Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Case Report,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,"Background Some patients suffer from persistent and severely disabling Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) symptoms that cannot be alleviated by conventional treatments or neuroablative interventions targeting cortico-striatal loop circuits. Currently, it is unclear how to manage the clinical symptoms of these unique patients. We reasoned that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the habenula (HB) could be a valuable subsequent treatment option for these otherwise medically intractable cases of severe OCD. The HB is an epithalamic structure critically involved in the encoding and responding to aversive stimulus events, cognitive and brain processes known to be impaired in many patients with OCD. Similarly, HB DBS can alleviate depression and anxiety, which often co-occur with OCD. Here, we explore the clinical benefits and risks of HB DBS treatment in a patient with severe and refractory OCD. Case Presentation A 30-year-old male patient presented with persistent and severely disabling OCD symptoms that were refractory to previous psychological and pharmacological treatments as well as to neuroablative surgical interventions involving both capsulotomy and cingulotomy. After HB DBS, however, the severity of the patient's OCD symptoms was markedly reduced at 1-month follow-up, which was sustained until the final (at 12-month) follow-up. The patient also reported enduring improvements in depression, anxiety, and health-related quality of life after several months of HB DBS treatment. Conclusions This case report provides the first clinical evidence suggesting that HB DBS could serve as a safe and effective alternative neurosurgical intervention for severe and refractory OCD. The present findings are promising and warrant further research into the role of the HB in pathophysiology and treatment of OCD."
Choice of futility boundaries for group sequential designs with two endpoints,BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY,"Background: In clinical trials, the opportunity for an early stop during an interim analysis (either for efficacy or for futility) may relevantly save time and financial resources. This is especially important, if the planning assumptions required for power calculation are based on a low level of evidence. For example, when including two primary endpoints in the confirmatory analysis, the power of the trial depends on the effects of both endpoints and on their correlation. Assessing the feasibility of such a trial is therefore difficult, as the number of parameter assumptions to be correctly specified is large. For this reason, so-called 'group sequential designs' are of particular importance in this setting. Whereas the choice of adequate boundaries to stop a trial early for efficacy has been broadly discussed in the literature, the choice of optimal futility boundaries has not been investigated so far, although this may have serious consequences with respect to performance characteristics. Methods: In this work, we propose a general method to construct 'optimal' futility boundaries according to predefined criteria. Further, we present three different group sequential designs for two endpoints applying these futility boundaries. Our methods are illustrated by a real clinical trial example and by Monte-Carlo simulations. Results: By construction, the provided method of choosing futility boundaries maximizes the probability to correctly stop in case of small or opposite effects while limiting the power loss and the probability of stopping the study 'wrongly'. Our results clearly demonstrate the benefit of using such 'optimal' futility boundaries, especially compared to futility boundaries commonly applied in practice. Conclusions: As the properties of futility boundaries are often not considered in practice and unfavorably chosen futility boundaries may imply bad properties of the study design, we recommend assessing the performance of these boundaries according to the criteria proposed in here."
How Clinicians Perceive Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Technologies in Diagnostic Decision Making: Mixed Methods Approach,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,"Background: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and related technologies, AI algorithms are being embedded into various health information technologies that assist clinicians in clinical decision making. Objective: This study aimed to explore how clinicians perceive AI assistance in diagnostic decision making and suggest the paths forward for AI-human teaming for clinical decision making in health care. Methods: This study used a mixed methods approach, utilizing hierarchical linear modeling and sentiment analysis through natural language understanding techniques. Results: A total of 114 clinicians participated in online simulation surveys in 2020 and 2021. These clinicians studied family medicine and used AI algorithms to aid in patient diagnosis. Their overall sentiment toward AI-assisted diagnosis was positive and comparable with diagnoses made without the assistance of AI. However, AI-guided decision making was not congruent with the way clinicians typically made decisions in diagnosing illnesses. In a quantitative survey, clinicians reported perceiving current AI assistance as not likely to enhance diagnostic capability and negatively influenced their overall performance (beta=-0.421, P=.02). Instead, clinicians' diagnostic capabilities tended to be associated with well-known parameters, such as education, age, and daily habit of technology use on social media platforms. Conclusions: This study elucidated clinicians' current perceptions and sentiments toward AI-enabled diagnosis. Although the sentiment was positive, the current form of AI assistance may not be linked with efficient decision making, as AI algorithms are not well aligned with subjective human reasoning in clinical diagnosis. Developers and policy makers in health could gather behavioral data from clinicians in various disciplines to help align AI algorithms with the unique subjective patterns of reasoning that humans employ in clinical diagnosis."
Critical Thinking Skills of RNs: Exploring Demographic Determinants,JOURNAL OF CONTINUING EDUCATION IN NURSING,"Background: Previous studies of nurses' critical thinking skills that included demographic characteristics as determinants have been inconclusive. This study explored demographic determinants of critical thinking skills among nurses from public hospitals in Peninsular Malaysia. Method: This cross-sectional study included 549 nurses recruited via multistage cluster sampling. Nurses completed the demographic questionnaire and Health Sciences Reasoning Test (HSRT). Results: The majority of respondents failed to demonstrate critical thinking skills with a mean overall HSRT score of 13.8 (SD = 3.4). Educational qualifications (p = .003) and clinical specialties (p = .022) were significantly related to nurses' critical thinking skills. Years of clinical experience, age, and job ranking were not significant. Conclusion: The findings indicate a need to address the present curriculum in nursing education and to reinforce critical thinking skills in the nursing workforce. Future research on how nurses in Malaysia acquire critical thinking skills is needed."
Detection of endotracheal tube obstruction by analysis of the expiratory flow signal,INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE,"Objective: Acute obstruction of endotracheal tubes (ETT) increases airway pressure, decreases tidal volume, increases the risk of dynamic :hyperinflation by prolonging the duration of passive expiration, and prevents reliable calculation of tracheal pressure. We propose a computer-assisted method for detecting ETT obstruction during controlled mechanical ventilation. The method only requires measurement of; the expiratory flow. Design: Computer simulation; prospective study in two cases; retrospective study in one case and in seven patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Setting: Laboratory of the Section of Experimental Anaesthesiology (University of Freiburg); surgical adult intensive care units in a university hospital (University of Basel) and in a university affiliated hospital (Zentralklinikum Augsburg). Patients: 3 patients with partial ETT or bronchial obstructions and 7 ARDS patients, Measurements and results: Expiratory flow was measured using a pneumotachograph and integrated to obtain expiratory volume. The time-constant of passive expiration (tau(E)) as a function of expired volume [tau(E)(V-E) function] was calculated from the expiratory volume/flow curve. We investigated the tau(E)(V-E) function of data obtained from: (1) computer simulation of mechanically ventilated homogeneous and inhomogeneous lungs intubated with ETTs of different sizes; (2) one patient with an artificial ETT obstruction of 7.5 and 25 % of the cross-sectional area of the ETT (case 1); (3) one patient with ETT obstruction due to secretions (case 2); (4) one patient with acute bronchial constriction (case 3); (5) seven ARDS patients who showed an increase in airway resistance of more than 2 cm H2O.s/l. It was found that an ETT obstruction caused an increase in tau(E) in early expiration (at high flow), whereas tau(E) in late expiration was virtually unchanged. The reason for this is the flow dependency of the increase in ETT resistance produced by ETT obstruction. Unlike ETT obstruction, an increase in pure airway resistance produced an increase in tau(E) throughout expiration. Conclusions: An ETT obstruction can be reliably distinguished from an increase in pure airway resistance by a characteristic pattern change in the tau(E)(V-E) function, which can be detected easily even by an automated pattern recognition system."
Advanced life support cardiac arrest scenario test evaluation,RESUSCITATION,"Background: The cardiac arrest scenario test (CASTest) is a central component of the assessment strategy on the Advanced Life Support Course. The aim of this study was to establish equivalence between the four different CASTest scenarios and investigate the impact of profession, candidate order and course centre on the pass rate. Materials and methods: This was a cluster randomised study. CASTest scenarios were randomly allocated to candidates stratified by course centre. Candidate demographics and performance were recorded on the criterion referenced check list along with the final assessment outcome (pass/fail). Differences in pass rates according scenario; profession, course centre and candidate order were examined by Chi-squared and multiple logistic regression. Results: Two thousand, four hundred and forty-nine assessments from 65 course centres were evaluated. There was no difference in pass rate between scenarios (average pass rate 74.4%). Pass rates according to course centre varied widely (40-93%, P < 0.0001) as did professional group (42-100%, P < 0.0001). The order that candidates took the test did not influence the pass rate. Conclusion: The CASTest assessment scenarios used during ALS testing appear equivalent in terms of difficulty. In contrast, the professional background of the candidate and centre at which the assessment is performed do significantly influence the likelihood of passing the assessment. Further evaluation of the reasons for differences between course centres is required. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
ESR1 ligand-binding domain mutations in hormone-resistant breast cancer,NATURE GENETICS,"Seventy percent of breast cancers express estrogen receptor (ER), and most of these are sensitive to ER inhibition. However, many such tumors for unknown reasons become refractory to inhibition of estrogen action in the metastatic setting. We conducted a comprehensive genetic analysis of two independent cohorts of metastatic ER-positive breast tumors and identified mutations in ESR1 affecting the ligand-binding domain (LBD) in 14 of 80 cases. These included highly recurrent mutations encoding p.Tyr537Ser, p.Tyr537Asn and p.Asp538Gly alterations. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the structures of the Tyr537Ser and Asp538Gly mutants involve hydrogen bonding of the mutant amino acids with Asp351, thus favoring the agonist conformation of the receptor. Consistent with this model, mutant receptors drive ER-dependent transcription and proliferation in the absence of hormone and reduce the efficacy of ER antagonists. These data implicate LBD-mutant forms of ER in mediating clinical resistance to hormonal therapy and suggest that more potent ER antagonists may be of substantial therapeutic benefit."
Contextual information influences diagnosis accuracy and decision making in simulated emergency medicine emergencies,BMJ QUALITY & SAFETY,"Background It is well documented that adaptations in cognitive processes with increasing skill levels support decision making in multiple domains. We examined skill-based differences in cognitive processes in emergency medicine physicians, and whether performance was significantly influenced by the removal of contextual information related to a patient's medical history. Method Skilled (n=9) and less skilled (n=9) emergency medicine physicians responded to high-fidelity simulated scenarios under high-and low-context information conditions. Results Skilled physicians demonstrated higher diagnostic accuracy irrespective of condition, and were less affected by the removal of contextspecific information compared with less skilled physicians. The skilled physicians generated more options, and selected better quality options during diagnostic reasoning compared with less skilled counterparts. These cognitive processes were active irrespective of the level of contextspecific information presented, although highcontext information enhanced understanding of the patients' symptoms resulting in higher diagnostic accuracy. Conclusions Our findings have implications for scenario design and the manipulation of contextual information during simulation training."
The debate on hysteria.,REVUE NEUROLOGIQUE,"The debate on hysteria at the Societe de Neurologie in 1908 signed the official death certificate for Charcot's hysteria, which even in his day had started to come under attack. The article by Babinski in 1901 had delivered the coup de grace. The debate paints an astonishing picture of the medical world of the day, and also of hysteria, which would never again present the spectacular clinical picture seen up to that point Babinski, dominating the debate with his strong personality, prevented a discussion on the menial basis for hysteria, requested by several participants, in favour of pithiatism, which in his view offered an acceptable definition of hysteria. It is surprising that more was not made of the contradiction in terms in the expression auto-suggestion: and of the fact that Babinski was begging the question when he asserted that it could not be asserted that a patient had been subject to suggestion! This debate effectively banished hysteria from the columns of the neurological press, whose pages it had tended to overburden. it cannot however be blamed for not having made a positive contribution to our understanding of this neurosis which, even today, remains enigmatic. It does our Society credit to have ruled out for ethical reasons the hypothesis of simulation."
Virtual supersampling as post-processing step preserves the trabecular bone morphometry in human peripheral quantitative computed tomography scans,PLOS ONE,"In the clinical field of diagnosis and monitoring of bone diseases, high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is an important imaging modality. It provides a resolution where quantitative bone morphometry can be extracted in vivo on patients. It is known that HR-pQCT provides slight differences in morphometric indices compared to the current standard approach micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). The most obvious reason for this is the restriction of the radiation dose and with this a lower image resolution. With advances in micro-CT evaluation techniques such as patient-specific remodeling simulations or dynamic bone morphometry, a higher image resolution would potentially also allow the application of such novel evaluation techniques to clinical HR-pQCT measurements. Virtual supersampling as post-processing step was considered to increase the image resolution of HR-pQCT scans. The hypothesis was that this technique preserves the structural bone morphometry. Supersampling from 82 mu m to virtual 41 mu m by trilinear interpolation of the grayscale values of 42 human cadaveric forearms resulted in strong correlations of structural parameters (R-2: 0.96-1.00). BV/TV was slightly overestimated (4.3%, R-2: 1.00) compared to the HR-pQCT resolution. Tb.N was overestimated (7.47%; R-2: 0.99) and Tb.Th was slightly underestimated (-4.20%; R-2: 0.98). The technique was reproducible with PE yocv between 1.96% (SMI) and 7.88% (Conn.D). In a clinical setting with 205 human forearms with or without fracture measured at 82 mu m resolution HR-pQCT, the technique was sensitive to changes between groups in all parameters (p < 0.05) except trabecular thickness. In conclusion, we demonstrated that supersampling preserves the bone morphometry from HR-pQCT scans and is reproducible and sensitive to changes between groups. Super-sampling can be used to investigate on the resolution dependency of HR-pQCT images and gain more insight into this imaging modality."
Progressive Autonomy in the Era of Increased Supervision,JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME,"The observation of decreased resident autonomy, ultimately influencing the readiness of a new graduate to practice, has been supported with a number of recent surveys. This perceived lack of autonomy is felt to be due, in part, to many reasons, including duty-hour regulations, increased supervision requirements, patient safety measures, concern for complication rates, and other performance measures. Pressure on faculty members to have increased clinical productivity may not allow for more resident autonomy. Increased clinical exposure to improve resident independence may come from several suggested areas. First, restructuring the residency program to allow for more clinical time may be one way to improve education. Second, increased use of surgical simulation will allow for more experience to develop technical skills within a controlled environment. Surgical simulators can be used to acquire new skills and also as a means of assessing competence. Third, competency-based education (CBE) has been offered as a way to improve resident education. At its core, CBE offers criterion-based assessments for residents and faculty that allow for more frequent feedback."
VALIDATION OF NUMERICAL APPROACHES FOR ELECTROMAGNETIC CHARACTERIZATION OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE RADIOFREQUENCY COILS,PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH M,"Numerical methods based on solutions of Maxwell's equations are usually adopted for the electromagnetic characterization of Magnetic Resonance (MR) Radiofrequency (RF) coils. In this context, many different numerical methods can be employed, including time domain methods, e.g., the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD), and frequency domain methods, e.g., the Finite Element Methods (FEM) and the Method of Moments (MoM). We provide a quantitative comparison of performances and a detailed evaluation of advantages and limitations of the aforementioned methods in the context of RF coil design for MR applications. Specifically, we analyzed three RF coils which are representative of current geometries for clinical applications: a 1.5 T proton surface coil; a 7 T dual tuned surface coil; a 7 T proton volume coil. The numerical simulation results have been compared with measurements, with excellent agreement in almost every case. However, the three methods differ in terms of required computing resources (memory and simulation time) as well as their ability to handle a realistic phantom model. For this reason, this work could provide a guide to select the most suitable method for each specific research and clinical applications at low and high field."
Cost-Effectiveness of Cinacalcet Hydrochloride for Hemodialysis Patients With Severe Secondary Hyperparathyroidism in Japan,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF KIDNEY DISEASES,"Background: Cinacalcet effectively reduces elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), even those with severe disease for whom parathyroidectomy can be the treatment of choice. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of cinacalcet treatment in hemodialysis patients with severe SHPT in Japan. Study Design: Cost-effectiveness analysis. Setting & Population: Patients with severe SHPT (intact PTH >500 pg/mL) who were receiving hemodialysis in Japan. Model, Perspective,& Timeframe: A Markov model was constructed from the health care system perspective in Japan. Patients were followed up over their lifetime. Dialysis costs were not included in the base case. Intervention: Cinacalcet as an addition to conventional treatment compared to conventional treatment alone. In both arms, patients underwent parathyroidectomy if intact PTH level was >500 pg/mL for 6 months and they were eligible for surgery. Outcomes: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results: ICERs for cinacalcet for those who were eligible for surgery and those who were not were $352,631/QALY gained and $21,613/QALY gained, respectively. Sensitivity and scenario analyses showed that results were fairly robust to variations in model parameters and assumptions. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, cinacalcet was cost-effective in only 0.9% of simulations for those eligible for surgery, but in more than 99.9% of simulations for those ineligible for surgery, if society would be willing to pay $50,000 per additional QALY. Limitations: Data for the long-term effect of cinacalcet on patient-level outcomes are limited. The model predicted rates for clinical events using data for the surrogate biochemical end points. Conclusions: The use of cinacalcet to treat severe SHPT is likely to be cost-effective for only those who cannot undergo parathyroid surgery for medical or personal reasons.

Evaluating Surgical Residents' Patient-Centered Communication Skills: Practical Alternatives to the Apprenticeship Model,JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION,"OBJECTIVES: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) requires residency programs to assess communication skills and provide feedback to residents. We aimed to develop a feasible data collection process that generates objective clinical performance information to guide training activities, inform ACGME milestone evaluations, and validate assessment instruments. DESIGN: Residents care for patients in the surgical clinic and in the hospital, and participate in a communication curriculum providing practice with standardized patients (SPs). We measured perception of resident communication using the 14-item Communication Assessment Tool (CAT), collecting data from patients at the surgery clinic and surgical wards in the hospital, and from SP encounters during simulated training scenarios. We developed a handout of CAT example behaviors to guide patients completing the communication assessment. SETTING: Independent academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: General surgery residents. RESULTS: The primary outcome is the percentage of total items patients rated excellent; we collected data on 24 of 25 residents. Outpatient evaluations resulted in significantly higher scores (mean 84.5% vs. 68.6%, p < 0.001), and female patients provided nearly statistically significantly higher ratings (mean 85.2% vs. 76.7%, p = 0.084). In multivariate analysis, after controlling for patient gender, visit reason, and race, (1) residents' CAT scores from SPs in simulation were independently associated with communication assessments in their concurrent patient population (p = 0.017), and (2) receiving CAT example instructions was associated with a lower percentage of excellent ratings by 9.3% (p = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: Our data collection process provides a model for obtaining meaningful information about resident communication proficiency. CAT evaluations of surgical residents by the inpatient population had not previously been described in the literature; our results provide important insight into relationships between the evaluations provided by inpatients, clinic patients, and SPs in simulation. Our example behaviors guide shows promise for addressing a common concern, minimizing ceiling effects when measuring physician-patient communication.

Using Artificial Intelligence and Gaming to Improve New Nurse Transition,NURSE LEADER,"New nurses transitioning to practice must develop clinical reasoning skills enabling safe patient care delivery. Time and exposure necessary to develop expert-situated cognition present a challenge for new nurses. Educational interventions have been proposed as solutions in a complex, cognitively and emotionally demanding environment. Artificial intelligence technology may provide innovative approaches to influence cognitive development. Preliminary pilot study data evaluating virtual reality (VR) simulation education for new nurses recognizing and responding to respiratory decline in hospitalized infants are remarkable. Data suggest that new nurse learners are responsive and receptive to VR education, and VR training may be more effective than traditional teaching modalities in some situations."

Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships of the anthracycline anticancer drugs,CLINICAL PHARMACOKINETICS,"The anthracycline glycoside antibiotics represent a group of potent anticancer agents with a wide spectrum of activity against solid tumours and haematological malignancies, and are the mainstay of a large number of clinical protocols for the treatment of adult and childhood neoplastic diseases. Their clinical activity is limited, however, by acute and chronic adverse effects. Myelosuppression, predominantly neutropenia and leucopenia, is the dose-limiting toxicity: in addition to this, mucositis, nausea, vomiting and alopecia are frequent, whereas hepatopathy, characterised by elevated bilirubin concentrations, occurs less frequently. Cardiotoxicity is a major adverse effect of the anthracycline antibiotics and can be acute or chronic; in the acute setting, electrocardiographic abnormalities may be seen, including ST-T elevations and arrhythmias, but chronic cardiotoxicity represents a serious adverse effect that may be lethal due to the development of irreversible, cumulative dose-dependent, congestive cardiomyopathy. The occurrence of toxicity displays a marked interindividual variation, and for this reason the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anthracyclines have been extensively investigated in order to identify integrated models that can be used in the clinical setting to prevent the development of serious toxicity, mainly leucopenia, and maximise tumour exposure. Pharmacokinetics has been recognised to influence both the toxicity and the activity of anthracyclines; in particular, there is increasing evidence that the mode of administration plays an important role for cumulative cardiotoxicity and data indicate that bolus administration, rather than continuous infusion, appears to be an important risk factor for anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. thus implying that this type of toxicity is maximum concentration-dependent. On the contrary. exposure to the drug, as measured by area under the curve, seems best related to the occurrence of leucopenia. Finally. the development of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models allows the simulation of drug effects and ultimately dose optimisation in order to anticipate important toxicities and prevent their occurrence by the administration of prophylactic treatments."
Smoking Cessation and the Internet: A Qualitative Method Examining Online Consumer Behavior,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,"Background: Smoking is a major preventable cause of disease and disability around the world. Smoking cessation support including information, discussion groups, cognitive behavioral treatment, and self-help materials - can be delivered via the Internet. There is limited information about the reasons and methods consumers access smoking cessation information on the Internet. Objectives: This study aims to determine the feasibility of a method to examine the online behavior of consumers seeking smoking cessation resources. In particular, we sought to identify the reasons and methods consumers use to access and assess the quality of these resources. Methods: Thirteen participants were recruited via the state-based Quit (R) smoking cessation campaign, operated by the Victorian Cancer Council, in December 2001. Online behavior was evaluated using semi-structured interviews and Internet simulations where participants sought smoking cessation information and addressed set-case scenarios. Online interaction was tracked through pervasive logging with specialist software. Results: Thirteen semi-structured interviews and 4 Internet simulations were conducted in January 2002. Participants sought online smoking cessation resources for reasons of convenience, timeliness, and anonymity - and because their current information needs were unmet. They employed simple search strategies and could not always find information in an efficient manner. Participants employed several different strategies to assess the quality of online health resources. Conclusions: Consumer online behavior can be studied using a combination of survey, observation, and online surveillance. However, further qualitative and observational research is required to harness the full potential of the Internet to deliver public health resources."
Dependent censoring in piecewise exponential survival models,STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH,"There are often reasons to suppose that there is dependence between the time to event and time to censoring, or dependent censoring, for survival data, particularly when considering medical data. This is because the decision to treat or not is often made according to prognosis, usually with the most ill patients being prioritised. Due to identifiability issues, sensitivity analyses are often used to assess whether independent censoring can lead to misleading results. In this paper, a sensitivity analysis method for piecewise exponential survival models is presented. This method assesses the sensitivity of the results of standard survival models to small amounts of dependence between the time to failure and time to censoring variables. It uses the same assumption about the dependence between the time to failure and time to censoring as previous sensitivity analyses for both standard parametric survival models and the Cox model. However, the method presented in this paper allows the use of more flexible models for the marginal distributions whilst remaining computationally simple. A simulation study is used to assess the accuracy of the sensitivity analysis method and identify the situations in which it is suitable to use this method. The study found that the sensitivity analysis performs well in many situations, but not when the data have a high proportion of censoring."
A robust TDT-type association test under informative parental missingness,STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,"Many family-based association tests rely on the random transmission of alleles from parents to offspring. Among them, the transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) may be considered to be the most popular statistical test. The TDT statistic and its variations were proposed to evaluate nonrandom transmission of alleles from parents to the diseased children. However, in family studies, parental genotypes may be missing due to parental death, loss, divorce, or other reasons. Under some missingness conditions, nonrandom transmission of alleles may still occur even when the gene and disease are not associated. As a consequence, the usual TDT-type tests would produce excessive false positive conclusions in association studies. In this paper, we propose a novel TDT-type association test which is not only simple in computation but also robust to the joint effect of population stratification and informative parental missingness. Our test is model-free and allows for different mechanisms of parental missingness across subpopulations. We use a simulation study to compare the performance of the new test with TDT and point out the advantage of the new method. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
Regularized approach for data missing not at random,STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH,"It is common in longitudinal studies that missing data occur due to subjects' no response, missed visits, dropout, death or other reasons during the course of study. To perform valid analysis in this setting, data missing not at random (MNAR) have to be considered. However, models for data MNAR often suffer from the identifiability issue and hence result in difficulty in estimation and computational convergence. To ameliorate this issue, we propose the LASSO and ridge-regularized selection models that regularize the missing data mechanism model to handle data MNAR, with the regularization parameter selected via a cross-validation procedure. The proposed models can be also employed for sensitivity analysis to examine the effects on inference of different assumptions about the missing data mechanism. We illustrate the performance of the proposed models via simulation studies and the analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial."
Bipolar Electrogram Shannon Entropy at Sites of Rotational Activation Implications for Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation,CIRCULATION-ARRHYTHMIA AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY,"Background- The pivot is critical to rotors postulated to maintain atrial fibrillation (AF). We reasoned that wavefronts circling the pivot should broaden the amplitude distribution of bipolar electrograms because of directional information encoded in these signals. We aimed to determine whether Shannon entropy (ShEn), a measure of signal amplitude distribution, could differentiate the pivot from surrounding peripheral regions and thereby assist clinical rotor mapping. Methods and Results- Bipolar electrogram recordings were studied in 4 systems: (1) computer simulations of rotors in a 2-dimensional atrial sheet; (2) isolated rat atria recorded with a multi-electrode array (n=12); (3) epicardial plaque recordings of induced AF in hypertensive sheep (n=11); and (4) persistent AF patients (n=10). In the model systems, rotation episodes were identified, and ShEn calculated as an index of amplitude distribution. In humans, ShEn distribution was analyzed at AF termination sites and with respect to complex fractionated electrogram mean. We analyzed rotation episodes in simulations (4 cycles) and animals (rats: 14 rotors, duration 80 +/- 81 cycles; sheep: 13 rotors, 4.2 +/- 1.5 cycles). The maximum ShEn bipole was consistently colocated with the pivot zone. ShEn was negatively associated with distance from the pivot zone in simulated spiral waves, rats, and sheep. ShEn was modestly inversely associated with complex fractionated electrogram; however, there was no relationship at the sites of highest ShEn. Conclusions- ShEn is a mechanistically based tool that may assist AF rotor mapping."
Ethics education to support ethical competence learning in healthcare: an integrative systematic review,BMC MEDICAL ETHICS,"Background Ethical problems in everyday healthcare work emerge for many reasons and constitute threats to ethical values. If these threats are not managed appropriately, there is a risk that the patient may be inflicted with moral harm or injury, while healthcare professionals are at risk of feeling moral distress. Therefore, it is essential to support the learning and development of ethical competencies among healthcare professionals and students. The aim of this study was to explore the available literature regarding ethics education that promotes ethical competence learning for healthcare professionals and students undergoing training in healthcare professions. Methods In this integrative systematic review, literature was searched within the PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycInfo databases using the search terms 'health personnel', 'students', 'ethics', 'moral', 'simulation', and 'teaching'. In total, 40 articles were selected for review. These articles included professionals from various healthcare professions and students who trained in these professions as subjects. The articles described participation in various forms of ethics education. Data were extracted and synthesised using thematic analysis. Results The review identified the need for support to make ethical competence learning possible, which in the long run was considered to promote the ability to manage ethical problems. Ethical competence learning was found to be helpful to healthcare professionals and students in drawing attention to ethical problems that they were not previously aware of. Dealing with ethical problems is primarily about reasoning about what is right and in the patient's best interests, along with making decisions about what needs to be done in a specific situation. Conclusions The review identified different designs and course content for ethics education to support ethical competence learning. The findings could be used to develop healthcare professionals' and students' readiness and capabilities to recognise as well as to respond appropriately to ethically problematic work situations."
MioLab: Simulator for cardiac myocyte contractile force of rat based on the dynamics of calcium,MEDICAL ENGINEERING & PHYSICS,"Background: The calcium ion (Ca2+) is essential in cardiac electrical activity since it is the direct activator of myofilaments, which cause contraction. For this reason, irregular Ca2+ flow in the cardiac myocyte is one of the main causes of cardiac arrhythmias and contractile dysfunction. In this sense, the formulation of mathematical and computational models of the mammalian ventricular myocyte has played an important role in understanding cardiac physiology. This paper proposes a biophysical model for the rat cardiac myocyte in order to reduce the number of degrees of freedom and provides a mathematical framework that makes computation simpler for our understanding of the complex process of excitation-contraction-relaxation (ECR), uses low-order lumped parameter of the myofilaments and Ca2+ handling. The model allows the calculation of contractile force mainly based on the dynamics of Ca2+, provides data on transient Ca2+ and enables the analysis of the effects of drugs used in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. Methods: The mathematical model which describes the kinetics of cytosolic Ca2+ and dynamic cross-bridges, was implemented through nine differential equations, auxiliary equations, three 47 biophysical parameters. Each was implemented using C++ programming and its user-friendly interface in the programming language Delphi. The results of each simulation were stored in a text file and its analysis was shown in a graphical interface using executable programs in Matlab (R). Additionally, the validation model was performed by comparing both the experimental data of Ca2+ transient and several drug tests. Results: The model satisfactorily reproduced the Ca2+ transient, as well as the effects of drugs that cause beta-adrenergic stimulation and the inhibition of the Ca2+ uptake mechanism (SERCA). Changes in the parameters regulating Ca2+ entry through L-type channels produced the oscillation amplitude of the Ca2+ transient known as the syndrome of pulses alternans. Changes in parameters related to the Na+-Ca2+ exchange has already stabilized the transient Ca2+ and produced a decrease in amplitude of the contractile force. Conclusion: The simulator proved to be a tool to study and understand the mechanisms that involve the kinetics of Ca2+ and the dynamics of cross-bridges in the unit heart muscle, as well as a tool to analyze the possible factors that may cause arrhythmias and study the effects of drugs that are used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases in general.

Cue Recognition by Undergraduate Nursing Students: An Integrative Review,JOURNAL OF NURSING EDUCATION,"Patients express multiple cues, ranging from subtle to overt. Clinical cues may signal changes or the presence of stability in the patient's condition. Little is known about the number and types of cues recognized by beginning nurses. This article reports the results of an integrative review of the literature published between 1964 and 2013 concerning recognition of clinical cues by undergraduate nursing students. Search terms included cue, cue recognition, clinical cue, and clinical reasoning. Twenty-seven studies met inclusion criteria. Initial evidence exists of differences in cue recognition between novice and expert nurses. Influences on cue recognition include familiarity with the patient or the patient's health condition. Cue recognition does not necessarily predict presence or quality of nursing actions. International research concerning cue recognition by nurses is in its infancy. Opportunities exist to further the science through use of rigorous design and multisite sampling."
Interpretation of the pinched point position in human skin memristor measurements,EMBEC & NBC 2017,"It is shown that human skin acts like a memristor but systematic studies on skin memristance are not published, yet. If e.g., a low frequency voltage is applied to human skin and the current is measured, a hysteresis loop can be seen in the voltage-current plot. In skin measurements, the pinched point of the hysteresis loop can be shifted from the coordinate origin. In this paper, possible reasons for this observation shall be investigated and interpreted by the use of simulation. Two example measurements on human skin are presented, as well."
Data Modelling for Visual Entities to Streamline Virtual Patient Re-purposing in Virtual Reality,"MOBILITY FOR SMART CITIES AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT - CHALLENGES FOR HIGHER EDUCATION (ICL2021), VOL 2","Virtual patient cases are interactive, scenario-based simulations of real-world healthcare incidents. When applied in an educational context, they have been found to improve clinical reasoning, procedural and team skills. Many healthcare education institutions have allocated considerable resources to design and develop virtual patient cases. The challenges to integrate virtual patients into the curriculum along with their maintenance costs have highlighted the necessity for representing the cases in ready-to-repurpose formats. Legacy, text-based virtual patient cases consist of nodes, where the case script unfolds descriptively, and links, that lets the learner select different pathways to manage a health condition by means of evidence-based decisions. These cases could be transformed into virtual reality world scenarios and offer the learner a more realistic experience. In this paper we revisit the established model of typical virtual patient cases by enriching their nodes and links with data structures allowing them to be adapted to extended reality environments."
Sequential parallel comparison design for gold standard noninferiority trials with a prespecified margin,BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL,"Three-arm noninferiority trials (involving an experimental treatment, a reference treatment, and a placebo)-called the gold standard noninferiority trials-are conducted in patients with mental disorders whenever feasible, but often fail to show superiority of the experimental treatment and/or the reference treatment over the placebo. One possible reason is that some of the patients receiving the placebo show apparent improvement in the clinical condition. An approach to addressing this problem is the use of the sequential parallel comparison design (SPCD). Nonetheless, the SPCD has not yet been discussed in relation to gold standard noninferiority trials. In this article, our aim was to develop a hypothesis-testing method and its corresponding sample size calculation method for gold standard noninferiority trials with the SPCD. In a simulation, we show that the proposed hypothesis-testing method achieves the nominal type I error rate and power and that the proposed sample size calculation method has adequate power accuracy."
A framework for making predictive models useful in practice,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,"Objective: To analyze the impact of factors in healthcare delivery on the net benefit of triggering an Advanced Care Planning (ACP) workflow based on predictions of 12-month mortality. Materials and Methods: We built a predictive model of 12-month mortality using electronic health record data and evaluated the impact of healthcare delivery factors on the net benefit of triggering an ACP workflow based on the models' predictions. Factors included nonclinical reasons that make ACP inappropriate: limited capacity for ACP, inability to follow up due to patient discharge, and availability of an outpatient workflow to follow up on missed cases. We also quantified the relative benefits of increasing capacity for inpatient ACP versus outpatient ACP. Results: Work capacity constraints and discharge timing can significantly reduce the net benefit of triggering the ACP workflow based on a model's predictions. However, the reduction can be mitigated by creating an outpatient ACP workflow. Given limited resources to either add capacity for inpatient ACP versus developing outpatient ACP capability, the latter is likely to provide more benefit to patient care. Discussion: The benefit of using a predictive model for identifying patients for interventions is highly dependent on the capacity to execute the workflow triggered by the model. We provide a framework for quantifying the impact of healthcare delivery factors and work capacity constraints on achieved benefit. Conclusion: An analysis of the sensitivity of the net benefit realized by a predictive model triggered clinical workflow to various healthcare delivery factors is necessary for making predictive models useful in practice."
Should Providers Give Women Advance Provision of Emergency Contraceptive Pills? A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,WOMENS HEALTH ISSUES,"Purpose: We sought to determine the potential effect and cost-effectiveness of different means of accessing emergency contraceptive pills (ECP) on unintended pregnancy rates in sexually active women. Methods: We used a computer simulation model to compare the effects of advance provision, on-demand provision, and no use of ECP on unintended pregnancies and costs of care in three hypothetical cohorts of 1 million sexually active women. Data on effectiveness of ECP from the single-use clinical trials, and costs from Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program were used for the model. Findings: Advance provision of ECP is projected to avert a greater or the same percentage of unintended pregnancies compared with on-demand provision, with the greatest percentage of pregnancies averted (66%) in low-risk women with advance provision. In the simulation model, the percentage of pregnancies averted decreases as the frequency of unprotected intercourse increases and ECP use decreases. In all scenarios, the cost-savings ratio-the number of dollars saved on averted pregnancy expenditures for each dollar spent on advance ECP-is greater than one. Conclusion: Advance provision of ECP has the potential to avert unintended pregnancies and reduce medical expenditures. The most likely reason that the advance provision trials fail to demonstrate reductions in pregnancy rates is a result of a combination of small study sizes, the use of ECP in both treatment and control groups, and a failure to take into account a realistic range of rates of unprotected intercourse and imperfect ECP use.

Diagnostic misclassification reduces the ability to detect linkage in inflammatory bowel disease genetic studies,GUT,"Background-Linkage data have now identified several inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) susceptibility loci but these data have not been consistently replicated in independent studies. One potential explanation for this is the possibility that patients enrolled in such studies may have been erroneously classified with respect to their diagnosis. Aims-To determine the rate and type of misclassification in a large population of individuals referred for participation in an IBD genetics study and to examine the effect of diagnostic misclassification on the power to detect linkage. Methods-The medical records of 1096 patients entered into an IBD genetics programme were reviewed using standardised diagnostic criteria. The original patient reported diagnoses were changed, if necessary, based on review, and the reasons for the change in diagnosis were recorded. To evaluate the effect of misclassification on linkage results, simulations were created with Gensim and analysed using Genehunter to evaluate a model for IBD inheritance. Results-Sixty eight of 1096 (6.2%) individuals had a change in diagnosis from that originally reported. The majority of changes were patients with either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis who were determined not to have IBD at all. The principal reasons for changes to the original diagnosis were discordance between the patients' subjective reports of diagnosis and actual clinical history, endoscopic, or pathological results; a change in disease pattern over time; and insufficient information available to confirm the original diagnosis. A 10% misclassification rate resulted in 28.4% and 40.2% loss of power to detect a true linkage when using a statistical model for a presumed IBD locus with lambda (s) values of 1.8 and 1.3, respectively. Conclusions-Diagnostic misclassification occurs in patients enrolled in IBD genetic studies and frequently involves assigning the diagnosis of IBD to nonaffected individuals. Even low rates of diagnostic misclassification can lead to significant loss of power to detect a true linkage, particularly for loci with modest effects as are likely to be found in IBD."
Tyrosine phosphorylation by Src within the cavity of the adenine nucleotide translocase 1 regulates ADP/ATP exchange in mitochondria,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-CELL PHYSIOLOGY,"Feng J, Lucchinetti E, Enkavi G, Wang Y, Gehrig P, Roschitzki B, Schaub MC, Tajkhorshid E, Zaugg K, Zaugg M. Tyrosine phosphorylation by Src within the cavity of the adenine nucleotide translocase 1 regulates ADP/ATP exchange in mitochondria. Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 298: C740-C748, 2010. First published December 9, 2009; doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00310.2009.-Phosphorylation of adenine nucleotide translocator 1 (ANT1) at residue Y194, which is part of the aromatic ladder located within the lumen of the carrier, critically regulates mitochondrial metabolism. Recent data support the concept that members of the Src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases are constitutively present in mitochondria and key to regulation of mitochondrial function. Herein, we demonstrate that site mutations of ANT1 (Y190 -> F190, Y194 -> F194) mimicking dephosphorylation of the aromatic ladder resulted in loss of oxidative growth and ADP/ATP exchange activity in respiration-incompetent yeast expressing mutant chimeric yN-hANT1. ANT1 is phosphorylated at Y194 by the Src family kinase members Src and Lck, and increased phosphorylation is tightly linked to reduced cell injury in preconditioned protected vs. unprotected cardiac mitochondria. Molecular dynamics simulations find the overall structure of the phosphorylated ANT1 stable, but with an increased steric flexibility in the region of the aromatic ladder, matrix loop m2, and four helix-linking regions. Combined with an analysis of the putative cytosolic salt bridge network, we reason that the effect of phosphorylation on transport is likely due to an accelerated transition between the main two conformational states (c <-> m) of the carrier during the transport cycle. Since aromatic signatures are typical for other mitochondrial carrier proteins with important biological functions, our results may be more general and applicable to these carriers."
A Semi-passive Planar Manipulandum for Upper-Extremity Rehabilitation,ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,"Robotic rehabilitation is a promising approach to treat individuals with neurological or orthopedic disorders. However, despite significant advancements in the field of rehabilitation robotics, this technology has found limited traction in clinical practice. A key reason for this issue is that most robots are expensive, bulky, and not scalable for in-home rehabilitation. Here, we introduce a semi-passive rehabilitation robot (SepaRRo) that uses controllable passive actuators (i.e., brakes) to provide controllable resistances at the end-effector over a large workspace in a manner that is cost-effective and safe for in-home use. We also validated the device through theoretical analyses, hardware experiments, and human subject experiments. We found that by including kinematic redundancies in the robot's linkages, the device was able to provide controllable resistances to purely resist the movement of the end-effector, or to gently steer (i.e., perturb) its motion away from the intended path. When testing these capabilities on human subjects, we found that many of the upper-extremity muscles could be selectively targeted based on the forcefield prescribed to the user. These results indicate that SepaRRo could serve as a low-cost therapeutic tool for upper-extremity rehabilitation; however, further testing is required to evaluate its therapeutic benefits in patient population."
A Dedicated Tomographic Image Reconstruction Algorithm for Integration-Mode Detector Configuration in Ion Imaging,2018 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM AND MEDICAL IMAGING CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS (NSS/MIC),"A dedicated tomographic image reconstruction algorithm for integration-mode detector configuration is proposed and investigated. The algorithm makes use of the stopping power and the model of the scattering power for the entire histogram of Water Equivalent Thickness (WET) components. Therefore, compared to conventional tomographic image reconstruction of the WET component with maximum occurrence along straight trajectories, this algorithm is expected to provide better image quality. An anthropomorphic phantom, adopted as ground truth, is used to simulate the proton trajectories. The system matrix of the proposed algorithm is based on the statistical estimation of the integral scattering power for each WET as a 2D Gaussian distribution according to a multiple Coulomb scattering model. The 2D Gaussian distributions are normalized to the unit, thus forming a 3D distribution, namely the cone, for each WET. The cones are interpolated to each integration line, thus matching the image. The updating formula of the simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique is modified to account for the entire histogram of the WET components. For computational reasons, the tomographic image reconstruction is implemented relying on ordered subsets of projection angles. In general, better convergence is obtained for the dedicated algorithm, thus showing extremely reduced noise break-up. The results indicate the potential of the proposed algorithm to provide better image quality than conventional tomographic image reconstruction. Future studies will include the application of the proposed algorithm to Monte Carlo simulations of clinical ion imaging and a deeper image quality assessment."
Phase space generation for Proton and carbon ion Beams for external Users' applications at the heidelberg ion Therapy center,FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY,"In the field of radiation therapy, accurate and robust dose calculation is required. For this purpose, precise modeling of the irradiation system and reliable computational platforms are needed. At the Heidelberg Ion Therapy Center (HIT), the beamline has been already modeled in the FLUKA Monte Carlo (MC) code. However, this model was kept confidential for disclosure reasons and was not available for any external team. The main goal of this study was to create efficiently phase space (PS) files for proton and carbon ion beams, for all energies and foci available at HIT. PSs are representing the characteristics of each particle recorded (charge, mass, energy, coordinates, direction cosines, generation) at a certain position along the beam path. In order to achieve this goal, keeping a reasonable data size but maintaining the requested accuracy for the calculation, we developed a new approach of beam PS generation with the MC code FLUKA. The generated PSs were obtained using an infinitely narrow beam and recording the desired quantities after the last element of the beamline, with a discrimination of primaries or secondaries. In this way, a unique PS can be used for each energy to accommodate the different foci by combining the narrow-beam scenario with a random sampling of its theoretical Gaussian beam in vacuum. PS can also reproduce the different patterns from the delivery system, when properly combined with the beam scanning information. MC simulations using PS have been compared to simulations, including the full beamline geometry and have been found in very good agreement for several cases (depth dose distributions, lateral dose profiles), with relative dose differences below 0.5%. This approach has also been compared with measured data of ion beams with different energies and foci, resulting in a very satisfactory agreement. Hence, the proposed approach was able to fulfill the different requirements and has demonstrated its capability for application to clinical treatment fields. It also offers a powerful tool to perform investigations on the contribution of primary and secondary particles produced in the beamline. These PSs are already made available to external teams upon request, to support interpretation of their measurements."
"Evaluating cognitive ability, knowledge tests and situational judgement tests for postgraduate selection",MEDICAL EDUCATION,"OBJECTIVES This study aimed to evaluate the validity and utility of and candidate reactions towards cognitive ability tests, and current selection methods, including a clinical problem-solving test (CPST) and a situational judgement test (SJT), for postgraduate selection. METHODS This was an exploratory, longitudinal study to evaluate the validities of two cognitive ability tests (measuring general intelligence) compared with current selection tests, including a CPST and an SJT, in predicting performance at a subsequent selection centre (SC). Candidate reactions were evaluated immediately after test administration to examine face validity. Data were collected from candidates applying for entry into training in UK general practice (GP) during the 2009 recruitment process. Participants were junior doctors (n = 260). The mean age of participants was 30.9 years and 53.1% were female. Outcome measures were participants' scores on three job simulation exercises at the SC. RESULTS Findings indicate that all tests measure overlapping constructs. Both the CPST and SJT independently predicted more variance than the cognitive ability test measuring non-verbal mental ability. The other cognitive ability test (measuring verbal, numerical and diagrammatic reasoning) had a predictive value similar to that of the CPST and added significant incremental validity in predicting performance on job simulations in an SC. The best single predictor of performance at the SC was the SJT. Candidate reactions were more positive towards the CPST and SJT than the cognitive ability tests. CONCLUSIONS In terms of operational validity and candidate acceptance, the combination of the current CPST and SJT proved to be the most effective administration of tests in predicting selection outcomes. In terms of construct validity, the SJT measures procedural knowledge in addition to aspects of declarative knowledge and fluid abilities and is the best single predictor of performance in the SC. Further research should consider the validity of the tests in this study in predicting subsequent performance in training."
Reducing voxel bleed in hadamard-encoded MRI and MRS,MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE,"The point spread function (PSF) of Hadamard encoding deviates from its ideal profile due to practical (as opposed to intrinsic) reasons. Finite radiofrequency (RF) pulse length and gradient strength cause slice profile imperfections that lead to cross-talk (voxel bleed) as large as 17% for a 1-KHz bandwidth, 5.12-ms RF pulse under 3 mT/m. This could adversely affect localization and quantification, and consequently clinical usefulness. A simple modification of the Hadamard RF pulse synthesis that exploits its unique ability to encode noncontiguous slices is proposed and shown to markedly improve the PSF. Computer simulation, in vitro and in vivo experiments confirm the theoretical derivation of voxel bleed reduction from similar to 17% to below 5% per Hadamard-encoded direction."
Effect of Weightlessness on the 3D Structure Formation and Physiologic Function of Human Cancer Cells,BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL,"With the rapid development of modern medical technology and the deterioration of living environments, cancer, the most important disease that threatens human health, has attracted increasing concerns. Although remarkable achievements have been made in tumor research during the past several decades, a series of problems such as tumor metastasis and drug resistance still need to be solved. Recently, relevant physiological changes during space exploration have attracted much attention. Thus, space exploration might provide some inspiration for cancer research. Using on ground different methods in order to simulate microgravity, structure and function of cancer cells undergo many unique changes, such as cell aggregation to form 3D spheroids, cell-cycle inhibition, and changes in migration ability and apoptosis. Although numerous better experiments have been conducted on this subject, the results are not consistent. The reason might be that different methods for simulation have been used, including clinostats, random positioning machine (RPM) and rotating wall vessel (RWV) and so on. Therefore, we review the relevant research and try to explain novel mechanisms underlying tumor cell changes under weightlessness."
Quantitative modeling of the accuracy in registering preoperative patient-specific anatomic models into left atrial cardiac ablation procedures,MEDICAL PHYSICS,"Purpose: In cardiac ablation therapy, accurate anatomic guidance is necessary to create effective tissue lesions for elimination of left atrial fibrillation. While fluoroscopy, ultrasound, and electroanatomic maps are important guidance tools, they lack information regarding detailed patient anatomy which can be obtained from high resolution imaging techniques. For this reason, there has been significant effort in incorporating detailed, patient-specific models generated from preoperative imaging datasets into the procedure. Both clinical and animal studies have investigated registration and targeting accuracy when using preoperative models; however, the effect of various error sources on registration accuracy has not been quantitatively evaluated. Methods: Data from phantom, canine, and patient studies are used to model and evaluate registration accuracy. In the phantom studies, data are collected using a magnetically tracked catheter on a static phantom model. Monte Carlo simulation studies were run to evaluate both baseline errors as well as the effect of different sources of error that would be present in a dynamic in vivo setting. Error is simulated by varying the variance parameters on the landmark fiducial, physical target, and surface point locations in the phantom simulation studies. In vivo validation studies were undertaken in six canines in which metal clips were placed in the left atrium to serve as ground truth points. A small clinical evaluation was completed in three patients. Landmark-based and combined landmark and surface-based registration algorithms were evaluated in all studies. In the phantom and canine studies, both target registration error and point-to-surface error are used to assess accuracy. In the patient studies, no ground truth is available and registration accuracy is quantified using point-to-surface error only. Results: The phantom simulation studies demonstrated that combined landmark and surface-based registration improved landmark-only registration provided the noise in the surface points is not excessively high. Increased variability on the landmark fiducials resulted in increased registration errors; however, refinement of the initial landmark registration by the surface-based algorithm can compensate for small initial misalignments. The surface-based registration algorithm is quite robust to noise on the surface points and continues to improve landmark registration even at high levels of noise on the surface points. Both the canine and patient studies also demonstrate that combined landmark and surface registration has lower errors than landmark registration alone. Conclusions: In this work, we describe a model for evaluating the impact of noise variability on the input parameters of a registration algorithm in the context of cardiac ablation therapy. The model can be used to predict both registration error as well as assess which inputs have the largest effect on registration accuracy. (C) 2014 American Association of Physicists in Medicine."
Bayesian analysis of longitudinal quality of life measures with informative missing data using a selection model,STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH,"Health-related quality of life consists of multi-dimensional measurements of physical and mental health domains. Health-related quality of life is often followed up to evaluate efficacy of treatments in clinical studies. During the follow-up period, a missing data problem inevitably arises. When missing data occur for reasons related to poor health-related quality of life, a complete-case only analysis can lead to invalid inferences. We propose a Bayesian approach to analyze longitudinal moderate to high-dimensional multivariate outcome data in the presence of non-ignorable missing data. To account for non-ignorable missing data, we employ a selection model for the joint likelihood factorization where we apply Bayesian spike and slab variable selection in the missing data mechanism to detect informative factors among multiple outcomes. We model the relationship between multiple outcomes and covariates using linear mixed effects models where multiple outcome correlations are captured by a hierarchical structure. We conduct simulation studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed method compared with the conventional last observation carried forward approach. We use a motivating example that originates from a longitudinal study of quality of life in gastric cancer patients who underwent distal gastrectomy. In this application, we demonstrate that our proposed method can offer efficiency gain in the marginal associations and provide the associations between outcomes and the absence of patients' information."
Multicompartment modeling of protein shedding kinetics during vascularized tumor growth,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Identification of protein biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis remains a critical unmet clinical need. A major reason is that the dynamic relationship between proliferating and necrotic cell populations during vascularized tumor growth, and the associated extra- and intra-cellular protein outflux from these populations into blood circulation remains poorly understood. Complementary to experimental efforts, mathematical approaches have been employed to effectively simulate the kinetics of detectable surface proteins (e.g., CA-125) shed into the bloodstream. However, existing models can be difficult to tune and may be unable to capture the dynamics of non-extracellular proteins, such as those shed from necrotic and apoptosing cells. The models may also fail to account for intra-tumoral spatial and microenvironmental heterogeneity. We present a new multi-compartment model to simulate heterogeneously vascularized growing tumors and the corresponding protein outflux. Model parameters can be tuned from histology data, including relative vascular volume, mean vessel diameter, and distance from vasculature to necrotic tissue. The model enables evaluating the difference in shedding rates between extra- and non-extracellular proteins from viable and necrosing cells as a function of heterogeneous vascularization. Simulation results indicate that under certain conditions it is possible for non-extracellular proteins to have superior outflux relative to extracellular proteins. This work contributes towards the goal of cancer biomarker identification by enabling simulation of protein shedding kinetics based on tumor tissue-specific characteristics. Ultimately, we anticipate that models like the one introduced herein will enable examining origins and circulating dynamics of candidate biomarkers, thus facilitating marker selection for validation studies."
On testing simultaneously non-inferiority in two multiple primary endpoints and superiority in at least one of them,BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL,"In a clinical trial with an active treatment and a placebo the situation may occur that two (or even more) primary endpoints may be necessary to describe the active treatment's benefit. The focus of our interest is a more specific situation with two primary endpoints in which superiority in one of them would suffice given that non-inferiority is observed in the other. Several proposals exist in the literature for dealing with this or similar problems, but prove insufficient or inadequate at a closer look (e.g. Bloch et al. (2001, 2006) or Tamhane and Logan (2002, 2004)). For example, we were unable to find a good reason why a bootstrap p-value for superiority should depend on the initially selected non-inferiority margins or on the initially selected type I error a. We propose a hierarchical three step procedure, where non-inferiority in both variables must be proven in the first step, superiority has to be shown by a bivariate test (e.g. Holm (1979), O'Brien (1984), Hochberg (1988), a bootstrap (Wang (1998)), or Lduter (1996)) in the second step, and then superiority in at least one variable has to be verified in the third step by a corresponding univariate test. All statistical tests are performed at the same one-sided significance level ot. From the above mentioned bivariate superiority tests we preferred Lduter's SS test and the Holm procedure for the reason that these have been proven to control the type I error strictly, irrespective of the correlation structure among the primary variables and the sample size applied. A simulation study reveals that the performance regarding power of the bivariate test depends to a considerable degree on the correlation and on the magnitude of the expected effects of the two primary endpoints. Therefore, the recommendation of which test to choose depends on knowledge of the possible correlation between the two primary endpoints. In general, Lduter's SS procedure in step 2 shows the best overall properties, whereas Holm's procedure shows an advantage if both a positive correlation between the two variables and a considerable difference between their standardized effect sizes can be expected."
Secondary Breast Augmentation: Is There a Trend for Bigger Implants?,AESTHETIC PLASTIC SURGERY,"BackgroundDespite novel assessment tools and 3D simulation, patient's desire for implant size change is one of the most common reasons for revision surgery after primary breast augmentation. In this study, we analysed outcomes and predictive indicators for revision surgeries in a cohort of patients operated on by a single surgeon.Patients and MethodsAll consecutive patients who underwent revision augmentation surgery between 2013 and 2017 by the first author were included in this study. Besides review of medical records, subgroups based on the indication for revision surgery were compared and statistically analysed.ResultsA total of 110 patients were included in this study. Revision surgery was performed 97.2months on average after primary augmentation. Eighty-six per cent of patients received larger implants. Indications for revision surgery and associated subgroups were: (1) wish for bigger implants (38%), (2) complication+wish for bigger implants (26%), (3) complication (29%), (4) complication+wish for smaller implants (3%) and (5) wish for smaller implants (3%). Subgroup analysis showed that patients who underwent revision surgery for bigger implants were significantly younger compared to patients who suffered a complication or desired smaller implants. Time to secondary augmentation was significantly shorter in case of wish for size change compared to complications as reason for revision surgery. Implant sizes differed significantly in patients where volume change was the sole indication for surgery compared to revisions performed due to complications.ConclusionIn our cohort of patients, almost all patients who underwent revision surgery after primary breast augmentation received bigger implants. Patients who specifically wished for size change were younger, asked for surgery earlier and received larger volumes compared to patients who underwent revision surgery for other reasons.Level of Evidence IVThis journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

Role of Clinician Involvement in Patient Safety in Obstetrics and Gynecology,CLINICAL OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY,"Patient safety is a significant concern for healthcare providers. Involving physicians in clinical quality activities in obstetrics and gynecology can be difficult for many reasons including time demands, lack of knowledge of process improvement activities, or change fatigue due to failure of adequate implementation of previous activities. This overview for improving the culture of safety identifies roles physicians can play from participating in quality assessment and improvement activities, improving teamwork between disciplines, communicating effectively, creating departmental guidelines, and deciding on outcome measures for benchmarking. An improved culture of safety is better for our patients and may reduce malpractice exposure."
A critique of Stewart's approach: the chemical mechanism of dilutional acidosis,INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE,"While Stewart's acid-base approach is increasingly used in clinical practice, it has also led to new controversies. Acid-base disorders can be seen from different viewpoints: on the diagnostic/clinical, quantitative/mathematical, or the mechanistic level. In recent years, confusion in the interpretation and terminology of Stewart's approach has arisen from mixing these different levels. This will be demonstrated on the basis of a detailed analysis of the mechanism of dilutional acidosis. In the classical dilution concept, metabolic acidosis after resuscitation with large volumes is attributed to the dilution of serum bicarbonate. However, Stewart's approach rejects this explanation and offers an alternative one that is based on a decrease in a strong ion difference. This mechanistic explanation is questionable for principal chemical reasons. The objective of this study is to clarify the chemical mechanism of dilutional acidosis. Experimental data and simulations of various dilution experiments, as well as theoretical and chemical considerations were used. 1. The key to understanding the mechanism of dilutional acidosis lies in the open CO2/HCO3 (-)-buffer system where the buffer base (HCO3 (-)) is diluted whereas the buffer acid is not diluted (constant pCO(2)). 2. The categorization in independent and dependent variables depends on the system regarded. 3. Neither the principle of electroneutrality, nor a change in [SID], nor increased H2O dissociation plays a mechanistic role. Stewart's approach is valid at the mathematical level but does not provide any mechanistic insights. However, the quantification and categorization of acid-base disorders, using Stewart approach, may be helpful in clinical practice."
"Understanding the metabolism of the anticancer drug Triapine: electrochemical oxidation, microsomal incubation and in vivo analysis using LC-HRMS",ANALYST,"alpha-N-Heterocyclic thiosemicarbazones are among the most promising ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors identified so far. Triapine, the most prominent representative of this class of substances, has been investigated in multiple phase I and II clinical trials. With regard to clinical practice, Triapine showed activity against hematological diseases, but ineffectiveness against a variety of solid tumors. However, the reasons are still vague and the amount of ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) data for Triapine available in the literature is very limited. Therefore, different analytical tools were used to investigate the metabolism of Triapine including electrochemical oxidations, liver microsomes and in vivo samples from mice. The main metabolic reactions, observed by all three methods, were dehydrogenation and hydroxylations, confirming that electrochemistry, as a purely instrumental approach, can be applied for the simulation of metabolic pathways. The dehydrogenated metabolite M1 was identified as a thiadiazole ring-closed oxidation product of Triapine. From a biological point of view, M1, as a key metabolite, is of interest since the crucial chemical property of alpha-N-heterocyclic thiosemicarbazones to bind metal ions is lost and cytotoxicity studies showed no anticancer activity of M1. The in vivo data of the urine samples revealed very high levels of the metabolites and Triapine itself already 15 min after treatment. This clearly indicates that Triapine is rapidly metabolised and excreted, which represents an important step forward to understand the possible reason for the inefficiency of Triapine against solid tumors."
A novel multi-task linear mixed model for smartphone-based telemonitoring,EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS,"Telemonitoring is the use of electronic devices including smartphones to remotely monitor patients. Using predictive models, telemonitoring data can be translated into a clinical indicator of disease severity, thus allowing physicians to assess patient conditions more frequently and adjust treatment. This greatly complements conventional in-clinic medical examination that requires patients' physical presence in a specialized clinic, which is logistically inconvenient, costly, and far less frequent. The challenge, however, is the need for a patient specific predictive model to address patient heterogeneity. Training a patient-specific model suffers from small sample sizes. This can be potentially tackled by multi-task learning (MTL), which builds models for multiple related tasks (e.g., patients with the same disease) jointly to allow the models to borrow strength from each other. Existing MTL models do not suffice because they typically assume sample independence, but the samples in a telemonitoring application correspond to repeated measurements over time for the same patient that have an inherent correlation. This special data characteristic requires a linear mixed model (LMM), which has not been integrated with MTL in the existing literature. We propose a new Multi-task Linear Mixed Model (MultiLMM) model that integrates MTL and LMM in a single framework. Our methodological contributions include a mathematical formulation for MultiLMM, an efficient and converging algorithm for parameter estimation, and a theoretical analysis to reveal the reason why MultiLMM outperforms LMM by integrating the multi-task learning capability. Our simulation studies demonstrate better performance of MultiLMM than LMM under various scenarios. Finally, we present an application of using MultiLMM to predict the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), a clinical instrument for measuring PD severity, based on tapping signals collected by the mPower app installed on patients' smartphones. MultiLMM shows higher prediction accuracy than a collection of competing approaches under different training sample sizes."
A bio-impedance probe to assess liver steatosis during transplant surgery,2011 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC),"This work addresses the design of a bioimpedance probe to assess steatosis on the exposed liver in the donor during liver transplant surgery. Whereas typically bioimpedance uses needle probes to avoid surface effects, for clinical reasons a non-penetrative probe is required. In addition the need to ensure that the measurement is representative of the bulk tissue suggests a larger probe than is normally used to ensure a sufficiently large measurement volume. Using a simple model, simulations and tests on bovine liver, this paper investigates the relationship between probe dimensions and depth of measurement penetration and investigates the accuracy which might be expected in a configuration suitable for use in the operating theatre on intact but exposed livers. A probe using ECG electrodes is proposed and investigated."
A Bayesian natural cubic B-spline varying coefficient method for non-ignorable dropout,BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY,"Background Dropout is a common problem in longitudinal clinical trials and cohort studies, and is of particular concern when dropout occurs for reasons that may be related to the outcome of interest. This paper reviews common parametric models to account for dropout and introduces a Bayesian semi-parametric varying coefficient model for exponential family longitudinal data with non-ignorable dropout. Methods To demonstrate these methods, we present results from a simulation study and estimate the impact of drug use on longitudinal CD4(+)T cell count and viral load suppression in the Women's Interagency HIV Study. Sensitivity analyses are performed to consider the impact of model assumptions on inference. We compare results between our semi-parametric method and parametric models to account for dropout, including the conditional linear model and a parametric frailty model. We also compare results to analyses that fail to account for dropout. Results In simulation studies, we show that semi-parametric methods reduce bias and mean squared error when parametric model assumptions are violated. In analyses of the Women's Interagency HIV Study data, we find important differences in estimates of changes in CD4(+)T cell count over time in untreated subjects that report drug use between different models used to account for dropout. We find steeper declines over time using our semi-parametric model, which makes fewer assumptions, compared to parametric models. Failing to account for dropout or to meet parametric assumptions of models to account for dropout could lead to underestimation of the impact of hard drug use on CD4(+)cell count decline in untreated subjects. In analyses of subjects that initiated highly active anti-retroviral treatment, we find that the estimated probability of viral load suppression is lower in models that account for dropout. Conclusions Non-ignorable dropout is an important consideration when analyzing data from longitudinal clinical trials and cohort studies. While methods that account for non-ignorable dropout must make some unavoidable assumptions that cannot be verified from the observed data, many methods make additional parametric assumptions. If these assumptions are not met, inferences can be biased, making more flexible methods with minimal assumptions important."
Mathematical modeling of the impact of cytokine response of acute myeloid leukemia cells on patient prognosis,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease. One reason for the heterogeneity may originate from inter-individual differences in the responses of leukemic cells to endogenous cytokines. On the basis of mathematical modeling, computer simulations and patient data, we have provided evidence that cytokine-independent leukemic cell proliferation may be linked to early relapses and poor overall survival. Depending whether the model of cytokine-dependent or cytokine-independent leukemic cell proliferation fits to the clinical data, patients can be assigned to two groups that differ significantly with respect to overall survival. The modeling approach further enables us to identify parameter constellations that can explain unexpected responses of some patients to external cytokines such as blast crisis or remission without chemotherapy."
Elbow joint biomechanics for preclinical evaluation of total elbow prostheses,JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS,"Total elbow arthroplasty is a clinically successful procedure, yet long-term implant survival rates have historically lagged behind those reported for total hips and knees. Clinical complications associated with implant wear, osteolysis, stem loosening and device fracture have been implicated as reasons for limited long-term survivorship. Unfortunately, there is little published information on the biomechanics and method(s) for preclinical evaluation of total elbow prostheses that could provide insight into the mechanisms of failure. Additionally, there are no consensus testing standards or summaries of loading profiles of the humero-ulnar joint associated with a range of activities of daily living. Such data would facilitate the standardized preclinical assessment of total elbow devices such is commonplace for other large joints. The objective of the work here is therefore to provide a comprehensive review of elbow joint biomechanics as it relates to preclinical evaluation of total elbow implants. This summary includes a review of elbow joint forces, kinematics, the types and frequency of humero-ulnar joint motions associated with activities of daily living and clinical outcomes, as well as proposing a methodology for deriving humero-ulnar joint reaction force magnitudes and vector orientations as a function of a known mass/force at the hand. From these data, a scalable, bi-axial loading profile is proposed as a foundation for the development of clinically relevant, laboratory simulations for assessment of total elbow prostheses performance.

A supremum version of logrank test for detecting late occurring survival differences,COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS,"In many clinical trials, the investigator may have some reasons a priori to expect delayed or late occurring survival differences after some initial period of similar event occurrence. In such a case, the logrank test will place some undesired emphasis on the early period where differences are unlikely to occur. In this article, we propose to use the maximum of a sequence of standardized logrank statistics created after successively deleting events during the initial period. Calculation of the p-value for the proposed test statistic is based on the special covariance structure of the individual logrank statistics. Simulation results show that the proposed test is quite sensitive for detecting late occurring differences. The proposed method is also illustrated with a real example. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Effect of Adherence on Lifetime Fractures in Osteoporotic Women Treated With Daily and Weekly Bisphosphonates,JOURNAL OF BONE AND MINERAL RESEARCH,"Patients miss doses of their osteoporosis medications, or stop taking them altogether, for a variety of reasons. Whereas the reasons have been well-studied, their consequences, at the population level, have not. The goal of this study was to estimate the number of fractures that could be prevented with optimal adherence compared with usual adherence to daily and weekly bisphosphonates in the United States (US). We developed a simulation of adherence to bisphosphonate therapy in the US. The model samples women by age and BMD from nationally representative US distributions, and tracks them over time assuming they are treated with a daily or weekly bisphosphonate. The model simulates two adherence scenarios: usual adherence and optimal adherence. The differences in fracture rates between these scenarios, as well as the medication and fracture costs, are estimated with the model. Approximately 258 (95% interval, 194-324) lifetime fractures can be prevented with optimal adherence per 1,000 bisphosphonate-treated women. For optimal adherence, these results translate to an additional lifetime medication cost of $3,800 and a lifetime savings in fracture-related costs of $2,100, for an expected net cost of $1,700 (95% interval, -$4,100 to $3,300) per woman over her lifetime. These results suggest that in patients taking daily or weekly bisphosphonate therapy, a substantial number of fractures occur that are attributable to less than optimal adherence. These results show that there is implicit value to improving adherence, both from a financial and clinical perspective. J Bone Miner Res 2009;24:1819-1826.

Assessment of the clinical validity of an adjusted Marsh pharmacokinetic model using an effect-site rate constant (k(e0)) of 1.21 min(-1),SOUTHERN AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA,"Introduction: The first commercially available target-controlled infusion pump, the Diprifusor, employed a Marsh pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic parameter set, and this model (the Diprifusor-Marsh model) is also available in several of today's pumps. However, it is unsuited for effect-site, target-controlled infusions (C-e-TCI) because it assumes slow transfer between blood and the effect-site (k(e0) = 0.26 min(-1)). We hypothesised that a faster k(e0) of 1.21 min(-1) (Adjusted-Marsh model) for C-e-TCI would result in hypnotic effects equivalent to that of the Schnider parameter set (Schnider model). Methods: We replicated a previously published study that demonstrated the Diprifusor-Marsh model's unsuitability for C-e-TCI. We randomised 40 unpremedicated young adults into two groups to receive C-e-TCI, employing either the Schnider model or the Adjusted-Marsh model. We infused propofol at 3 000 mg.hour(-1), while running a pharmacokinetic simulation and recording the electroencephalographic bispectral index (BIS) electronically. At loss of consciousness (LOC), indicated by a syringe-drop, we converted the infusion to C-e-TCI, targeting the effect-site concentration (C-e) observed at LOC, for 20 minutes. We regarded a difference of 10 BIS-units as clinically important. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between the group medians regarding time-to-LOC, induction-dose, BIS at LOC and C-e-target. BIS decreased monotonically in both groups from a median of 78.5 at LOC to a steady-state median (25-27) at 15 minutes. The BIS of the Adjusted-Marsh model group closely followed the BIS of the Schnider model group. At steady state, the median BIS difference (95% CI) was -0.3 (-5.7 to 5.3), which was within the predefined interval for declaring equivalence. The Schnider model group's mean BIS at steady state did not differ from that of the previous study's Schnider model group. Conclusion: Reasons for the progressive BIS decrease to lower than expected values include delayed response-times by the BIS monitor, C-e overshoot explained by front-end kinetics, neural inertia and the choice of surrogate LOC indicator. We conclude that C-e-TCI using the Adjusted-Marsh parameter set results in equivalent hypnotic effects to those of the Schnider model, with the proviso that this may apply only to young adults of normal body habitus."
Molecular dynamics study of CDC25B(R492L) mutant causing the activity decrease of CDC25B,JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR GRAPHICS & MODELLING,"Cell division cycle 25B (CDC25B) was responsible for regulating the various stages of cell division in the cell cycle. R492L was one of the common types of CDC25B mutants. Researches showed that compared to CDC25B(WT), CDC25B(R492L) mutant had a similar to 100-fold reduction in the rate constant for forming phosphatase intermediate (k(2)). However, the molecular basis of how the CDC25B(R492L) mutant influenced the process of binding between CDC25B and CDK2/CyclinA was not yet known. Therefore, the optimizations of three-dimensional structure of the CDC25B(WT)-CDK2/CyclinA system and the CDC25B(R492L)-CDK2/CyclinA system were constructed by ZDOCK and RDOCK, and five methods were employed to verify the reasonability of the docking structure. Then the molecular dynamics simulations on the two systems were performed to explore the reason why CDC25B(R492L) mutant caused the weak interactions between CDC25B(R492L) and CDK2/CyclinA, respectively. The remote docking site (Arg488-Tyr497) and the second active site (Lys538-Arg544) of CDC25B were observed to have high fluctuations in the CDC25B(R492L) -CDK2/CyclinA system with post-analysis, where the high fluctuation of these two regions resulted in weak interactions between CD25B and CDK2. In addition, Asp38-G1u42 and Asp206Asp210 of CDK2 showed the slightly descending fluctuation, and CDK2 revealed an enhanced the self-interaction, which made CDK2 keep a relatively stable state in the CDC25B(R492L)-CDK2/CyclinA system. Finally, Leu492 of CDC25B was speculated to be the key residue, which had great effects on the binding between CDC25B(R492L) and CDK2 in the CDC25B(R492L) -CDK2/CyclinA system. Consequently, overall analyses appeared in this study ultimately offered a helpful understanding of the weak interactions between CDC25B(R492L) and CDK2."
A Bayesian latent class mixture model with censoring for correlation analysis in antimicrobial resistance across populations,BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY,"Background The emergence of antimicrobial resistance across populations is a global threat to public health. Surveillance programs often monitor human and animal populations to evaluate trends of emergence in these populations. Many national level antibiotic resistance surveillance programs quantify the proportion of resistant bacteria as a means of monitoring emergence and control measures. The reason for monitoring these different populations are many, including interest in similar changes in resistance which might provide insight into emergence and control options. Methods In this research, we developed a method to quantify the correlation in antimicrobial resistance across populations, for the conventionally unnoticed mean shift of the susceptible bacteria. With the proposed Bayesian latent class mixture model with censoring and multivariate normal hierarchy, we address several challenges associated with analyzing the minimum inhibitory concentration data. Results Application of this approach to the surveillance data from National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System led to a detection of positive correlation in the central tendency of azithromycin resistance of the susceptible populations from Salmonella serotype Typhimurium across food animal and human populations. Conclusions Our proposed approach has been shown to be accurate and superior to the commonly used naive estimation by simulation studies. Further implementation of this Bayesian model could serve as a useful tool to indicate the co-existence of antimicrobial resistance, and potentially a need of clinical intervention."
The role of population pharmacokinetic analysis in rational antibiotic therapy in neonates,PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING 2017 (CMBEBIH 2017),"Due to dynamic maturational changes in neonatal life, changes in pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) processes of drugs administered to neonates are expected. However, children are mostly treated off-label, i.e. without testing the drug in children but based on the extrapolation of data from adults. For the optimisation of dosage regimens in neonates, besides Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and a Bayesian feedback algorithm, population PK approach became relevant. Population PK modeling is a stepwise approach with building of structural and covariate models, model evaluation and simulations resulting in estimation of the population mean values of PK parameters such as clearance and volume of distribution, their inter- and intra-individual variabilities, covariates as well as on simulation-based optimised dosing proposals. The relevance of those approaches in overcoming gaps between realistic and feasible in-practice situations while performing PK studies in children, and taking into account ethical requests to minimise the number of studies in children and to minimise the number of children recruited to studies is also recognised by the authorities. In this article, we aimed to emphasise the importance of the research and of the population PK approach in the improvement of rational antibiotic therapy in neonates and to illustrate this with some specific compounds. For this reason, we gave a short overview of the population PK studies of the most frequently used antibiotics in European neonatal intensive care units. As final results of performed population PK analyses, optimised dosing regimens were proposed for rational antibiotic treatment and prophylaxis of neonates."
Ambulatory neurological care in a prison population,REVISTA DE NEUROLOGIA,"Aims. Some of the users attended in a Neurology service consist of the inmate population in a prison. The aim of this study v is to analyse all the proposals referred from the Alicante II Prison Centre to a Neurology service. Patients and methods. We analyse and describe the clinical characteristics of patients referred from the Alicante If Prison Centre to the Neurology service at the Centro Sanitario Integrado in Villena between the years 2003 and 2006. This analysis involved the following variables: age, sex, personal history, reason for visiting and diagnosis. Results. A total of 88 proposals were recorded. The mean age of the patients was 35 years (84 males/4 females). A total of 15 patients did not attend their appointment (17%). Positive serology for the human immunodeficiency virus was found in 18% of patients. The most frequent reoson for visiting was headache (32%), followed by seizures (25%) and, thirdly, vascular pathologies (13%). In a group of 16 patients (18%) the main diagnosis was established as being some kind of psychiatric disorder (anxiety, depression, simulation). Conclusions. No studies have been published in the literature that analyse the clinical characteristics of patients from prisons referred to a Neurology service. The high percentage of patients who do not attend their appointment and the high percentage of psychiatric disorders that are diagnosed within this group of patients are especially noteworthy However and as cat? be observed in the general population, headache is still the most common reason for visiting. Nevertheless, the group of neurological diagnoses that are most frequently attended is epilepsy."
Which accelerator photon beams are clinic-like for reference dosimetry purposes?,MEDICAL PHYSICS,"Previous work has demonstrated that, for photon beam dosimetry, TPR1020 is not an ideal beam quality specifier for all bremsstrahlung beams, especially for lightly filtered beams in some standards laboratories. This paper addresses the following questions: Is TPR1020 an adequate beam quality specifier for all modem clinical therapy accelerators? When can nonclinical beams in standards laboratories be used to calibrate ion chambers or measure k(Q) factors as a function of TPR1020? Based on detailed Monte Carlo simulations of Varian, Siemens, Elckta, and GE (Saturn) accelerators one can conclude that TPR1020 is an adequate beam quality specifier for all these machines in the sense that for a given value of TPR1020, the value of stopping-power ratios is the same. It is shown that, for the heavily filtered beams used in standards laboratories, TPR1020 is an adequate beam quality specifier. It is also demonstrated that, for a larger range of bremsstrahlung beams than previously, %dd(10)(x) is a good beam quality specifier for all clinical beams as well as the lightly and heavily 20 filtered beams in some standards laboratories. A criterion, based on the measured values of TPR1020 and %dd(10)(x) for the beam, is proposed for determining whether a nonclinical beam is well specified by TPR1020. Agreement between calculations for specific accelerators and measured beam quality specifiers is shown to be good, but agreement with published data for a variety of clinical accelerators is not as good. Possible reasons for the discrepancy are discussed."
Combining Molecular Dynamics with Bayesian Analysis To Predict and Evaluate Ligand-Binding Mutations in Influenza Hemagglutinin,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY,"Influenza virus attaches to and infects target cells via binding of cell-surface glycans by the viral hemagglutinin. This binding specificity is considered a major reason why avian influenza is typically poorly transmitted between humans, while swine influenza is better transmitted due to glycan similarity between the human and swine upper respiratory tract. Predicting mutations that control glycan binding is thus important to continued surveillance against new pandemic influenza strains. We have designed a molecular-dynamics approach for scoring potential mutants with predictive power for both receptor-binding-domain and allosteric mutations similar to those identified from clinical isolates of avian influenza. We have performed thousands of simulations of 17 different hemagglutinin mutants totaling >1 ms in length and employ a Bayesian model to rank mutations that disrupt the stability of the hemagglutinin-Ligand complex. Based on our simulations, we predict a significantly increased k(off) for seven of these mutants. This means of using molecular dynamics analysis to make experimentally verifiable predictions offers a potentially general method to identify ligand-binding mutants, particularly allosteric ones. Our analysis of ligand dissociation provides a means to evaluate mutants prior to experimental mutagenesis and testing and constitutes an important step toward understanding the determinants of ligand binding by H5N1 influenza"
The genetic study of three population microisolates in South Tyrol (MICROS): Study design and epidemiological perspectives,BMC MEDICAL GENETICS,"Background: There is increasing evidence of the important role that small, isolated populations could play in finding genes involved in the etiology of diseases. For historical and political reasons, South Tyrol, the northern most Italian region, includes several villages of small dimensions which remained isolated over the centuries. Methods: The MICROS study is a population- based survey on three small, isolated villages, characterized by: old settlement; small number of founders; high endogamy rates; slow/null population expansion. During the stage-I (2002/03) genealogical data, screening questionnaires, clinical measurements, blood and urine samples, and DNA were collected for 1175 adult volunteers. Stage-2, concerning trait diagnoses, linkage analysis and association studies, is ongoing. The selection of the traits is being driven by expert clinicians. Preliminary, descriptive statistics were obtained. Power simulations for finding linkage on a quantitative trait locus (QTL) were undertaken. Results: Starting from participants, genealogies were reconstructed for 50,037 subjects, going back to the early 1600s. Within the last five generations, subjects were clustered in one pedigree of 7049 subjects plus 178 smaller pedigrees (3 to 85 subjects each). A significant probability of familial clustering was assessed for many traits, especially among the cardiovascular, neurological and respiratory traits. Simulations showed that the MICROS pedigree has a substantial power to detect a LOD score >= 3 when the QTL specific heritability is >= 20%. Conclusion: The MICROS study is an extensive, ongoing, two-stage survey aimed at characterizing the genetic epidemiology of Mendelian and complex diseases. Our approach, involving different scientific disciplines, is an advantageous strategy to define and to study population isolates. The isolation of the Alpine populations, together with the extensive data collected so far, make the MICROS study a powerful resource for the study of diseases in many fields of medicine. Recent successes and simulation studies give us confidence that our pedigrees can be valuable both in finding new candidates loci and to confirm existing candidate genes."
"Joint Modeling of Outcome, Observation Time, and Missingness",JOURNAL OF BIOPHARMACEUTICAL STATISTICS,"A modeling framework is described for the specific setting of clinical trials in which there is only a single post-randomization response measurement, which may itself be missing, or, for clinical reasons, may be measured before the trial end. Such settings have three simultaneous processes: the outcome itself, the time to measurement, and the occurrence of missing values. A simple latent variable structure within a multivariate Gaussian distribution is used to model them. The full model is strictly nonrandom with respect to the missing value process, and therefore estimability of certain parameters depends on unverifiable assumptions. We use a simulation study to assess the behavior of the maximum likelihood estimators from the model; we then compare and contrast with a simpler last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach that ignores both the time to response and the missingness process, and is commonly used in practice in such settings. The proposed approach is illustrated using data from a trial on the treatment of congestive heart failure, in which the response measurements were obtained by echocardiography."
Information fraction estimation based on the number of events within the standard treatment regimen,BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL,"For a Phase III randomized trial that compares survival outcomes between an experimental treatment versus a standard therapy, interim monitoring analysis is used to potentially terminate the study early based on efficacy. To preserve the nominal Type I error rate, alpha spending methods and information fractions are used to compute appropriate rejection boundaries in studies with planned interim analyses. For a one-sided trial design applied to a scenario in which the experimental therapy is superior to the standard therapy, interim monitoring should provide the opportunity to stop the trial prior to full follow-up and conclude that the experimental therapy is superior. This paper proposes a method called total control only (TCO) for estimating the information fraction based on the number of events within the standard treatment regimen. Based on theoretical derivations and simulation studies, for a maximum duration superiority design, the TCO method is not influenced by departure from the designed hazard ratio, is sensitive to detecting treatment differences, and preserves the Type I error rate compared to information fraction estimation methods that are based on total observed events. The TCO method is simple to apply, provides unbiased estimates of the information fraction, and does not rely on statistical assumptions that are impossible to verify at the design stage. For these reasons, the TCO method is a good approach when designing a maximum duration superiority trial with planned interim monitoring analyses."
"Efficacy, safety and tolerability of topical terbinafine nail solution in patients with mild-to-moderate toenail onychomycosis: results from three randomized studies using double-blind vehicle-controlled and open-label active-controlled designs",JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY,"Background Terbinafine nail solution (TNS) was developed for the treatment of onychomycosis. Objective To assess the efficacy of TNS vs. vehicle and amorolfine 5% nail lacquer. Methods Subjects with mild-to-moderate toe onychomycosis (25% to 75% nail-involvement, matrix uninvolved) were randomized to receive either TNS or vehicle in two double-blind studies, and to TNS or amorolfine in an active-controlled, open-label study. Primary endpoint was complete cure (no residual clinical involvement and negative mycology) at week 52. Secondary endpoints were mycological cure (negative mycology defined as negative KOH microscopy and negative culture) and clinical effectiveness (10% residual-involvement and negative mycology) at week 52. Results Complete cure was not different between TNS vs. vehicle and amorolfine. Mycological cure was higher with TNS vs. vehicle, as was clinical effectiveness with TNS vs. vehicle, and TNS and amorolfine were not different for secondary efficacy endpoints. Patients achieving mycological cure had a better clinical outcome, and efficacy was improved in subjects with milder disease. Post hoc analysis suggests that nail thickness is an important prognostic factor. Moreover, mycological cure may require 6months of treatment regimen while complete cure and clinical effectiveness may be achievable only after 10months. A simulation study suggests that longer treatment duration would have resulted in higher complete cure with TNS vs. vehicle. Study treatments were well-tolerated. Conclusion Primary efficacy objectives were not met in the studies reported herein. Possible reasons for failure to achieve significant outcomes include insufficient length of treatment; stringency of primary endpoint and severity of nail involvement of study population."
On the performance and accuracy of PFEM-2 in the solution of biomedical benchmarks,COMPUTATIONAL PARTICLE MECHANICS,"In recent years, the biomedical industry has shown increased interest in using numerical methods to assist in the R&D of medical devices. The long-term goal is to reduce the costly and lengthy process that clinical trials take for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve a medical device. For this reason, both the FDA and academia are working together to create laboratory experiments that will help the industry gain confidence in numerical techniques as well as provide software developers with insights into the strengths and weaknesses of numerical software. In this article, three benchmarks proposed by the FDA are used to compare experimental results with those of a finite element method formulation and enhanced particle finite element method (PFEM-2). The first benchmark problem is the flow in a nozzle containing both, a gradual and a sudden change in diameter with the goal of predicting hemolysis (not studied in this work). The second problem studies the flow in a simplified centrifugal blood pump under various operation conditions. Finally, the third benchmark studies the steady flow in a patient-averaged inferior vena cava. PFEM-2 is regarded as a tool with great potential, mainly because no stabilization is needed for the Galerkin approximation of the advection term in the transport equations. This could be a big advantage in problems with flows at high Reynolds number. The improved time integration along streamlines provide a more accurate way to analyze a problem with a large time step. This paper is an effort to test PFEM-2 in engineering applications."
Development of the Uncertainty Communication Checklist: A Patient-Centered Approach to Patient Discharge From the Emergency Department,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,"Clear communication with patients upon emergency department (ED) discharge is important for patient safety during the transition to outpatient care. Over one-third of patients are discharged from the ED with diagnostic uncertainty, yet there is no established approach for effective discharge communication in this scenario. From 2017 to 2019, the authors developed the Uncertainty Communication Checklist for use in simulation-based training and assessment of emergency physician communication skills when discharging patients with diagnostic uncertainty. This development process followed the established 12-step Checklist Development Checklist framework and integrated patient feedback into 6 of the 12 steps. Patient input was included as it has potential to improve patient-centeredness of checklists related to assessment of clinical performance. Focus group patient participants from 2 clinical sites were included: Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, PA, and Northwestern University Hospital, Chicago, Illinois. The authors developed a preliminary instrument based on existing checklists, clinical experience, literature review, and input from an expert panel comprising health care professionals and patient advocates. They then refined the instrument based on feedback from 2 waves of patient focus groups, resulting in a final 21-item checklist. The checklist items assess if uncertainty was addressed in each step of the discharge communication, including the following major categories: introduction, test results/ED summary, no/uncertain diagnosis, next steps/follow-up, home care, reasons to return, and general communication skills. Patient input influenced both what items were included and the wording of items in the final checklist. This patient-centered, systematic approach to checklist development is built upon the rigor of the Checklist Development Checklist and provides an illustration of how to integrate patient feedback into the design of assessment tools when appropriate."
"Gibson's Theory of Affordances and Situational Awareness Occurring in Urban Departments of Pediatrics, Medicine, and Emergency Medicine",EDUCATION FOR HEALTH,"Background: The Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety (TeamSTEPPS (R)) program provides a situation-monitoring tool that allows health-care professionals to perform an environmental scan. This process includes scanning the status of the patient, team members, and the environment, to ensure that patient care is progressing toward the goal. It is assumed that health-care professionals will act in a certain way by providing feedback and support based on the scan. However, there is limited research supporting the impact of the clinical environment on behavior among health-care professionals. Methods: This qualitative research used in situ simulation and a theoretical sampling of six day and overnight shift clinical teams (n = 34) from three departments in an urban hospital in New York City: pediatric medicine, emergency medicine, and internal medicine. Notebook entries by the participants at three intervals during the case and a debriefing following the cases captured participant views, observations, and concerns about the immediate clinical environment. Results: In all six cases, and with every shift, there were documented examples of someone in the environment who saw something but did not speak up, possibly making a difference in regard to patient safety and the outcomes in the case. Some of the noted reasons include not wanting to be wrong, not wanting to hurt someone's feelings, or not being sure. Discussion: Our research explored the environmental scan that health-care team members conducted in three unique department settings, including how they perceived affordances, and the reasons why individuals may not speak up when another team member is not performing properly. Each person possesses a unique awareness and deficit of available affordances because of his/her position in the environment. Patient safety is somewhat reliant on the views and observations of each team member. Educators should use these outcomes to justify teamwork and communication training that includes targeted emphasis on providing candid feedback, situation monitoring, and mutual support."
HEPATITIS-B PREVENTION IN EUROPE - A PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC-EVALUATION,VACCINE,"The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 350 million people in the world are carriers of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), 60 million of whom may die from liver cancer and about 45 million from cirrhosis. In the WHO European Region, which has a total population of 839 million inhabitants, the aver-age number of acute hepatitis B cases reported in 1991 was approximately 160 000, giving an incidence of 19 per 100 000 population. This incidence rate varies from 5 per 100 000 in western Europe to 22 per 100 000 in central Europe and 92 per 100 000 in eastern Europe. Because of under-reporting and the fact that two-thirds Of infections are asymptomatic, the reported incidence rate considerably underestimates the true incidence of HBV in Europe. For this reason, we may multiply the number of reported cases by a factor of 6 (by 2 for under-reporting and by 3 for the symptomatic/asymptomatic ratio): an estimated 900 000 to 1 000 000 infections of HBV occur in Europe each year. Approximately 90 000 chronic infections will develop from these new, cases. The spread of HBV can be controlled by universal infant or adolescent vaccination. A decision-tree-based analytical model was wed to assess the clinical and economic impact of these two interventions. The model took into account incidence and prevalence rates of HBV natural history of infection, compliance and effectiveness of vaccination, and direct and indirect costs. Data were obtained from the literature and from a WHO European survey. The cost-effectiveness ratio amounts to pound 6443 and pound 4745 per infection prevented for neonatal and adolescent vaccination, respectively. The results from these calculations show that neither vaccination of neonates ol of adolescents is cost-saving. However, the cost-effectiveness - i.e. the cost incurred to prevent an HBV infection is of an acceptable magnitude for both strategies."
Association of Extended Dosing Intervals or Delays in Pembrolizumab-based Regimens With Survival Outcomes in Advanced Non-small-cell Lung Cancer,CLINICAL LUNG CANCER,"The most cost-effective administration frequency of pembrolizumab in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer is unknown. We found that a significant proportion of these patients receive pembrolizumab-based regimens with extended intervals or delays in routine practice, with similar outcomes to those on label-specified 3-week interval treatments. Prospective evaluation of alternative dosing strategies is warranted to develop a more fiscally viable and patient-centered model. Background: Besides modeling/simulation-based analysis, no post-approval studies have evaluated the optimal administration frequency of pembrolizumab in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients and Methods: We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study to evaluate the association between survival outcomes and treatment extensions/delays of pembrolizumab-based regimens in patients with advancedNSCLC. Thosewho had received at least 4 cycles in routine practicewere divided into 2 groups: nonstandard (Non-Std, >= 2 cycles at intervals > 3weeks + 3 days) and standard (Std, all cycles every 3 weeks or 1 cycle > 3 weeks + 3 days). Results: Among 150 patients, 92 (61%) were eligible for the study (Non-Std, 27; Std, 65). The reasons for patientswith extensions/delays in theNon-Std group included: immune-related adverse events (irAEs) (33%), noneirAE-related medical issues (26%), and patient-physician preference (41%). The Non-Std group was more likely to have a higher programmed death-ligand 1 tumor proportion score, a higher number of treatment cycles, and pembrolizumab monotherapy. Univariate and 6-month landmark analyses showed longer median overall survival and progression-free survival in the Non-Std group compared with the Std group. After multivariable adjustment for confounding factors, therewas no significant difference in overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-4.8; P 1/4 .824) or progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-9.6; P 1/4 .157) between the 2 groups. Conclusion: Our study shows that a significant proportion of patients with advanced NSCLC receive pembrolizumab-based regimens with extended intervals or delays in routine clinical practice and with similar outcomes to those receiving treatment at label-specified 3-week intervals. Given the durability of benefit seen and the potential for cost reduction and decreased infusion frequency in these patients, this requires validation in prospective trials. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Sample size planning for phase II trials based on success probabilities for phase III,PHARMACEUTICAL STATISTICS,"In recent years, high failure rates in phase III trials were observed. One of the main reasons is overoptimistic assumptions for the planning of phase III resulting from limited phase II information and/or unawareness of realistic success probabilities. We present an approach for planning a phase II trial in a time-to-event setting that considers the whole phase II/III clinical development programme. We derive stopping boundaries after phase II that minimise the number of events under side conditions for the conditional probabilities of correct go/no-go decision after phase II as well as the conditional success probabilities for phase III. In addition, we give general recommendations for the choice of phase II sample size. Our simulations show that unconditional probabilities of go/no-go decision as well as the unconditional success probabilities for phase III are influenced by the number of events observed in phase II. However, choosing more than 150 events in phase II seems not necessary as the impact on these probabilities then becomes quite small. We recommend considering aspects like the number of compounds in phase II and the resources available when determining the sample size. The lower the number of compounds and the lower the resources are for phase III, the higher the investment for phase II should be. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
Spatial Resolution Requirements for Accurate Identification of Drivers of Atrial Fibrillation,CIRCULATION-ARRHYTHMIA AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY,"Background Recent studies have demonstrated conflicting mechanisms underlying atrial fibrillation (AF), with the spatial resolution of data often cited as a potential reason for the disagreement. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the variation in spatial resolution of mapping may lead to misinterpretation of the underlying mechanism in persistent AF. Methods and Results Simulations of rotors and focal sources were performed to estimate the minimum number of recording points required to correctly identify the underlying AF mechanism. The effects of different data types (action potentials and unipolar or bipolar electrograms) and rotor stability on resolution requirements were investigated. We also determined the ability of clinically used endocardial catheters to identify AF mechanisms using clinically recorded and simulated data. The spatial resolution required for correct identification of rotors and focal sources is a linear function of spatial wavelength (the distance between wavefronts) of the arrhythmia. Rotor localization errors are larger for electrogram data than for action potential data. Stationary rotors are more reliably identified compared with meandering trajectories, for any given spatial resolution. All clinical high-resolution multipolar catheters are of sufficient resolution to accurately detect and track rotors when placed over the rotor core although the low-resolution basket catheter is prone to false detections and may incorrectly identify rotors that are not present. Conclusions The spatial resolution of AF data can significantly affect the interpretation of the underlying AF mechanism. Therefore, the interpretation of human AF data must be taken in the context of the spatial resolution of the recordings."
The development and testing of a digital PET phantom for the evaluation of tumor volume segmentation techniques,MEDICAL PHYSICS,"Methods for accurate tumor volume segmentation of positron emission tomography (PET) images have been under investigation in recent years partly as a result of the increased use of PET in radiation treatment planning (RTP). None of the developed automated or semiautomated segmentation methods, however, has been shown reliable enough to be regarded as the standard. One reason for this is that there is no source of well characterized and reliable test data for evaluating such techniques. The authors have constructed a digital tumor phantom to address this need. The phantom was created using the Zubal phantom as input to the SimSET software used for PET simulations. Synthetic tumors were placed in the lung of the Zubal phantom to provide the targets for segmentation. The authors concentrated on the lung, since much of the interest to include PET in RTP is for nonsmall cell lung cancer. Several tests were performed on the phantom to ensure its close resemblance to clinical PET scans. The authors measured statistical quantities to compare image intensity distributions from regions-of-interest (ROIs) placed in the liver, the lungs, and tumors in phantom and clinical reconstructions. Using ROIs they also made measurements of autocorrelation functions to ensure the image texture is similar in clinical and phantom data. The authors also compared the intensity profile and appearance of real and simulated uniform activity spheres within uniform background. These measurements, along with visual comparisons of the phantom with clinical scans, indicate that the simulated phantom mimics reality quite well. Finally, they investigate and quantify the relationship between the threshold required to segment a tumor and the inhomogeneity of the tumor's image intensity distribution. The tests and various measurements performed in this study demonstrate how the phantom can offer a reliable way of testing and investigating tumor volume segmentation in PET.

Fabrication and evaluation of electrospun PCL-gelatin micro-/nanofiber membranes for anti-infective GTR implants,JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B,"Infection is the major reason for GTR/GBR membrane failure in clinical applications. In this work, we developed GTR/GBR membranes with localized drug delivery function to prevent infection. Hierarchical membranes containing micro- and nano-fibers were fabricated. The effects of the incorporation of gelatin and loading content of metronidazole (NINA) (0, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 wt% polymer) on the properties of the electrospun membranes were investigated. The interaction between PCL and MNA was identified by molecular dynamics simulation. MNA was released in a controlled manner, and the antibacterial activity of the released MNA remained. The incorporation of gelatin and MNA improved the hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, and in vitro biodegradation rate of PCL nanofibers. The electrospun membranes allowed cells to adhere to and proliferate on them and showed excellent barrier function. The membrane loaded with 30% MNA had the best comprehensive properties. Subcutaneous implantation results demonstrated that MNA-loaded membranes evoked a less severe inflammatory response than pure PCL nanofibers. These results demonstrated the potential of MNA-loaded membranes as GTR/GBR membranes with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory functions for biomedical applications."
The movement and deposition of PM2.5 in the upper respiratory tract for the patients with heart failure: an elementary CFD study,BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE,"Background: PM2.5 is an important factor to affect the patients with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Clinical studies have found that the morbidity and mortality of patients with heart failure (HF) have a close relationship with the movement and deposition state of PM2.5. One reason is that the breathing pattern of patients with HF has obvious difference with healthy people, however the effect caused by these differences on the distribution regularity of PM2.5 in the respiratory tract is still unclear. Hence, a computational fluid dynamics simulation was conducted to clarify the aerodynamic effect of breathing pattern of patients with HF on respiratory system. Methods: Ideal upper respiratory tract geometric model was established based on standardized aerosol research laboratory of Alberta and Weibel A dimension. The discrete phase method is used to calculate the movement of the airflow and particles. The flow rate were chosen as the inlet boundary conditions, and the outlets are set at a constant pressure. The rate of particle deposition, distribution location, wall pressure, flow velocity and wall shear stress are obtained, and compared to the normal control. Results: The results demonstrated that the rate of escaped particles in every bronchial outlet of the patients with HF was more than the normal controls, meanwhile the trapped was less (1024 < 1160). There was higher by 12.9% possibility that the PM2.5 entered the lungs than the normal control. Conclusion: The aerodynamic performances of HF patients are different from normal control. Compared to the normal control, under similar environment, there is higher possibility of PM2.5 moving into lungs, and these particles could affect the function of the respiratory system, resulting in the deterioration of the state of cardiovascular system. In short, it's necessary to pay more attention to the living environment of HF patients, to reduce the content of PM2.5 particles in the air, and reduce the damage of PM2.5 particles caused by breathing patterns."
Case-mix adjustment in non-randomised observational evaluations: the constant risk fallacy,JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH,"Observational studies comparing groups or populations to evaluate services or interventions usually require case- mix adjustment to account for imbalances between the groups being compared. Simulation studies have, however, shown that case- mix adjustment can make any bias worse. One reason this can happen is if the risk factors used in the adjustment are related to the risk in different ways in the groups or populations being compared, and ignoring this commits the  constant risk fallacy''. Case- mix adjustment is particularly prone to this problem when the adjustment uses factors that are proxies for the real risk factors. Interactions between risk factors and groups should always be examined before case- mix adjustment in observational studies."
Sampling strategies to evaluate the prognostic value of a new biomarker on a time-to-event end-point,BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY,"Background The availability of large epidemiological or clinical data storing biological samples allow to study the prognostic value of novel biomarkers, but efficient designs are needed to select a subsample on which to measure them, for parsimony and economical reasons. Two-phase stratified sampling is a flexible approach to perform such sub-sampling, but literature on stratification variables to be used in the sampling and power evaluation is lacking especially for survival data. Methods We compared the performance of different sampling designs to assess the prognostic value of a new biomarker on a time-to-event endpoint, applying a Cox model weighted by the inverse of the empirical inclusion probability. Results Our simulation results suggest that case-control stratified (or post stratified) by a surrogate variable of the marker can yield higher performances than simple random, probability proportional to size, and case-control sampling. In the presence of high censoring rate, results showed an advantage of nested case-control and counter-matching designs in term of design effect, although the use of a fixed ratio between cases and controls might be disadvantageous. On real data on childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we found that optimal sampling using pilot data is greatly efficient. Conclusions Our study suggests that, in our sample, case-control stratified by surrogate and nested case-control yield estimates and power comparable to estimates obtained in the full cohort while strongly decreasing the number of patients required. We recommend to plan the sample size and using sampling designs for exploration of novel biomarker in clinical cohort data."
Patient-Specific Planning for Thermal Magnetic Resonance of Glioblastoma Multiforme,CANCERS,"Simple Summary Hyperthermia was proven to enhance the efficacy of chemo- and radiation therapy treatment of glioblastoma multiforme, an aggressive brain tumor of poor prognosis. Despite good clinical results in other tumor types and locations, hyperthermia induced by electromagnetic waves in the radiofrequency range is not available so far for the treatment of brain tumors due to the highly sensitive surrounding tissue and lack of non-invasive therapy monitoring. ThermalMR integrates non-invasive diagnosis, therapy, and therapy monitoring in a single RF applicator device by employing radiowaves for magnetic resonance imaging, radiofrequency heating, as well as magnetic resonance thermometry. This work examines three optimization algorithms for hyperthermia treatment planning and up to ten RF applicator configurations for a cohort of nine patient models with glioblastoma multiforme. Clinical diversity is represented in target size and location and the inclusion of post-operative models. Our findings indicate the need and potential for patient-specific treatment planning and RF applicator design when targeting brain tumors. Thermal intervention is a potent sensitizer of cells to chemo- and radiotherapy in cancer treatment. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a potential clinical target, given the cancer's aggressive nature and resistance to current treatment options. This drives research into optimization algorithms for treatment planning as well as radiofrequency (RF) applicator design for treatment delivery. In this work, nine clinically realistic GBM target volumes (TVs) for thermal intervention are compared using three optimization algorithms and up to ten RF applicator designs for thermal magnetic resonance. Hyperthermia treatment planning (HTP) was successfully performed for all cases, including very small, large, and even split target volumes. Minimum requirements formulated for the metrics assessing HTP outcome were met and exceeded for all patient specific cases. Results indicate a 16 channel two row arrangement to be most promising. HTP of TVs with a small extent in the cranial-caudal direction in conjunction with a large radial extent remains challenging despite the advanced optimization algorithms used. In general, deep seated targets are favorable. Overall, our findings indicate that a one-size-fits-all RF applicator might not be the ultimate approach in hyperthermia of brain tumors. It stands to reason that modular and reconfigurable RF applicator configurations might best suit the needs of targeting individual GBM geometry."
Emerging Vaccine Informatics,JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICINE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,"Vaccine informatics is an emerging research area that focuses on development and applications of bioinformatics methods that can be used to facilitate every aspect of the preclinical, clinical, and postlicensure vaccine enterprises. Many immunoinformatics algorithms and resources have been developed to predict T-and B-cell immune epitopes for epitope vaccine development and protective immunity analysis. Vaccine protein candidates are predictable in silico from genome sequences using reverse vaccinology. Systematic transcriptomics and proteomics gene expression analyses facilitate rational vaccine design and identification of gene responses that are correlates of protection in vivo. Mathematical simulations have been used to model host-pathogen interactions and improve vaccine production and vaccination protocols. Computational methods have also been used for development of immunization registries or immunization information systems, assessment of vaccine safety and efficacy, and immunization modeling.

Self-projection and the default network in frontotemporal dementia,NATURE REVIEWS NEUROLOGY,"Converging evidence suggests that when individuals are left to think to themselves, a socalled default network of the brain is engaged, allowing the individual to daydream, reflect on their past, imagine possible future scenarios, and consider the viewpoints of others. These flexible self-relevant mental explorations enable the anticipation and evaluation of events before they occur, and are essential for successful social interactions. Such self-projective efforts are particularly vulnerable to disruption in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a neurodegenerative disorder involving damage to the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. In this Review, we explore how the progressive degeneration of the neural networks in two subtypes of FTD-the behavioral variant and semantic dementia-affects key structures of the default network and putative self-projective functions. We examine the available evidence from studies of autobiographical memory, episodic future thinking, theory of mind, moral reasoning, and economic decision-making in these neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, we propose that the mapping of default-network functions onto discrete subsystems of the default network may need revision in light of neuropsychological and clinical evidence from studies in patients with FTD."
Employment of intra-individual variability to improve computerized ECG interpretation,"MEDINFO 2001: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 10TH WORLD CONGRESS ON MEDICAL INFORMATICS, PTS 1 AND 2","One of the reasons for the limited practical utility of computer programs for interpretation Of electrocardiograms (ECGs) is their susceptibility to intraindividual variability. Two of the most prominent sources of intra-individual variability in ECGs, electrode placement variations and respiration, were studied for their effects on computerized ECG interpretation. Previous research has shown that the effects of intra-individual variability on computerized ECG interpretation depend largely on the individual ECG. To enable the assessment of chest electrode position variations for individual standard 12-lead ECGs, ECGs resulting from simulations of such position variations were interpreted. Variability due to respiration was assessed by interpretating all individual ECG beats instead of an averaged beat. In this paper two methods are presented that employ information about the intra-individual variability in individual ECGs. The first method provides an estimate of the reliability of the interpretation, the second attempts to improve the interpretation itself In the first method we quantified the variation in interpretation caused by the two sources of intra-individual variability with the use of a stability index, a high index value indicating a low variation in interpretation. This index was subsequently studied using two sets of ECGs. For the first set a 'clinical' reference interpretation was obtained from discharge letters. For the second set three cardiologists provided a 'cardiologists' reference. The performance of subgroups of ECGs having stability indices higher than a particular value was computed, It appeared that for the 'cardiologists' reference, the interpretations of ECGs with a high stability index were more often correct. No effect was found for the 'clinical' reference. In the second method we attempted to improve the original interpretation by combining the alternative interpretations into a new interpretation. This was done by taking the median or the average of the quantified alternatives. These combined interpretations proved to perform better than the original interpretation when a cardiologist's interpretation was taken as a reference. This paper shows that intra-individual ECG variability can be used to improve original interpretations. This can be done without having, to record multiple ECGs, provided that a model is available to simulate intra-individual variability. The presented methods do not depend on the classification algorithm that is used. They can be used both during classifier design to correct imperfections, and in routine use of the classifier to produce more representative classifications."
A latent class based imputation method under Bayesian quantile regression framework using asymmetric Laplace distribution for longitudinal medication usage data with intermittent missing values,JOURNAL OF BIOPHARMACEUTICAL STATISTICS,"Evaluating the association between diseases and the longitudinal pattern of pharmacological therapy has become increasingly important. However, in many longitudinal studies, self-reported medication usage data collected at patients' follow-up visits could be missing for various reasons. These pieces of missing or inaccurate/untenable information complicate determining the trajectory of medication use and its complete effects for patients. Although longitudinal models can deal with specific types of missing data, inappropriate handling of this issue can lead to a biased estimation of regression parameters especially when missing data mechanisms are complex and depend upon multiple sources of variation. We propose a latent class-based multiple imputation (MI) approach using a Bayesian quantile regression (BQR) that incorporates cluster of unobserved heterogeneity for medication usage data with intermittent missing values. Findings from our simulation study indicate that the proposed method performs better than traditional MI methods under certain scenarios of data distribution. We also demonstrate applications of the proposed method to data from the Prospective Study of Outcomes in Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) cohort when assessing an association between longitudinal nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) usage and radiographic damage in AS, while the longitudinal NSAID index data are intermittently missing."
Noninvasive Intracranial Hypertension Detection Utilizing Semisupervised Learning,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,"Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is an established clinical practice in managing patients with risk of acute ICP elevation although the clinically accepted way of measuring ICP remains invasive. However, the invasive nature of ICP measurement obviates its application in many clinical circumstances such as diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IH). We propose a noninvasive diagnostic tool for IH based on the morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow velocity waveforms. We mainly compare two types of IH detection methods: one based on the traditional supervised learning approach and the other based on the semisupervised learning approach. Our simulation results demonstrate that the predictive accuracy (area under the curve) of the semisupervised IH detection method can be as high as 92% while that of the supervised IH detection method is only around 82%. It should be noted that the predictive accuracy of the pulsatility index (PI)-based IH detection method is as low as 59%. Although the predictive accuracy is a widely used accuracy measurement, it does not consider clinical consequences of necessary and unnecessary treatments. For this reason, we have adopted the decision curve analysis to address this issue. The decision curve analysis results show that the semisupervised IH detection method is not only more accurate, but also clinically more useful than the supervised IH detection method or the PI-based IH detection method."
The effect of finite diffusion gradient pulse duration on fibre orientation estimation in diffusion MRI,NEUROIMAGE,"An essential step for fibre-tracking is the accurate estimation of neuronal fibre orientations within each imaging voxel, and a number of methods have been proposed to reconstruct the orientation distribution function based on sampling three-dimensional q-space. In the q-space formalism, very short (infinitesimal) gradient pulses are the basic requirement to obtain the true spin displacement probability density function. On current clinical MR systems however, the diffusion gradient pulse duration (delta) is inevitably finite due to the limit on the achievable gradient intensity. The failure to satisfy the short gradient pulse (SGP) requirement has been a recurrent criticism for fibre orientation estimation based on the q-space approach. In this study, the influence of a finite delta on the DW signal measured as a function of gradient direction is described theoretically and demonstrated through simulations and experimental models. Our results suggest that the current practice of using long delta for DW imaging on human clinical MR scanners, which is enforced by hardware limitations, might in fact be beneficial for estimating fibre orientations. For a given b-value, the prolongation of delta is advantageous for estimating fibre orientations for two reasons: first, it leads to a boost in DW signal in the transverse plane of the fibre. Second, it stretches out the shape of the measured diffusion profile, which improves the contrast between DW orientations. This is especially beneficial for resolving crossing fibres, as this contrast is essential to discriminate between different fibre directions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
A Machine Learning Methodology for Diagnosing Chronic Kidney Disease,IEEE ACCESS,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health problem with high morbidity and mortality rate, and it induces other diseases. Since there are no obvious symptoms during the early stages of CKD, patients often fail to notice the disease. Early detection of CKD enables patients to receive timely treatment to ameliorate the progression of this disease. Machine learning models can effectively aid clinicians achieve this goal due to their fast and accurate recognition performance. In this study, we propose a machine learning methodology for diagnosing CKD. The CKD data set was obtained from the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository, which has a large number of missing values. KNN imputation was used to fill in the missing values, which selects several complete samples with the most similar measurements to process the missing data for each incomplete sample. Missing values are usually seen in real-life medical situations because patients may miss some measurements for various reasons. After effectively filling out the incomplete data set, six machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes classifier and feed forward neural network) were used to establish models. Among these machine learning models, random forest achieved the best performance with 99.75% diagnosis accuracy. By analyzing the misjudgments generated by the established models, we proposed an integrated model that combines logistic regression and random forest by using perceptron, which could achieve an average accuracy of 99.83% after ten times of simulation. Hence, we speculated that this methodology could be applicable to more complicated clinical data for disease diagnosis."
Dental decision-making under general anesthesia for patients with disabilities: A qualitative study,SPECIAL CARE IN DENTISTRY,"Aims: This paper explores the variables which influence decision-making processes in dentists providing dental care for people with disabilities under general anesthesia (GA). Methods: Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were undertaken on a purposive sample. Audio recordings were transcribed and checked for accuracy. Using thematic content analysis methods open codes were developed inductively. Codes were analyzed further by three authors adopting a deductive approach, leading to final coding, sorting and themes, subtheme and framework development. Results: Three themes emerged. The first theme explored Shared Decision Making, or lack thereof, as it influenced clinical reasoning. The second (Systematic, Analytical) and third (Intuition, and heuristics) themes explored features of clinical judgment as considered under dual process theory. Dentists primarily used intuitive decision-making processes and heuristic styled processes (or cognitive mental frames) assisted in intuition to extract teeth, without engaging type 2 processes. Conclusion: The dentists experience subtle modifiers to their decision-making that ultimately promote extraction of teeth under GA for people with disabilities. Bias training, simulation and post-hoc reflection are examples of recommendations which may be used to improve decision-making in this area."
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY: THE FUTURE IS HERE,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCE AND PHARMA RESEARCH,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human behavior in relation to the processes of intelligence involved in problem solving. Such mechanisms include human cognitive science reading, observation, preparation, interpretation, reasoning, correction, speech recognition, linguistics, and other sources. AI simplifies tasks by making machines learn from past experiences, mapping efforts and actions to results, identifying errors, correcting them, adjusting to new and random input values, and effortlessly performing human-like tasks through in-depth scenario analysis. AI simplifies work by analyzing, filtering, sorting, predicting, scoping, and determining large data volumes to follow the best implementation procedures for producing an optimal solution. The major pharmaceutical industry applications of AI as on 2019 are; Discovery and development of new drugs; AI is helping big pharma create cures for complex and rare diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson, Drug-Adherence and Dosage; Using AI to make sense of clinical data and to produce better analytics; Finding more reliable patients faster for clinical trials; Introducing automated robot pharmacies to fill prescriptions and dispensing; and marketing, logistics and supply chain. AI is the future of pharma but the technology is available now. Artificial Intelligence can cut costs down, create new, effective treatments and above all else, help save lives. So biotech companies should start making use of the advantages of AI at the earliest. The industry therefore has a lot to gain from embracing solutions to AI and machine learning. It can be used to create a strong, sustainable pipeline of new medicines to good effect. Using the power of modern supercomputers and machine learning would make it possible for us to produce medicines faster and at reduced costs. This article reviews exhaustively the present status and future prospects of Artificial Intelligence in pharmaceutical sciences with specific attention to pharmaceutical industry. The literature has been collected from Pubmed, Google Scholar and commercial websites related to this field. More emphasis has been given to commercial application of AI in pharmaceutical industry in future. In conclusion, the future lies in cooperation between humans and machines, and alongside technological advances, human clinical experts will need to adapt, learn and grow. Although potential experts will have to be both medical and technology experts, it is evolution of medicine, not extinction."
Modeling of the children's hip joint in diagnostics of bone deformation in cerebral palsy,4TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"Development of a musculoskeletal system is strongly influenced by mechanical factors. Muscle forces are one of the most important sources of loadings acting on bone elements and any disturbances of their activity can lead to severe pathology. Cerebral palsy (CP) is an example of such a situation. Hip joint deformity, leading to its subluxation and finally dislocation, is one of the most serious complications accompanying CP. The aim of presented research is to establish the methodology of computer-aided diagnostics based on three-dimensional (3D) modeling and numerical simulation of the children's hip joint in the case of cerebral palsy. Geometrical models of pelvis and femoral bones were developed based on data obtained from computer tomography (CT). The data were processed with the use of MIMICS software and the structure of particular bone elements has been reconstructed. Based on this model a new kind of 3D index for rating hip joint deformity can be calculated. The final stage of research is FEM modeling (ANSYS v.11), which is very useful for understanding the mechanobiological reasons for bone deformity progress. Numerical modeling is very useful in diagnostics of bone deformity in cerebral palsied hip joint. Evaluation of the present stage of pathology as well as biomechanical analysis of its development is possible. In this way, optimization of the customized plan of treatment for particular patients can be performed."
Mechanistic insights into high mobility group box-1 (HMGb1)-induced Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) dimer formation,JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS,"Supplemental data for this article can be accessed here.High mobility group box-1 (HMGb1), an endogenous danger-associated molecular pattern protein (DAMP) whose extracellular release has been associated with sterile injury and various inflammatory diseases and conditions, has been shown to be a valuable clinical drug target. Elucidation of the specific interactions with the HMGb1 receptor, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and adaptor protein myeloid differentiation factor-2 (MD-2), will lead to more precisely targeted therapeutics. We sought to examine detailed interactions and dynamics of the HMGb1 A-box and B-box fragments, as well as the intact protein using in silico protein-protein docking (ZDOCK, ZRANK) and molecular dynamics (Schrodinger Desmond, New York, NY). Mutagenesis and SPR-binding studies allowed us to draw further conclusions regarding the details of the HMGb1-TLR4-MD2 interaction and shed light on the reasons for the opposing biological activities of HMGb1 A-box and B-box fragments. From our findings, we hypothesize that disulfide A-box fragment binds as an anchor toward the TLR4-MD-2 but does not facilitate the TLR4 dimer formation, thereby competing with the HMGb1-binding site and preventing HMGb1-induced signaling and downstream inflammation, whereas the pro-inflammatory B-box fragment retains the MD-2 active conformation and binds to both TLR4 proteins in the complex to aid TLR4 dimer formation, which activates the intracellular signaling for downstream inflammatory pathways and cytokine release.

Estimating Treatment Effects for Recurrent Events in the Presence of Rescue Medications: An Application to the Immune Thrombocytopenia Study,STATISTICS IN BIOSCIENCES,"In many clinical studies, patients may experience the same type of event of interest repeatedly over time. However, the assessment of treatment effects is often complicated by the rescue medication uses due to ethical reasons. For example, in the motivating trial in studying the Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP), when the interest lies in evaluating the treatment benefit of investigational product (IP) on reducing patient's repeated bleeding, rescue medication such as platelet transfusions may be allowed to raise platelet counts. Both the intention-to-treat analysis and treating the intermediate rescue medication as covariate tend to attenuate the treatment benefit, and the estimates can be biased if interpreted as causal. In this paper, we propose a general causal framework when intermediate rescue medications are informative. We adopt the inverse weighted estimation approach to estimate the treatment effect, where weights are constructed to reflect time-dependent medication use probabilities. The proposed estimators are shown to be asymptotically normal and are demonstrated to perform well in small-sample simulation studies. The application to the ITP studies reveals a stronger benefit of using IP in reducing bleeding."
Predicting target vessel location on robot-assisted coronary artery bypass graft using CT to ultrasound registration,MEDICAL PHYSICS,"Purpose: Although robot-assisted coronary artery bypass grafting (RA-CABG) has gained more acceptance worldwide, its success still depends on the surgeon's experience and expertise, and the conversion rate to full sternotomy is in the order of 15%-25%. One of the reasons for conversion is poor preoperative planning, which is based solely on pre-operative computed tomography (CT) images. In this paper, the authors propose a technique to estimate the global peri-operative displacement of the heart and to predict the intra-operative target vessel location, validated via both an in vitro and a clinical study. Methods: As the peri-operative heart migration during RA-CABG has never been reported in the literatures, a simple in vitro validation study was conducted using a heart phantom. To mimic the clinical workflow, a pre-operative CT as well as peri-operative ultrasound images at three different stages in the procedure (Stage(0)-following intubation; Stage(1)-following lung deflation; and Stage(2)-following thoracic insufflation) were acquired during the experiment. Following image acquisition, a rigid-body registration using iterative closest point algorithm with the robust estimator was employed to map the pre-operative stage to each of the peri-operative ones, to estimate the heart migration and predict the peri-operative target vessel location. Moreover, a clinical validation of this technique was conducted using offline patient data, where a Monte Carlo simulation was used to overcome the limitations arising due to the invisibility of the target vessel in the peri-operative ultrasound images. Results: For the in vitro study, the computed target registration error (TRE) at Stage(0), Stage(1), and Stage(2) was 2.1, 3.3, and 2.6 mm, respectively. According to the offline clinical validation study, the maximum TRE at the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery was 4.1 mm at Stage(0), 5.1 mm at Stage(1), and 3.4 mm at Stage(2). Conclusions: The authors proposed a method to measure and validate peri-operative shifts of the heart during RA-CABG. In vitro and clinical validation studies were conducted and yielded a TRE in the order of 5 mm for all cases. As the desired clinical accuracy imposed by this procedure is on the order of one intercostal space (10-15 mm), our technique suits the clinical requirements. The authors therefore believe this technique has the potential to improve the pre-operative planning by updating peri-operative migration patterns of the heart and, consequently, will lead to reduced conversion to conventional open thoracic procedures.

Indications for propensity scores and review of their use in pharmacoepidemiology,BASIC & CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & TOXICOLOGY,"Use of propensity scores to identify and control for confounding in observational studies that relate medications to outcomes has increased substantially in recent years. However, it remains unclear whether, and if so when, use of propensity scores provides estimates of drug effects that are less biased than those obtained from conventional multivariate models. In the great majority of published studies that have used both approaches, estimated effects from propensity score and regression methods have been similar. Simulation studies further suggest comparable performance of the two approaches in many settings. We discuss five reasons that favour use of propensity scores: the value of focus on indications for drug use; optimal matching strategies from alternative designs; improved control of confounding with scarce outcomes; ability to identify interactions between propensity of treatment and drug effects on outcomes; and correction for unobserved confounders via propensity score calibration. We describe alternative approaches to estimate and implement propensity scores and the limitations of the C-statistic for evaluation. Use of propensity scores will not correct biases from unmeasured confounders, but can aid in understanding determinants of drug use and lead to improved estimates of drug effects in some settings."
In vitro replication of spontaneous fractures of the proximal human femur,JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS,"Spontaneous fractures (i.e. caused by sudden loading and muscle contraction, not by trauma) represent a significant percentage of proximal femur fractures. They are particularly relevant as may occur in elderly (osteoporotic) subjects, but also in relation to epiphyseal prostheses. Despite its clinical and legal relevance, this type of fracture has seldom been investigated. Studies concerning spontaneous fractures are based on a variety of loading scenarios. There is no evidence, nor consensus on the most relevant loading scenario. The aim of this work was to develop and validate an experimental method to replicate spontaneous fractures in vitro based on clinically relevant loading. Primary goals were: (i) repeatability and reproducibility, (ii) clinical relevance. A validated numerical model was used to identify the most critical loading scenario that can lead to head-neck fractures, and to determine if it is necessary to include muscle forces when the head-neck region is under investigation. The numerical model indicated that the most relevant loading scenario is when the resultant joint force is applied to the head at 8 degrees from the diaphysis. Furthermore, it was found that it is not essential to include the muscles when investigating head-neck fractures. The experimental setup was consequently designed. The procedure included high-speed filming of the fracture event. Clinically relevant fracture modes were obtained on 10 cadaveric femurs. Failure load should be reported as a fraction of donor's body-weight to reduce variability. The proposed method can be used to investigate the reason and mechanism of failure of natural and operated proximal femurs. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Needle-tissue interaction forces - A survey of experimental data,MEDICAL ENGINEERING & PHYSICS,"The development of needles, needle-insertion simulators, and needle-wielding robots for use in a clinical environment depends on a thorough understanding of the mechanics of needle-tissue interaction. It stands to reason that the forces arising from this interaction are influenced by numerous factors, such as needle type, insertion speed, and tissue characteristics. However, exactly how these factors influence the force is not clear. For this reason, the influence of various factors on needle insertion-force was investigated by searching literature for experimental data. This resulted in a comprehensive overview of experimental insertion-force data available in the literature, grouped by factor for quick reference. In total, 99 papers presenting such force data were found, with typical peak forces in the order of 1-10N. The data suggest, for example, that higher velocity tends to decrease puncture force and increase friction. Furthermore, increased needle diameter was found to increase peak forces, and conical needles were found to create higher peak forces than beveled needles. However, many questions remain open for investigation, especially those concerning the influence of tissue characteristics. (C) 2012 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Implementation of a structured patient handoff between health care providers at a private facility in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires,ARCHIVOS ARGENTINOS DE PEDIATRIA,"Introduction. Failures in communication are common during patient handoffs between physicians, which predisposes to errors. Few articles have been published on this topic in Argentina. For this reason, our objective was to confirm whether using a structured handoff (I-PASS), which has been successfully used in the USA by Doctor Starmer, may reduce the omission of key data without prolonging its duration at our department. Population and methods. The study was conducted at a private facility in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires between June 15th, 2017 and March 31st, 2018. It had a quasi-experimental, uncontrolled, before-and-after design. Pre- and post-intervention handoffs were assessed. The intervention included training physicians on how to use a structured handoff mnemonic (I-PASS: illness severity, patient summary, action list, situation awareness and contingency planning, synthesis by receiver), training on team work, written computerized handoff document, feedback observations, and simulation. Results. A total of 158 and 124 pre- and post- intervention assessments were done respectively. The pre- and post-intervention comparison showed a significant improvement in most of the handoff key points. The time used for the handoff was 199 seconds (174-225) before the intervention and 210 seconds (190-230) after the intervention, p = 0.523; interruptions also decreased significantly. Conclusion. Introducing the I-PASS program reduced key data omission without prolonging handoffs. Interruptions were also reduced"
Economic Analysis of Anatomic Plating Versus Tubular Plating for the Treatment of Fibula Fractures,ORTHOPEDICS,"Ankle fractures are among the most common injuries requiring operative management. Implant choices include one-third tubular plates and anatomically precontoured plates. Although cadaveric studies have not revealed biomechanical differences between various plate constructs, there are substantial cost differences. This study sought to characterize the economic implications of implant choice. A retrospective review was undertaken of 201 consecutive patients with operatively treated OTA type 44B and 44C ankles. A Nationwide Inpatient Sample query was performed to estimate the incidence of ankle fractures requiring fibular plating, and a Monte Carlo simulation was conducted with the estimated at-risk US population for associated plate-specific costs. The authors estimated an annual incidence of operatively treated ankle fractures in the United States of 59,029. The average cost was $90.86 (95% confidence interval, $90.84-$90.87) for a one-third tubular plate vs $746.97 (95% confidence interval, $746.55-$747.39) for an anatomic plate. Across the United States, use of only one-third tubular plating over anatomic plating would result in statistically significant savings of $38,729,517 (95% confidence interval, $38,704,773-$38,754,261; P<.0001). General use of one-third tubular plating instead of anatomic plating whenever possible for fibula fractures could result in cost savings of up to nearly $40 million annually in the United States. Unless clinically justifiable on a per-case basis, or until the advent of studies showing substantial clinical benefit, there currently is no reason for the increased expense from widespread use of anatomic plating for fractures amenable to one-third tubular plating."
Preparation and in vivo efficient anti-infection property of GTR/GBR implant made by metronidazole loaded electrospun polycaprolactone nanofiber membrane,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS,"Infection is the major reason of GTR/GBR membrane failure in clinical application. In this work, we developed GTR/GBR nanofiber membranes with localized drug delivery function to prevent infection. Metronidazole (MNA), an antibiotic, was successfully incorporated into electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibers at different concentrations (0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 wt% polymer). To obtain the optimum anti-infection membrane, we systematically investigated the physical-chemical and mechanical properties of the nanofiber membranes with different drug contents. The interaction between PCL and MNA was identified by molecular dynamics simulation. MNA released in a controlled, sustained manner over 2 weeks and the antibacterial activity of the released MNA remained. The incorporation of MNA improved the hydrophilicity and in vitro biodegradation rate of PCL nanofibers. The nanofiber membranes allowed cells to adhere to and proliferate on them and showed excellent barrier function. The membrane loaded with 30% MNA had the best comprehensive properties. Analysis of subcutaneous implants demonstrated that MNA-loaded nanofibers evoked a less severe inflammatory response than pure PCL nanofibers. These results demonstrate the potential of MNA-loaded nanofiber membranes as GTR/GBR membrane with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory function for extensive biomedical applications.

Development of Knee Joint Robot for Students Becoming Therapists -Development of Training Program for Skill Attainment in Manual Therapy Techniques-,"2012 12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL, AUTOMATION AND SYSTEMS (ICCAS)","Students becoming physical therapists (PT) or occupational therapists (OT) cannot experience rehabilitation for actual patients' troubles before clinical training. For this reason we have developed the knee joint robot imitating patients' troubles such as range of motion trouble, contracture, rigidity, spasticity and so on. Therefore students can experience rehabilitation for patients' troubles virtually by using the robot. Moreover, from the standpoint of educational effect we have to develop a training program using the robot for the students to learn skilled manual therapy techniques for patients' troubles. In this paper, we propose a training program consisting of the monitoring system, the force display system, the supervisory system and the evaluation system. Firstly, we develop monitoring function in which the graphs of robot's angle, velocity and their appropriate values for training are displayed during training. Secondly, we develop simulation algorithms of clonus and hypertonia occurring in manual therapy. Lastly, we develop an evaluation method of manual therapy techniques for a patient with hypertonia."
Numerical analysis of blood flow in human abdominal aorta,ADVANCES IN FLUID MECHANICS VI,"A CFD model of flow hemodynamics in abdominal aortic aneurysm to estimate the effect of four different flow conditions on velocity and pressure profiles was developed and verified. The reconstruction of blood flow domain geometry was performed on the basis of CT examination. Our own software was used for CT image segmentation and real blood flow domain geometry reconstruction. Data necessary for determination of initial and boundary conditions as well as for verification of developed CFD model were collected from USG-Doppler examinations at 4 characteristic areas of the abdominal aorta. The result of these calculations proved that, irrespective of the applied boundary conditions and flow type, velocity profiles in all of the analysed models were similar. The comparison of theoretical and experimental results showed a significant difference in the absolute values of both velocities and heart-work period length. The reasons for the discrepancies were analyzed indicating both numerical factors and the character and accuracy of the USG examination."
Exploring the emergence and evolution of population patterns of leisure-time physical activity through agent-based modelling,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY,"Most interventions aiming to promote leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) at population level showed small or null effects. Approaching the problem from a systems science perspective may shed light on the reasons for these results. We developed an agent-based model to explore how the interactions between psychological attributes and built and social environments may lead to the emergence and evolution of LTPA patterns among adults. The modeling process consisted of four stages: (1) conceptual model development, (2) formulation of the agent-based model, (3) parametrization and calibration, and (4) consistency and sensitivity analyses. The model represents a stylized community containing two types of agents: persons and LTPA sites. Persons interact with each other (proximal network and perceived community) and with the built environment (LTPA sites) over time. Decision-making is based on the person's intention to practice LTPA, conditioned to the perceived environment. Each iteration is equivalent to one week and we assessed a period of 10 years. The model was able to reproduce population temporal trends of intention and LTPA reported in the literature. Sensitivity analyses indicated that population patterns and trends of intention and LTPA were highly influenced by the relationship between a person's behavior in the preceding week and his current intention, the person's access to built and social environment, and the density of LTPA sites. The proposed agent-based model is suitable to explore the emergence and evolution of LTPA patterns among adults, considering the dynamic interaction between individuals' psychological attributes and the built and social environments in which they live. The model is available at https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/J2KAS."
Motivational Factors and Training Aspects in Postgraduate Students of Anaesthesiology: A Survey,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC RESEARCH,"Introduction: Anaesthesiology is a fast growing branch of medicine. There is marked shortage of anaesthesiologists in India and this hinders the growth of surgical and interventional specialities which hinges on well-trained, enthusiastic anaesthesiology support. Exploring the perceptions about the speciality among Postgraduate (PG) students could help in planning strategies to make a career choice in anaesthesiology look more attractive. Aim: To explore the motivational factors for the choice of anaesthesiology for postgraduation, various aspects of PG training, stress among PGs and satisfaction with career choice in order to delineate the perceptions about the speciality among the medical graduates and to find out avenues for improvement to make the speciality more attractive. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional questionnairebased survey was distributed among 300 PG students in anaesthesiology who attended various national level conferences in India and state level conferences in Kerala between November 2015 and March 2018. Data collected was statistically analysed using R software version 3.1. All the quantitative variables were summarised as mean +/- SD (Standard Deviation) or median with IQR (Inter Quartile Range) depending on the distribution. Qualitative variables were summarised as proportions. Association between factors was analysed using Chi-square test or Fisher's-exact test. Results: Anaesthesiology was the first career preference for only 34.63% (n=88) of the participants. Predominant reasons for choosing anaesthesiology included unavailability of other specialities (32.8%, n=82) and good job opportunities without need of super specialisation (32%, n= 80). After joining anaesthesiology, majority (68%, n=175) were satisfied with their career choice. Satisfaction with PG training, assessed by the Likert scale was high among the participants and majority suggested improvements especially in theory classes, case discussions and simulation. Stress was experienced by 60% (n=154) of participants ascribed mainly due to lack of time for academics due to high workload. Conclusion: Improving awareness among public health professionals and medical students and increasing Undergraduate (UG) exposure to the subject would increase the proportion of students joining anaesthesiology with genuine interest and improve the recruitment profile. Modifications in training and measures to reduce stress during training should also be considered."
Matrix Components and Scaffolds for Sustained Islet Function,TISSUE ENGINEERING PART B-REVIEWS,"The clinical treatment of diabetes by islet transplantation is limited by low islet survival rates. A fundamental reason for this inefficiency is likely due to the removal of islets from their native environment. The isolation process not only disrupts interactions between blood vessels and endocrine cells, but also dramatically changes islet cell interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM). Biomolecular cues from the ECM are important for islet survival, proliferation, and function; however, very little is known about the composition of islet ECM and the role each component plays. Without a thorough understanding of islet ECM, current endeavors to prolong islet survival via scaffold engineering lack a systematic basis. The following article reviews current knowledge of islet ECM and attempts to explain the roles they play in islet function. In addition, the effects of in vitro simulations of the native islet scaffold will be evaluated. Greater understanding in these areas will provide a preliminary platform from which a sustainable bioartificial pancreas may be developed."
Sensitivity analyses for partially observed recurrent event data,PHARMACEUTICAL STATISTICS,"Recurrent events involve the occurrences of the same type of event repeatedly over time and are commonly encountered in longitudinal studies. Examples include seizures in epileptic studies or occurrence of cancer tumors. In such studies, interest lies in the number of events that occur over a fixed period of time. One considerable challenge in analyzing such data arises when a large proportion of patients discontinues before the end of the study, for example, because of adverse events, leading to partially observed data. In this situation, data are often modeled using a negative binomial distribution with time-in-study as offset. Such an analysis assumes that data are missing at random (MAR). As we cannot test the adequacy of MAR, sensitivity analyses that assess the robustness of conclusions across a range of different assumptions need to be performed. Sophisticated sensitivity analyses for continuous data are being frequently performed. However, this is less the case for recurrent event or count data. We will present a flexible approach to perform clinically interpretable sensitivity analyses for recurrent event data. Our approach fits into the framework of reference-based imputations, where information from reference arms can be borrowed to impute post-discontinuation data. Different assumptions about the future behavior of dropouts dependent on reasons for dropout and received treatment can be made. The imputation model is based on a flexible model that allows for time-varying baseline intensities. We assess the performance in a simulation study and provide an illustration with a clinical trial in patients who suffer from bladder cancer. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
Evaluation of the Standard Error of the Regression and Coefficient of Determination as goodness-of-fit parameters for Reverberant Shear Wave Elastography,2021 IEEE UFFC LATIN AMERICA ULTRASONICS SYMPOSIUM (LAUS),"Several studies of Reverberant shear wave elastography (R-SWE) have shown its potential for clinical applications. Previous studies of R-SWE present a shear wave speed (SWS) estimation based on a curve-fitting of the regression of Bessel functions to find the wavenumber. Recently, the coefficient of determination (R-2) was proposed as a goodness-of-fit (GoF) parameter, however, this parameter is not optimal for nonlinear fit according to the literature. For this reason, this study proposes the Standard error of the regression (S) as a (GoF). Numerical simulations were performed for 10 000 plane waves to produce a reverberant field. S and R-2 parameters were evaluated using a vibration frequency from 300 to 900 Hz with steps of 200 Hz. Besides, this study suggests a threshold value to reduce estimation error with S. Experiments showed negative values for R-2 even with 10 000 plane waves. Finally, a threshold of 0.15 for S reduced the bias and coefficient of variation, preserving a major percentage of information."
The role of menisci in knee contact mechanics and secondary kinematics during human walking,CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS,"Background: Meniscectomy is likely to result in an increase of joint loading on articular cartilage and initiates cartilage damages. However, the induced alterations in knee contact mechanics and secondary kinematics after the meniscal removal are still unclear during a walking gait. In this study, the role of menisci on the knee contact mechanics and secondary kinematics were investigated during a walking simulation. Methods: Two natural knee models with or without menisci were established using a musculoskeletal multibody dynamics framework. Walking simulation were performed to qualify the knee contact forces and secondary kinematics, and ligament forces in these models. Findings: After the meniscal removal, the redistributed contact forces on the medial tibial cartilage increased by twofold, while the contact area remained almost the same. The subsequent increase of contact pressure suggested potential cartilage damages. In terms of the kinematic alterations, the tibia moved more posteriorly and internally with respect to the femur. And, the displacement in the medial-lateral direction reversed. In addition, the sharp force increase in the anterior cruciate ligament explained the reason why meniscal and anterior cruciate ligament injuries always happened concurrently. And, the anterior lateral ligament may act as the stabilizer in the tibial posterior displacement and varus rotation. Interpretation: This study shows that menisci served as the joint load distribution, and also as the kinematics constraints in the posterior and medial-lateral direction, which is beneficial to the rehabilitation plan-making of meniscal injuries."
Iterative Outlier Removal: A Method for Identifying Outliers in Laboratory Recalibration Studies,CLINICAL CHEMISTRY,"BACKGROUND: Extreme values that arise for any reason, including those through nonlaboratory measurement procedure-related processes (inadequate mixing, evaporation, mislabeling), lead to outliers and inflate errors in reca-libration studies. We present an approach termed iterative outlier removal (IOR) for identifying such outliers. METHODS: We previously identified substantial laboratory drift in uric acid measurements in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study over time. Serum uric acid was originally measured in 1990-1992 on a Coulter DACOS instrument using an uricase-based measurement procedure. To recalibrate previous measured concentrations to a newer enzymatic colorimetric measurement procedure, uric acid was remeasured in 200 participants from stored plasma in 2011-2013 on a Beckman Olympus 480 autoanalyzer. To conduct IOR, we excluded data points >3 SDs from the mean difference. We continued this process using the resulting data until no outliers remained. RESULTS: IOR detected more outliers and yielded greater precision in simulation. The original mean difference (SD) in uric acid was 1.25 (0.62) mg/dL. After 4 iterations, 9 outliers were excluded, and the mean difference (SD) was 1.23 (0.45) mg/dL. Conducting only one round of outlier removal (standard approach) would have excluded 4 outliers [mean difference (SD) = 1.22 (0.51) mg/dL]. Applying the recalibration (derived from Deming regression) from each approach to the original measurements, the prevalence of hyperuricemia (>7 mg/dL) was 28.5% before IOR and 8.5% after IOR. CONCLUSIONS: IOR is a useful method for removal of extreme outliers irrelevant to recalibrating laboratory measurements, and identifies more extraneous outliers than the standard approach.

Boosting in Cox regression: a comparison between the likelihood-based and the model-based approaches with focus on the R-packages CoxBoost and mboost,COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS,"Despite the limitations imposed by the proportional hazards assumption, the Cox model is probably the most popular statistical tool used to analyze survival data, thanks to its flexibility and ease of interpretation. For this reason, novel statistical/machine learning techniques are usually adapted to fit its requirements, including boosting. Boosting is an iterative technique originally developed in the machine learning community to handle classification problems, and later extended to the statistical field, where it is used in many situations, including regression and survival analysis. The popularity of boosting has been further driven by the availability of user-friendly software such as the R packages mboost and CoxBoost, both of which allow the implementation of boosting in conjunction with the Cox model. Despite the common underlying boosting principles, these two packages use different techniques: the former is an adaptation of model-based boosting, while the latter adapts likelihood-based boosting. Here we contrast these two boosting techniques as implemented in the R packages from an analytic point of view; we further examine solutions adopted within these packages to treat mandatory variables, i.e. variables that-for several reasons-must be included in the model. We explore the possibility of extending solutions currently only implemented in one package to the other. A simulation study and a real data example are added for illustration."
Temperature-Induced Tissue Susceptibility Changes Lead to Significant Temperature Errors in PRFS-Based MR Thermometry During Thermal Interventions,MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE,"Proton resonance frequency shift-based MR thermometry (MRT) is hampered by temporal magnetic field changes. Temporal changes in the magnetic susceptibility distribution lead to nonlocal field changes and are, therefore, a possible source of errors. The magnetic volume susceptibility of tissue is temperature dependent. For water-like tissues, this dependency is in the order of 0.002 ppm/degrees C. For fat, it is in the same order of magnitude as the temperature dependence of the proton electron screening constant of water (0.01 ppm/degrees C). For this reason, proton resonance frequency shift-based MR thermometry in fatty tissues, like the human breast, is expected to be prone to errors. We aimed to quantify the influence of the temperature dependence of the susceptibility on proton resonance frequency shift-based MR thermometry. Heating experiments were performed in a controlled phantom set-up to show the impact of temperature-induced susceptibility changes on actual proton resonance frequency shift-based temperature maps. To study the implications for a clinical case, simulations were performed in a 3D breast model. Temperature errors were quantified by computation of magnetic field changes in the glandular tissue, resulting from susceptibility changes in a thermally heated region. The results of the experiments and simulations showed that the temperature-induced susceptibility changes of water and fat lead to significant errors in proton resonance frequency shift-based MR thermometry.

"Dawn of the digital diagnosis assisting system, can it open a new age for pathology?",MEDICAL IMAGING 2013: DIGITAL PATHOLOGY,"Digital pathology is developing based on the improvement and popularization of WSI (whole slide imaging) scanners. WSI scanners are widely expected to be used as the next generation microscope for diagnosis; however, their usage is currently mostly limited to education and archiving. Indeed, there are still many hindrances in using WSI scanners for diagnosis (not research purpose), two of the main reasons being the perceived high cost and small gain in productivity obtained by switching from the microscope to a WSI system and the lack of WSI standardization. We believe that a key factor for advancing digital pathology is the creation of computer assisted diagnosis systems (CAD). Such systems require high-resolution digitization of slides and provide a clear added value to the often costly conversion to WSI. We (NEC Corporation) are creating a CAD system, named e-Pathologist (R). This system is currently used at independent pathology labs for quality control (QC/QA), double-checking pathologists diagnosis and preventing missed cancers. At the end of 2012, about 80,000 slides, 200,000 tissues of gastric and colorectal samples will have been analyzed by e-Pathologist (R). Through the development of e-Pathologist (R), it has become clear that a computer program should be inspired by the pathologist diagnosis process, yet it should not be a mere copy or simulation of it. Indeed pathologists often approach the diagnosis of slides in a holistic manner, examining them at various magnifications, panning and zooming in a seemingly haphazard way that they often have a hard time to precisely describe. Hence there has been no clear recipe emerging from numerous interviews with pathologists on how to exactly computer code a diagnosis expert system. Instead, we focused on extracting a small set of histopathological features that were consistently indicated as important by the pathologists and then let the computer figure out how to interpret in a quantitative way the presence or absence of these features over the entire slide. Using the overall pathologists diagnosis (into a class of disease), we train the computer system using advanced machine learning techniques to predict the disease based on the extracted features. By considering the diagnosis of several expert pathologists during the training phase, we insure that the machine is learning a gold standard that will be applied consistently and objectively for all subsequent diagnosis, making them more predictable and reliable. Considering the future of digital pathology, it is essential for a CAD system to produce effective and accurate clinical data. To this effect, there remain many hurdles, including standardization as well as more research into seeking clinical evidences from computer-friendly objective measurements of histological images. Currently the most commonly used staining method is H&E (Hematoxylin and Eosin), but it is extremely difficult to standardize the H&E staining process. Current pathology criteria, category, definitions, and thresholds are all on based pathologists subjective observations. Digital pathology is an emerging field and researchers should bear responsibility not only for developing new algorithms, but also for understanding the meaning of measured quantitative data."
Useful lessons from body surface mapping,JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY,"Body surface potential maps (BSMs) depict the time varying distribution of cardiac potentials on the entice surface of the torso. Hundreds of studies have shown that BSMs contain more diagnostic and prognostic information than can be elicited from the 12-lead EGG. Despite these advantages, body surface mapping has not become a routinely used clinical method. One reason is that visual examination and sophisticated analysis of BSMs do not permit inferring the sequence of excitation and repolarization in the heart with a sufficient degree of certainty and detail. These limitations can be partially overcome by implementing inverse procedures that reconstruct epicardial potentials, isochrones, and ECGs from body surface measurements. Furthermore, ongoing experimental work and simulation studies show that a great deal of information about intramural events can be elicited from measured or reconstructed epicardial potential distributions. Interpreting epicardial data in terms of deep activity requires extensive knowledge of the architecture of myocardial fibers, their anisotropic properties, and the role of rotational anisotropy in affecting propagation and the associated potential fields."
Calculation of impingement-free combined cup and stem alignments based on the patient-specific pelvic tilt,JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS,"Proper cup alignment is crucial in total hip arthroplasty for reducing impingement risks, dislocations and wear. The Lewinnek safe zone is often used in clinical routine. This safe zone does not consider functional aspects and dislocation can occur even when the cup is oriented within the safe zone. Functional safe zones based on the hip range of motion (ROM) were introduced but are not commonly used in clinical routine. The reason might be that these methods are time-consuming due to complex simulations. A relatively fast method based on analytical mathematical formulas was proposed, but it is difficult to consider arbitrary motion. This work introduces an efficient algorithm for calculating a patient-specific target zone based on the target ROM which can consider any set of motions. The method is based on matrix transformations and trigonometric formulas. The resulting target zone which contains all impingement-free cup orientations is dependent on the patient-specific pelvic tilt, the 3D angular neck and stem orientation within the femur, and the technical prosthesis ROM. This method could be integrated into computer-assisted preoperative planning and intra-operative navigation tools. As pelvic tilt and stem orientation influence the optimal cup orientation they need to be acquired from the patient to derive a patient-specific ROM-based target zone. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

On the Feasibility of Breast Cancer Imaging Systems at Millimeter-Waves Frequencies,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES,"Medical imaging currently relies on several techniques, including X-rays, magnetic resonance, and echography. However, these techniques exhibit drawbacks, and alternative approaches are required. Microwave imaging has been proposed as a possible solution, especially for breast cancer imaging. However, most of these systems work with a central frequency of a few gigahertz, and this leads to a suboptimum resolution, which can jeopardize the image quality. Millimeter waves can provide superior resolutions, at the cost of a lower penetration depth within the breast tissue. In addition, a significant fraction of the power generated by a mm-wave imaging system would be reflected back from the skin. For these reasons, and also considering that mm-wave transmitters and receivers have been historically outperformed by microwave counterparts in terms of available power and sensitivity, mm-wave imaging has not been considered a possible solution. This paper contributes to demonstrate a paradigm shift toward the possible use of mm-waves for breast cancer imaging of targets a few centimeter below the skin, a useful penetration depth for several cases. All key points are addressed using analytical, full-wave, and multiphysics simulations, including the system architecture (linear and conformal), the safety aspects (power density, specific absorption rate, and temperature increase), and the use of realistic breast models derived from ex vivo measurements."
"Proinflammatory Secreted Phospholipase A2 Type IIA (sPLA-IIA) Induces Integrin Activation through Direct Binding to a Newly Identified Binding Site (Site 2) in Integrins alpha v beta 3, alpha 4 beta 1, and alpha 5 beta 1",JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY,"Background: Besides inside-out signaling, integrins are activated by the binding of fractalkine to a newly identified binding site (site 2). Results: sPLA2-IIA induced integrin activation through site 2. A peptide from site 2 or a small compound that binds to sPLA2-IIA suppressed the activation. Conclusion: sPLA2-IIA activates integrins through direct binding to site 2. Significance: Integrin activation through site 2 may be a potential therapeutic target in inflammation. Integrins are activated by signaling from inside the cell (inside-out signaling) through global conformational changes of integrins. We recently discovered that fractalkine activates integrins in the absence of CX3CR1 through the direct binding of fractalkine to a ligand-binding site in the integrin headpiece (site 2) that is distinct from the classical RGD-binding site (site 1). We propose that fractalkine binding to the newly identified site 2 induces activation of site 1 though conformational changes (in an allosteric mechanism). We reasoned that site 2-mediated activation of integrins is not limited to fractalkine. Human secreted phospholipase A2 type IIA (sPLA2-IIA), a proinflammatory protein, binds to integrins v3 and 41 (site 1), and this interaction initiates a signaling pathway that leads to cell proliferation and inflammation. Human sPLA2-IIA does not bind to M-type receptor very well. Here we describe that sPLA2-IIA directly activated purified soluble integrin v3 and transmembrane v3 on the cell surface. This activation did not require catalytic activity or M-type receptor. Docking simulation predicted that sPLA2-IIA binds to site 2 in the closed-headpiece of v3. A peptide from site 2 of integrin 1 specifically bound to sPLA2-IIA and suppressed sPLA2-IIA-induced integrin activation. This suggests that sPLA2-IIA activates v3 through binding to site 2. sPLA2-IIA also activated integrins 41 and 51 in a site 2-mediated manner. We recently identified small compounds that bind to sPLA2-IIA and suppress integrin-sPLA2-IIA interaction (e.g. compound 21 (Cmpd21)). Cmpd21 effectively suppressed sPLA2-IIA-induced integrin activation. These results define a novel mechanism of proinflammatory action of sPLA2-IIA through integrin activation."
Spatially adaptive denoising for X-ray cardiovascular angiogram images,BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL,"The X-ray angiogram image denoising is always one of the most popular research in the field of computer vision. While the methods removed the noise, the useful structure (such as peripheral vascular) had also been smoothed, the fundamental reason is that the denoising methods cannot efficiently distinguish structural areas from flat areas. In this paper, we have proposed a spatially adaptive image denoising (SAID) method which contains two steps: spatially adaptive gradient descent (SAGD) image denoising and dual-domain filter (DDF). The SAGD denoising method contains the following parts: first of all, the wavelet shrinkage method is used to estimate redundant information which is composed of the noise and useful structures; secondly, according to the characteristic of second order matrix, a spatially adaptive gradient factor (SAGF) has been constructed to distinguish the structure from flat areas; finally, the SAGF replaces the original gradient factor and then the SAGD image denoising method is formed. To further improve the quality of the SAGD image, the SAGD image is re-denoised by a modified DDF which is guided with a rotationally invariant non-local filter (RINLF) in spatial domain and gets structural details by wavelet shrinkage in frequency domain. The results of simulation experiments verify that the proposed SAID method can get well quantitative and qualitative results which are even superior to those using the state-of-the-art denoising methods. Even more, the fluctuation of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) value is very small with a small disturbance of SAGF, which illustrates that our algorithm is more robust than the prior progressive image denoising (PID) method. Moreover, the comparison results of the extensive experiments on clinical X-ray cardiovascular angiogram images further illustrate that our method can yield clearer cardiovascular images which can provide more useful vascular information for clinicians to analyze and diagnose the cardiovascular diseases.

Sample size considerations for matched-pair cluster randomization design with incomplete observations of binary outcomes,STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,"Multiple public health and medical research studies have applied matched-pair cluster randomization design to the evaluation of the intervention and/or prevention effects. One of the most common and severe problems faced by researchers when conducting cluster randomized trials (CRTs) is incomplete observations, which are associated with various reasons causing the individuals to discontinue participating in the trials. Although statistical methods to remedy the problems of missing data have already been proposed, there are still methodological gaps in research concerning the determination of sample size in matched-pair CRTs with incomplete binary outcomes. One conventional method for adjusting for missing data in the sample size determination is to divide the sample size under complete data by the expected follow-up rate. However, such crude adjustment ignores the impact of the structure and strength of correlations regarding both outcome data and missing data mechanism. This article provides a closed-form sample size formula for matched-pair CRTs with incomplete binary outcomes, which appropriately accounts for different missing patterns and magnitudes as well as the effects of matching and clustering on the outcome and missing data. The generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach treats incomplete observations as missing data in a marginal logistic regression model, which flexibly accommodates various types of intraclass correlation, missing patterns, and missing proportions. In the presence of missing data, the proposed GEE sample size method provides higher accuracy as compared with the conventional method. The performance of the proposed method is assessed by simulation studies. This article also illustrates how the proposed method can be used to design a real-world matched-pair CRT to examine the effect of a team-based approach on controlling blood pressure (BP)."
Toward Dynamic Prescribing Information: Codevelopment of Companion Model-Informed Precision Dosing Tools in Drug Development,CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY IN DRUG DEVELOPMENT,"Model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) is biosimulation in healthcare to predict the drug dose for a given patient based on their individual characteristics that is most likely to improve efficacy and/or lower toxicity compared with traditional dosing. Despite widespread use of biosimulation in drug development, MIPD has not been adopted beyond academic-hospital centers. A reason for this is that MIPD requires more supporting evidence in the language that everyday doctors understand-evidence-based medicine. In this commentary, codevelopment of companion MIPD tools during drug development is advocated as a way to accelerate the generation of the evidence required for broader clinical implementation of MIPD. Such tools have the potential to evolve into dynamic prescribing information that could guide dose selection for complex patients."
Statistical motor unit number estimation assuming a binomial distribution,MUSCLE & NERVE,"The statistical method of motor unit number estimation (MUNE) uses the natural stochastic variation in a muscle's compound response to electrical stimulation to obtain an estimate of the number of recruitable motor units. The current method assumes that this variation follows a Poisson distribution. We present an alternative that instead assumes a binomial distribution. Results of computer simulations and of a pilot study on 19 healthy subjects showed that the binomial MUNE values are considerably higher than those of the Poisson method, and in better agreement with the results of other MUNE techniques. In addition, simulation results predict that the performance in patients with severe motor unit loss will be better for the binomial than Poisson method. The adapted method remains closer to physiology, because it can accommodate the increase in activation probability that results from rising stimulus intensity. It does not need recording windows as used with the Poisson method, and is therefore less user-dependent and more objective and quicker in its operation. For these reasons, we believe that the proposed modifications may lead to significant improvements in the statistical MUNE technique."
Navigating the Regulatory Landscape to Develop Pediatric Oncology Drugs: Expert Opinion Recommendations,PEDIATRIC DRUGS,"Regulatory changes have been enacted in the United States (US) and European Union (EU) to encourage the development of new treatments for pediatric cancer. Here, we review some of the factors that have hampered the development of pediatric cancer treatments and provide a comparison of the US and EU regulations implemented to address this clinical need. We then provide some recommendations for each stage of the oncology drug development pathway to help researchers maximize their chance of successful drug development while complying with regulations. A key recommendation is the engagement of key stakeholders such as regulatory authorities, pediatric oncologists, academic researchers, patient advocacy groups, and a Pediatric Expert Group early in the drug development process. During drug target selection, sponsors are encouraged to consult the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the FDA target list, in addition to relevant US and European consortia that have been established to characterize and prioritize oncology drug targets. Sponsors also need to carefully consider the resourcing requirements for preclinical testing, which include ensuring appropriate access to the most relevant databases, clinical samples, and preclinical models (cell lines and animal models). During clinical development, sponsors can account for the pharmacodynamic (PD)/pharmacokinetic (PK) considerations specific to a pediatric population by developing pediatric formulations, selecting suitable PD endpoints, and employing sparse PK sampling or modeling/simulation of drug exposures where appropriate. Additional clinical considerations include the specific design of the clinical trial, the potential inclusion of children in adult trials, and the value of cooperative group trials. Plain Language Summary In the last few decades, great progress has been made in developing new treatments for adult cancers. However, development of new treatments for childhood cancers has been much slower. To encourage drug companies (sponsors) to develop effective treatments for childhood cancer, authorities in the United States (US) and Europe have made new rules for drug development. Under these new rules, sponsors developing drugs for specific cancers in adults have to consider whether the target of that drug also causes cancers in children. If this is the case, sponsors have to carry out clinical studies of their drug in children who have cancer that is caused by the same drug target. In this article, we describe some reasons for why drug development for childhood cancers has been slow and the rules created to address this problem in the US and Europe. We share some recommendations to help sponsors maximize their chances of developing an effective drug in children while satisfying the new rules. Specifically, sponsors need to be aware of the differences between studying drugs in adults versus children and how these influence the way the drug is tested. We make several recommendations for each stage of the development process, beginning with what is needed even before human studies begin. Finally, we highlight some issues that sponsors need to think about during drug development, from the preclinical stage (testing drugs in cells and animals) through to clinical testing in adults and pediatric patients with cancer."
Quantitative Hemodynamic Analysis of Brain Aneurysms at Different Locations,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Studies have shown that the occurrence of brain aneurysms and risk of rupture vary between locations. However, the reason that aneurysms at different branches of the cerebral arteries have different clinical presentations is not clear. Because research has indicated that aneurysm hemodynamics may be one of the important factors related to aneurysm growth and rupture, our aim was to analyze and compare the flow parameters in aneurysms at different locations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 24 patient-specific aneurysm models were constructed by using 3D rotational angiographic data for the hemodynamic simulation. Previously developed computational fluid dynamics software was applied to each aneurysm to simulate the blood-flow properties. Hemodynamic data at peak pulsatile flow were recorded, and wall shear stress (WSS) and flow rate in the aneurysms and parent arteries were quantitatively compared. To validate our method, a comparison with a previously reported technique was also performed. RESULTS: WSS and flow rate in the aneurysms at the peak of the cardiac cycle were found to differ in magnitude between different locations. Multiple comparisons among locations showed higher WSS and flow rate in middle cerebral artery aneurysms and lower WSS and flow rate in basilar artery and anterior communicating artery aneurysms. CONCLUSIONS: We observed changes in hemodynamic values that may be related to aneurysm location. Further study of aneurysm locations with a large number of cases is needed to test this hypothesis."
Model-based estimation of superinfection prevalence from limited datasets,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE,"Humans can be infected sequentially by different strains of the same virus. Estimating the prevalence of so-called 'superinfection' for a particular pathogen is vital because superinfection implies a failure of immunologic memory against a given virus despite past exposure, which may signal challenges for future vaccine development. Increasingly, viral deep sequencing and phylogenetic inference can discriminate distinct strains within a host. Yet, a population-level study may misrepresent the true prevalence of superinfection for several reasons. First, certain infections such as herpes simplex virus (HSV-2) only reactivate single strains, making multiple samples necessary to detect superinfection. Second, the number of samples collected in a study may be fewer than the actual number of independently acquired strains within a single person. Third, detecting strains that are relatively less abundant can be difficult, even for other infections such as HIV-1 where deep sequencing may identify multiple strains simultaneously. Here we develop a model of superinfection inspired by ecology. We define an infected individual's richness as the number of infecting strains and use ecological evenness to quantify the relative strain abundances. The model uses an EM methodology to infer the true prevalence of superinfection from limited clinical datasets. Simulation studies with known true prevalence are used to contrast our EM method to a standard (naive) calculation. While varying richness, evenness and sampling we quantify the accuracy and precision of our method. The EM method outperforms in all cases, particularly when sampling is low, and richness or unevenness is high. Here, sensitivity to our assumptions about clinical data is considered. The simulation studies also provide insight into optimal study designs; estimates of prevalence improve equally by enrolling more participants or gathering more samples per person. Finally, we apply our method to data from published studies of HSV-2 and HIV-1 superinfection."
Insight into the impact of EGFR L792Y/F/H mutations on sensitivity to osimertinib: an in silico study,NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY,"Osimertinib is the first third-generation epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, and it has been approved as a first-line medication for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Recently, the clinical use of osimertinib has revealed the emergence of new mutations, L792F, L792Y, and L792H (L792X), which endow lung cancer cells with the ability to escape drug inhibition. However, the binding mode between osimertinib and these mutants as well as the resistance mechanisms remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the inhibitory process associated with EGFR T790M (sensitive to osimertinib) and EGFR T790M/L792X (resistant to osimertinib) by modeling the recognition step and the dissociation step using an integrated computational approach. Using molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) free energy calculations, the results indicated that the L792X mutation from a hydrophobic amino acid to a hydrophilic amino acid might be the main reason for the difference in binding free energy of each mutant. Per-residue binding free energy decomposition analysis showed that the binding energy contribution of residues Met-793 and Gly-796, and the mutant residues, is most strongly affected by the L792X mutation. Moreover, umbrella sampling (US) simulations revealed that the resistance effect conferred by the L792X mutation is mainly caused by a decreased interaction between osimertinib and the hinge region of EGFR. Our research results provided new insights into drug resistance caused by the L792X mutation and gave valuable guidance for the development of more effective inhibitors."
Comparative pharmacodynamics of azithromycin and roxithromycin with S-pyogenes and S-pneumoniae in a model that simulates in vitro pharmacokinetics in human tonsils,JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL CHEMOTHERAPY,"Most macrolides penetrate and persist in peripheral tissues, irrespective of plasma concentrations. For this reason, comparative pharmacodynamics of macrolides might be better based on tissue rather than plasma pharmacokinetics. The present study compares the antimicrobial effects of azithromycin and roxithromycin on Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae using in vitro simulations of steady-state pharmacokinetics in human tonsils expected after a third 500 mg dose of azithromycin administered once a day and after a sixth 150 mg dose of roxithromycin administered twice a day. Clinical isolates of S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae (MICs 0.12 and 0.47 mg/L of azithromycin, and 0.15 and 0.60 mg/L of roxithromycin, respectively) were used. More pronounced antistreptococcal effects were observed with azithromycin than with roxithromycin. Despite similar rates of initial killing of S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, the respective 12 h areas between the control growth curve and the time-kill curve of antibiotic-exposed bacteria (ABBCs) were 22% and 36% greater with azithromycin than roxithromycin. Moreover, with azithromycin, viable bacterial counts reached the theoretically achievable limit of detection (10 cfu/mL) 8-10 h after drug administration, with no regrowth within 48 h. In contrast to azithromycin, S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae exposed to roxithromycin regrew 26 and 6 h, respectively, after initial reduction of the starting inoculum. Further in vitro simulations of tissue pharmacokinetics might be useful for pharmacodynamic comparisons among other macrolides."
Radiotherapy CT-based contouring atlas for non-malignant skeletal and soft tissue disorders: a practical proposal from Spanish experience,BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY,"Objective: Interest in low-dose radiotherapy (LD-RT) for the symptomatic treatment of nonmalignant conditions, including inflammatory and degenerative disorders of the joints and para-articular soft tissues, has increased substantially in recent years. In the present document, we provide a CT-based contouring atlas to help identify and delineate the most common osteoarticular regions susceptible to LD-RT. Methods: The clinical efficacy of LD-RT is supported by a large body of evidence. However, there is no consensus on the parameters for contouring the planning target volume (PTV). Moreover, 3D simulation and planning should be the standard of care even for nonmalignant disorders. For this reason, the present guidelines were prepared to help guide PTV contouring based on CT images, with the same quality criteria for patient immobilization, treatment simulation, planning and delivery as those routinely applied for cancer radiotherapy. Results: PTV for radiotherapy requires precise identification of the target areas based on CT and other imaging techniques. Using a series of cases treated at our institution, we have defined the PTVs for each location on the simulation CT to establish the relationship between the image and the anatomical structures to be treated. We also specify the immobilization systems used to ensure treatment accuracy and reproducibility. Conclusions: This comprehensive atlas based on CT images may be of value to radiation oncologists who wish to use LD-RT for the symptomatic treatment of degenerative or inflammatory osteoarticular diseases. Advances in knowledge: The recommendations and contouring atlas described in this article provide an eminently practical tool for LD-RT in non-malignant conditions, based on the same quality criteria recommended for all modern radiotherapy treatments in Spain."
Small studies are more heterogeneous than large ones: a meta-meta-analysis,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY,"Objectives: Between-study heterogeneity plays an important role in random-effects models for meta-analysis. Most clinical trials are small, and small trials are often associated with larger effect sizes. We empirically evaluated whether there is also a relationship between trial size and heterogeneity (tau). Study Design and Setting: We selected the first meta-analysis per intervention review of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Issues 2009-2013 with a dichotomous (n = 2,009) or continuous (n = 1,254) outcome. The association between estimated tau and trial size was evaluated across meta-analyses using regression and within meta-analyses using a Bayesian approach. Small trials were predefined as those having standard errors (SEs) over 0.2 standardized effects. Results: Most meta-analyses were based on few (median 4) trials. Within the same meta-analysis, the small study tau(2)(S) was larger than the large-study tau(2)(L) [average ratio 2.11; 95% credible interval (1.05, 3.87) for dichotomous and 3.11 (2.00, 4.78) for continuous meta-analyses]. The imprecision of tau(S) was larger than of tau(L): median SE 0.39 vs. 0.20 for dichotomous and 0.22 vs. 0.13 for continuous small-study and large-study meta-analyses. Conclusion: Heterogeneity between small studies is larger than between larger studies. The large imprecision with which tau is estimated in a typical small-studies' meta-analysis is another reason for concern, and sensitivity analyses are recommended. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Teaching pediatrics to residents via conventional lectures in France: A national survey from students,ARCHIVES DE PEDIATRIE,"Objective. To assess the point of view of young physicians training in pediatrics in France on their theoretical courses during residency. Methods. A free-access electronic anonymous survey was sent three times by e-mail to the 1215 residents in pediatrics, from July to October 2015. Results. Fifty-seven percent of French residents in pediatrics responded to the survey. It was established that they took part in six (range, 3-10) half-days of specific theoretical teaching in pediatrics from November 2014 to mid-April 2015. Only 54% participated in more than 75% of regional theoretical training. The main self declared reason for their absence was that they could not leave their clinical activities. Fifty-three per cent of the residents took partin additional training, 45% of them because they found the primary theoretical training insufficient. The overall quality of the theoretical teaching was rated 5 (range, 3-7) out of 10. Eighty-five percent of residents expected to be evaluated on their knowledge during their residency. Conclusion. In pediatrics, additional training is individually undertaken because they deemed their initial training insufficient during their residency. An evaluation of knowledge is requested by residents. The reform of the national residency program must take into account these results in redesigning the theoretical training in pediatrics, integrating innovative teaching techniques to daily practice, for example.

Vessel orientation-dependent sensitivity of optoacoustic imaging using a linear array transducer,JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS,"For clinical optoacoustic imaging, linear probes are preferably used because they allow versatile imaging of the human body with real-time display and free-hand probe guidance. The two-dimensional (2-D) optoacoustic image obtained with this type of probe is generally interpreted as a 2-D cross-section of the tissue just as is common in echo ultrasound. We demonstrate in three-dimensional simulations, phantom experiments, and in vivo mouse experiments that for vascular imaging this interpretation is often inaccurate. The cylindrical blood vessels emit anisotropic acoustic transients, which can be sensitively detected only if the direction of acoustic radiation coincides with the probe aperture. Our results reveal for this reason that the signal amplitude of different blood vessels may differ even if the vessels have the same diameter and initial pressure distribution but different orientation relative to the imaging plane. This has important implications for the image interpretation, for the probe guidance technique, and especially in cases when a quantitative reconstruction of the optical tissue properties is required.

Analytical approach to determine the rotational freedom of dental implant-abutment connections,4TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"Two-piece dental implants consist of the implant and the abutment, which is carrying the superstructure or prosthesis. Their design allows very flexible configurations, making them the commonly used system. The implant-abutment connection has to ensure a repeatable, accurate alignment of the abutment, as many repositionings are needed during the process of installing the superstructure. Any misalignment leads to unintended stress within the final assembly, which eventually might be responsible for subsequent complications. For this reason, these designs contain an anti-rotation-lock. In this paper the influence of the geometric shape of the anti-rotation-lock on the freedom of rotation is being investigated by analytical means. Closed-form formulas are developed for the common polygonal forms and the tri-channel Replace Select (R) system. For more uncommon shapes like the Camlog (R) system a general approach is pursued, which is based on the underlying parameter responsible for the rotational freedom. The extend of the calculated rotational freedom of several anti-rotation-locks of different manufacturers is shown and that it is in particular depending on its shape, its size and the gap between implant and abutment, resulting from the fabrication clearance of the manufacturer. All results are verified and illustrated by 3D-Cad-Simulations, which are based on precise measurements of the implant-abutment systems. Further discussion reveals the best possible two dimensional shape with respect to a minimized rotational freedom and compares its capability with the abutments of several commonly used implant-abutment systems."
Synthetic Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography Images for Use in Perceptual Studies,SEMINARS IN NUCLEAR MEDICINE,"To better understand fundamental issues, perception studies of the fusion display would best be performed with a panel of lesions of variable location, size, intensity, and background. There are compelling reasons to use synthetic images that contain artificial lesions for perception research. A consideration of how to obtain this panel of lesions is the nucleus of the present review. This article is a conjoint effort of 3 groups that have joined together to review results from work that they and others have performed. The techniques we review include (1) substitution of lesions into a preexisting image matrix (either using actual prior patient-derived lesions or mathematically modeled artificial lesions), (2) addition of images (either in the attenuation-corrected image space or at an earlier stage before image reconstruction), and (3) simulation of the entire patient image. A judicious combination of the techniques discussed in this review may represent the most efficient pathway of simulating statistically varied but realistic appearing lesions.

An Attempt to Predict the Proton Relative Biological Effectiveness using Radical Recombination,"WORLD CONGRESS ON MEDICAL PHYSICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, 2015, VOLS 1 AND 2","Most proton treatment facilities have adopted a relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of 1.1 for proton therapy. However, most of the in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that the RBE of the spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) protons increases with depth. The increase in RBE of proton beams on the SOBP is a well-known phenomenon that is difficult to quantify accurately in vivo studies. The reason for this explains that the RBE increases as linear energy transfer (LET) increases within the SOBP. The fact that intra-track radical recombination can indicate to produce fully competent lesions in room. The purpose of this study was to analyze an impact on radical recombination for the RBE in the SOBP proton beams. First, a depth-dose curve for the 210 MeV proton beam measured using a gel dosimeter and an ionization chamber. Second, the spatial distribution of the physical dose was calculated by Monte Carlo code system PHITS; the role of nuclear interaction was taken into account and the geometry of the apparatus was faithfully reproduced. The simulation results were compared with measured the depth-dose distribution and very good agreement was found, and the spatial distribution of an LET-weighted dose with threshold LET value (4.9 keV/mu m) was calculated by the same code. Then, the relative distribution of the radical-recombination was calculated from the physical dose and LET-weighted dose. The relative distribution of the radical-recombination was calculated at each depth as the quotient of relative dose obtained using physical and LET-weighted dose. The agreement between the relative distributions of radical-recombination and RBE was good at the SOBP."
IMRT optimization including random and systematic geometric errors based on the expectation of TCP and NTCP,MEDICAL PHYSICS,"The purpose of this work was the development of a probabilistic planning method with biological cost functions that does not require the definition of margins. Geometrical uncertainties were integrated in tumor control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) 14 objective functions for inverse planning. For efficiency reasons random errors were included by blurring the dose distribution and systematic errors by shifting structures with respect to the dose. Treatment plans were made for 19 prostate patients following four inverse strategies: Conformal with homogeneous dose to the planning target volume (PTV), a simultaneous integrated boost using a second PTV, optimization using TCP and NTCP functions together with a PTV, and probabilistic TCP and NTCP optimization for the clinical target volume without PTV. The resulting plans were evaluated by independent Monte Carlo simulation of many possible treatment histories including geometrical uncertainties. The results showed that the probabilistic optimization technique reduced the rectal wall volume receiving high dose, while at the same time increasing the dose to the clinical target volume. Without sacrificing the expected local control rate, the expected rectum toxicity could be reduced by 50% relative to the boost technique. The improvement over the conformal technique was larger yet. The margin based biological technique led to toxicity in between the boost and probabilistic techniques, but its control rates were very variable and relatively low. During evaluations, the sensitivity of the local control probability to variations in biological parameters appeared similar for all four strategies. The sensitivity to variations of the geometrical error distributions was strongest for the probabilistic technique. It is concluded that probabilistic optimization based on tumor control probability and normal tissue complication probability is feasible. It results in robust prostate treatment plans with an improved balance between local control and rectum toxicity, compared to conventional techniques.

Monte Carlo calculation of quality correction factors based on air kerma and absorbed dose to water in medium energy x-ray beams,PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,"Clinical dosimetry is typically performed using ion chambers calibrated in terms of absorbed dose to water. As primary measurement standards for this quantity for low and medium energy x-rays are available only since a few years, most dosimetry protocols for this photon energy range are still based on air kerma calibration. For that reason, data for beam quality correction factors k(Q,Q0), necessary for the application of dose to water based protocols, are scarce in literature. Currently the international IAEA TRS-398 Code of Practice is under revision and new k(Q,Q0) factors for a large number of ion chambers will be introduced in the update of this protocol. Several international groups provided the IAEA with experimental and Monte Carlo based data for this revision. Within the European Community the EURAMET 16NRM03 RTNORM project was initiated for that purpose. In the present study, Monte Carlo based results for the beam quality correction factors in medium energy x-ray beams for six ion chambers applying different Monte Carlo codes are presented. Additionally, the perturbation factor p(Q), necessary for the calculation of dose to water from an air kerma calibration coefficient, was determined. The beam quality correction factor k(Q,Q0) for the chambers varied in the investigated energy range by about 4%-5%, and for five out of six chambers the data could be fitted by a simple logarithmic function, if the half-value-layer was used as the beam quality specifier. Corresponding data using different Monte Carlo codes for the same ion chamber agreed within 0.5%. For the perturbation factor p(Q), the data did not obey a comparable simple relationship with the beam quality specifier. The variation of p(Q) for all ion chambers was in the range of 3%-4%. Compared to recently published data, our p(Q) data is around 1% larger, although the same Monte Carlo code has been used. Compared to the latest experimental data, there are even deviations in the range of 2%."
FUNCTIONAL PERFORMANCE-MEASURES - ARE THEY SUPERIOR TO SELF-ASSESSMENTS,JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY,"Background. It has been suggested that performance measures of functional status have several advantages over self-report measures for both clinical and research purposes, including: greater patient acceptability, interpretability, reproducibility, sensitivity to change, and the focus on actual ability rather than presumed capability. This article challenges this assumed superiority of ''objective ... .. behavioral'' measures by directly comparing self-assessments and blindly rated performance assessments on a specific item by task basis, using an identical rating format. Methods. A set of 14 performance tasks, consisting of a range of functional abilities (including simulations of cooking and sweeping), was administered to 99 community-dwelling older adults (aged 60-92) who had previously completed a 50-item instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) questionnaire. A subsample was retested 2 weeks later, and reassessed at 1 year. Results. Of 182 subjects willing and able to complete the IADL questionnaire, only 99 attempted at least one of the performance tasks. Tasks that took longer to complete were not necessarily associated with a greater number of errors, nor did accuracy ratings correspond well with difficulty ratings. Good correspondence (greater than 80% agreement) between observed and perceived difficulty was found for only one-third of the item/task matchings. Generally, the rater tended to underestimate difficulty relative to subjective assessments. Conclusions. Relative to questionnaires, performance measures were not found to be psychometrically superior, more acceptable to respondents, easier to administer, or easier to interpret. Neither type of measure by itself distinguishes between motivation and capability, reflects adaptations made in everyday living, or accounts for personal preferences or reasons for difficulty."
On a PCA-based lung motion model,PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,"Respiration-induced organ motion is one of the major uncertainties in lung cancer radiotherapy and is crucial to be able to accurately model the lung motion. Most work so far has focused on the study of the motion of a single point (usually the tumor center of mass), and much less work has been done to model the motion of the entire lung. Inspired by the work of Zhang et al (2007 Med. Phys. 34 4772-81), we believe that the spatiotemporal relationship of the entire lung motion can be accurately modeled based on principle component analysis (PCA) and then a sparse subset of the entire lung, such as an implanted marker, can be used to drive the motion of the entire lung (including the tumor). The goal of this work is twofold. First, we aim to understand the underlying reason why PCA is effective for modeling lung motion and find the optimal number of PCA coefficients for accurate lung motion modeling. We attempt to address the above important problems both in a theoretical framework and in the context of real clinical data. Second, we propose a new method to derive the entire lung motion using a single internal marker based on the PCA model. The main results of this work are as follows. We derived an important property which reveals the implicit regularization imposed by the PCA model. We then studied the model using two mathematical respiratory phantoms and 11 clinical 4DCT scans for eight lung cancer patients. For the mathematical phantoms with cosine and an even power (2n) of cosine motion, we proved that 2 and 2n PCA coefficients and eigenvectors will completely represent the lung motion, respectively. Moreover, for the cosine phantom, we derived the equivalence conditions for the PCA motion model and the physiological 5D lung motion model (Low et al 2005 Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 63 921-9). For the clinical 4DCT data, we demonstrated the modeling power and generalization performance of the PCA model. The average 3D modeling error using PCA was within 1 mm (0.7 +/- 0.1 mm). When a single artificial internal marker was used to derive the lung motion, the average 3D error was found to be within 2 mm (1.8 +/- 0.3 mm) through comprehensive statistical analysis. The optimal number of PCA coefficients needs to be determined on a patient-by-patient basis and two PCA coefficients seem to be sufficient for accurate modeling of the lung motion for most patients. In conclusion, we have presented thorough theoretical analysis and clinical validation of the PCA lung motion model. The feasibility of deriving the entire lung motion using a single marker has also been demonstrated on clinical data using a simulation approach."
The Educational Efficacy of Humane Teaching Methods: A Systematic Review of the Evidence,ANIMALS,"Simple Summary Despite the fact that there are currently many humane teaching methods available, harmful animal use in education and training remains widespread among life and health sciences disciplines. The use of humane teaching methods instead is based not only on legal, ethical, and economic factors, but also on evidence that these training techniques are just as efficient or even better in improving knowledge, understanding, and clinical or surgical skills proficiency among students. However, studies systematically comparing the learning outcomes of both harmful animal use and humane teaching methods are more than a decade old, and the evidence needs to be updated. Here, we assess and summarize the currently available studies through the process of a systematic review. We found 50 relevant studies and established that in 90% of studies humane teaching methods were as or more effective than harmful animal use in achieving desired learning outcomes. These results are clear-there is no valid educational reason for continued harmful animal use in education and training. Humane alternatives to harmful educational animal use include ethically-sourced cadavers, models, mannequins, mechanical simulators, videos, computer and virtual reality simulations, and supervised clinical and surgical experiences. In many life and health sciences courses, however, traditional animal use persists, often due to uncertainty about the educational efficacy of humane alternatives. The most recent comprehensive reviews assessing learning outcomes of humane teaching methods, in comparison to harmful animal use, were published more than 10 years ago. Therefore, we aimed to collate and analyse the combined evidence from recent and older studies about the efficacy of humane teaching methods. Using specific search terms, we systematically searched the Web of Science, SCOPUS, and EMBASE databases for relevant educational studies. We extracted information on publication years, the country in which the study was conducted, field, humane teaching methods, form of learning outcome assessment, and the learning outcome of the humane teaching methods, in comparison with harmful animal use. We found 50 relevant studies published from 1968-2020, primarily stemming from the USA, UK, and Canada. Humane teaching methods produced learning outcomes superior (30%), equivalent (60%), or inferior (10%) to those produced by traditional harmful animal use. In conclusion, a wide-spread implementation of humane teaching methods would not only preserve learning outcomes, but may in fact be beneficial for animals, students, educators, and institutions."
The binomial distribution of meta-analysis was preferred to model within-study variability,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY,"Objective: When studies report proportions such as sensitivity or specificity, it is customary to meta-analyze them using the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model. This method approximates the within-study variability of the proportion by a normal distribution, which may lead to bias for several reasons. Alternatively an exact likelihood approach based on the binomial within-study distribution can be used. This method can easily be performed in standard statistical packages. We investigate the performance of the standard method and the alternative approach. Study Design and Setting: We compare the two approaches through a simulation study, in terms of bias, mean-squared error, and coverage probabilities. We varied the size of the overall sensitivity or specificity, the between-studies variance, the within-study sample sizes, and the number of studies. The methods are illustrated using a published meta-analysis data set. Results: The exact likelihood approach performs always better than the approximate approach and gives unbiased estimates. The coverage probability, in particular for the profile likelihood, is also reasonably acceptable. In contrast, the approximate approach gives huge bias with very poor coverage probability in many cases. Conclusion: The exact likelihood approach is the method of preference and should be used whenever feasible. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Cementless Ceramic-on-Ceramic Total Hip Replacement in Children and Adolescents,CHILDREN-BASEL,"Background: total hip replacement (THR) is a rare surgical option in children and adolescents with disabling hip diseases. The aim of this study is to report results from a retrospective cohort of patients aged 18 years or less who underwent cementless Ceramic-on-Ceramic (CoC) THR at a single institution, investigating clinical and radiographic outcomes, survival rates, and reasons for revision of the implants. Materials and methods: we queried the Registry of Prosthetic Orthopedic Implants (RIPO) to identify all children and adolescents undergoing THR between 2000 and 2019 at a single Institution. Inclusion criteria were patients undergoing cementless CoC THR, aged less than 18 years at surgery, followed for at least 2 years. Sixty-eight patients (74 hips) matched all the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. We assessed the clinical and radiographic outcomes, the rate of complications, the survival rate, and reasons for revision of the implants. Results: The mean follow-up was 6.6 & PLUSMN; 4.4 years (range 2-20). The most frequent reason for THR was post-traumatic or chemotherapy-induced avascular necrosis (38%). The overall survival rate of the cohort was 97.6% (95% CI: 84.9-99.7%) at 5 years of follow-up, 94.4% (95% CI: 79.8-98.6%) at 10 years and 15 years of follow-up. Two THR in two patients (2.7%) required revision. With the numbers available, Cox regression analysis could not detect any significant interaction between preoperative or intraoperative variables and implant survivorship (p-value 0.242 to 0.989).  The average HOOS was 85 & PLUSMN; 14.3 (range 30.6-100). Overall, 23 patients (48%) reported excellent HOOS scores (> 90 points), 21 patients (44%) reported acceptable HOOS scores (60-90 points) while 4 patients (8%) reported poor outcomes (< 60 points). Twenty-one patients (43%) were regularly involved into moderate- to high-intensity sport activities (UCLA & GE; 6). Conclusions: Cementless CoC THR is a successful procedure in children and teenagers, having demonstrated high implant survivorship and low rates of complications and failure. A meticulous preoperative planning and implant selection is mandatory, to avoid implant malposition, which is the main reason of failure and revision in these cases. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of the THR on the psychosocial wellbeing of teenagers, as well as risks and benefits and cost-effectiveness in comparison to the hip preserving surgical procedures.</p>"
Suppression of interictal spikes during phasic rapid eye movement sleep: a quantitative stereo-electroencephalography study,JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH,"Tonic and phasic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep seem to represent two different brain states exerting different effects on epileptic activity. In particular, interictal spikes are suppressed strongly during phasic REM sleep. The reason for this effect is not understood completely. A different level of synchronization in phasic and tonic REM sleep has been postulated, yet never measured directly. Here we assessed the interictal spike rate across non-REM (NREM) sleep, phasic and tonic REM sleep in nine patients affected by drug resistant focal epilepsy: five with type II focal cortical dysplasia and four with hippocampal sclerosis. Moreover, we applied different quantitative measures to evaluate the level of synchronization at the local and global scale during phasic and tonic REM sleep. We found a lower spike rate in phasic REM sleep, both within and outside the seizure onset zone. This effect seems to be independent from the histopathological substrate and from the brain region, where epileptic activity is produced (temporal versus extra-temporal). A higher level of synchronization was observed during tonic REM sleep both on a large (global) and small (local) spatial scale. Phasic REM sleep appears to be an interesting model for understanding the mechanisms of suppression of epileptic activity."
"Improving patient safety in the operating theatre and perioperative care: obstacles, interventions, and priorities for accelerating progress",BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA,"The publication of To Err Is Human in the USA and An Organisation with a Memory in the UK more than a decade ago put patient safety firmly on the clinical and policy agenda. To date, however, progress in improving safety and outcomes of hospitalized patients has been slower than the authors of these reports had envisaged. Here, we first review and analyse some of the reasons for the lack of evident progress in improving patient safety across healthcare specialities. We then focus on what we believe is a critical part of the healthcare system that can contribute to safety but also to errorhealthcare teams. Finally, we review team training interventions and tools available for the assessment and improvement of team performance and we offer recommendations based on the existing evidence-base that have potential to improve patient safety and outcomes in the coming decade."
Age and gender dependent heart rate circadian model development and performance verification on the proarrhythmic drug case study,THEORETICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICAL MODELLING,"Background: There are two main reasons for drug withdrawals at the various levels of the development path - hepatic and cardiac toxicity. The latter one is mainly connected with the proarrhythmic potency and according to the present practice is supposed to be recognized at the pre-clinical (in vitro and animal in vivo) or clinical level (human in vivo studies). There are, although, some limitations to all the above mentioned methods which have led to novel in vitro - in vivo extrapolation methods being introduced. With the use of in silico implemented mathematical and statistical modelling it is possible to translate the in vitro findings into the human in vivo situation at the population level. Human physiology is influenced by many parameters and one of them which needs to be properly accounted for is a heart rate which follows the circadian rhythm. We described such phenomenon statistically which enabled the improved assessment of the drug proarrhythmic potency. Methods: A publicly available data set describing the circadian changes of the heart rate of 18 healthy subjects, 5 males (average age 36, range 26-45) and 13 females (average age 34, range 20-50) was used for the heart rate model development. External validation was done with the use of a clinical research database containing heart rate measurements derived from 67 healthy subjects, 34 males and 33 females (average age 33, range 17-72). The developed heart rate model was then incorporated into the ToxComp platform to simulate the impact of circadian variation in the heart rate on QTc interval. The usability of the combined models was assessed with moxifloxacin (MOXI) as a model drug. Results: The developed heart rate model fitted well, both to the training data set (RMSE = 128 ms and MAPE = 12.3%) and the validation data set (RMSE = 165 ms and MAPE = 17.1%). Simulations performed at the population level proved that the combination of the IVIVE platform and the population variability description allows for the precise prediction of the circadian variation of drugs proarrhythmic effect. Conclusions: It can be concluded that a flexible and practically useful model describing the heart rate circadian variation has been developed and its performance was verified."
Automated auditory response detection: Statistical problems with repeated testing,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUDIOLOGY,"Sequential application of a statistical test is usually applied in an automated auditory response detection algorithm. The sequential test strategy is very time-efficient but increases the probability of a false rejection of the null-hypothesis. For this reason. it is necessary to correct the critical test value. However, the well-known Bonferroni correction leads to an over-correction when dealing with dependent or partly dependent data. The objective of the study reported here was to develop a method to determine the critical test value for the sequential testing of dependent data. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations were used to develop this method. The simulation results were reviewed and the benefit of the suggested method, in comparison to the Bonferroni correction, was shown using a large sample of real amplitude modulation following response data. The detection rate determined for these data and the ROC curve demonstrate the advantage of using the method suggested here."
Subgroup discovery in non-inferiority trials,STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,"Approaches and guidelines for performing subgroup analysis to assess heterogeneity of treatment effect in clinical trials have been the topic of numerous papers in the statistical and clinical literature, but have been discussed predominantly in the context of conventional superiority trials. Concerns about treatment heterogeneity are the same if not greater in non-inferiority (NI) trials, especially since overall similarity between two treatment arms in a successful NI trial could be due to the existence of qualitative interactions that are more likely when comparing two active therapies. Even in unsuccessful NI trials, subgroup analyses can yield important insights about the potential reasons for failure to demonstrate non-inferiority of the experimental therapy. Recent NI trials have performed a priori subgroup analyses using standard statistical tests for interaction, but there is increasing interest in more flexible machine learning approaches for post-hoc subgroup discovery. The performance and practical application of such methods in NI trials have not been systematically explored, however. We considered the Virtual Twin method for the NI setting, an algorithm for subgroup identification that combines random forest with classification and regression trees, and conducted extensive simulation studies to examine its performance under different NI trial conditions and to devise decision rules for selecting the final subgroups. We illustrate the utility of the method with data from a NI trial that was conducted to compare two acupuncture treatments for chronic musculoskeletal pain."
"Comparison of the risk difference, risk ratio and odds ratio scales for quantifying the unadjusted intervention effect in cluster randomized trials",STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,"This paper evaluates methods for unadjusted analyses of binary outcomes in cluster randomized trials (CRTs). Under the generalized estimating equations (GEE) method the identity, log and logit link functions may be specified to make inferences on the risk difference, risk ratio and odds ratio scales, respectively. An alternative, 'cluster-level', method applies the t-test to summary statistics calculated for each cluster, using proportions, log proportions and log odds, to make inferences on the respective scales. Simulation was used to estimate the bias of the unadjusted intervention effect estimates and confidence interval coverage, generating data sets with different combinations of number of clusters, number of participants per cluster, intra-cluster correlation coefficient rho and intervention effect. When the identity link was specified, GEE had little bias and good coverage, performing slightly better than the log and logit link functions. The cluster-level method provided unbiased point estimates when proportions were used to summarize the clusters. When the log proportion and log odds were used, however, the method often had markedly large bias for two reasons: (i) bias in the modified summary statistic used for cluster-level estimation when a cluster has zero cases with the outcome of interest (arising when the number of participants sampled per cluster is small and the outcome prevalence is low) and (ii) asymptotically, the method estimates the ratio of geometric means of the cluster proportions or odds, respectively, between the trial arms rather than the ratio of arithmetic means.

A new method of estimating the distribution of muscle fiber conduction velocities,ELECTROMYOGRAPHY AND MOTOR CONTROL-ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY AND CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY,"A computer-assisted method of estimating the distribution of muscle fiber conduction velocities is described. An electrode array composed of 2 stimulating and 4 recording electrodes is used to record surface muscle action potentials (MAPs) in response to diner muscle stimulation. The velocity distribution and the single muscle fiber action potential (SFAP) are calculated from the recorded MAPs by an iterative method of estimation. The estimation is based on the assumption that the spatial orientation of each muscle fiber viewed from the recording electrodes is the same along the muscle fibers and a MAP is recorded as a linear summation of all SFAPs. The accuracy of this estimation is demonstrated using simulated MAPs. The method is also tested on MAPs containing simulated amplifier noise, stimulus artifact, and errors in distance between electrodes. Finally we applied this method to MAP recordings of the biceps brachii in 23 healthy subjects. The velocity distribution was successfully estimated in 20 cases. The average of the estimated distributions was smaller than that described by previous workers. The reasons for the difference are discussed."
Cardiac Rhythm and Molecular Docking Studies of Ion Channel Ligands with Cardiotoxicity in Zebrafish,CELLS,"Safety is one of the most important and critical issues in drug development. Many drugs were abandoned in clinical trials and retracted from the market because of unknown side effects. Cardiotoxicity is one of the most common reasons for drug retraction due to its potential side effects, i.e., inducing either tachycardia, bradycardia or arrhythmia. The zebrafish model could be used to screen drug libraries with potential cardiotoxicity in a high-throughput manner. In addition, the fundamental principles of replacement, reduction, and refinement of laboratory animal usage, 3R, could be achieved by using zebrafish as an alternative to animal models. In this study, we used a simple ImageJ-based method to evaluate and screen 70 ion channel ligands and successfully identify six compounds with strong cardiotoxicity in vivo. Next, we conducted an in silico-based molecular docking simulation to elucidate five identified compounds that might interact with domain III or domain IV of the Danio rerio L-type calcium channel (LTCC), a known pharmaceutically important target for arrhythmia. In conclusion, in this study, we provide a web lab and dry lab combinatorial approach to perform in vivo cardiotoxicity drug screening and in silico mechanistic studies."
Analyzing pre-post designs using the analysis of covariance models with and without the interaction term in a heterogeneous study population,STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH,"Pre-post parallel group randomized designs have been frequently used to compare the effectiveness of competing treatment strategies and the ordinary least squares (OLS)-based analysis of covariance model (ANCOVA) is a routine analytic approach. In many scenarios, the associations between the baseline and the post-randomization scores could differ between the treatment and control arms, which justifies the inclusion of the treatment by baseline score interaction in ANCOVA. This heterogeneity may also cause heteroscedastic errors in ANCOVA. In this study, we compared the performances of the ANCOVA models with and without the interaction term in estimating the marginal treatment effect in a heterogeneous two-arm pre-post design. We explored the relationship between the two nested ANCOVA models from the perspective of an omitted variable bias problem and further revealed the reasons why the usual ANCOVA may fail in heterogeneous scenario through the discussion of the three types of variances associated with the ANCOVA estimators of the marginal treatment effect: the target unconditional variance, the conditional variance allowing unequal error variances, and the OLS conditional variance derived under the assumption of constant error variance. We demonstrated analytically and with simulations that the proposed heteroscadastic-consistent variance estimators provide valid unconditional inference for ANCOVA, and the ANCOVA interaction model is more powerful than the ANCOVA main effect model when a design is unbalanced."
Dealing with Time in Health Economic Evaluation: Methodological Issues and Recommendations for Practice,PHARMACOECONOMICS,"Time is an important aspect of health economic evaluation, as the timing and duration of clinical events, healthcare interventions and their consequences all affect estimated costs and effects. These issues should be reflected in the design of health economic models. This article considers three important aspects of time in modelling: (1) which cohorts to simulate and how far into the future to extend the analysis; (2) the simulation of time, including the difference between discrete-time and continuous-time models, cycle lengths, and converting rates and probabilities; and (3) discounting future costs and effects to their present values. We provide a methodological overview of these issues and make recommendations to help inform both the conduct of cost-effectiveness analyses and the interpretation of their results. For choosing which cohorts to simulate and how many, we suggest analysts carefully assess potential reasons for variation in cost effectiveness between cohorts and the feasibility of subgroup-specific recommendations. For the simulation of time, we recommend using short cycles or continuous-time models to avoid biases and the need for half-cycle corrections, and provide advice on the correct conversion of transition probabilities in state transition models. Finally, for discounting, analysts should not only follow current guidance and report how discounting was conducted, especially in the case of differential discounting, but also seek to develop an understanding of its rationale. Our overall recommendations are that analysts explicitly state and justify their modelling choices regarding time and consider how alternative choices may impact on results."
Improving hospital falls screening and mitigation using a health professional education framework,NURSE EDUCATION TODAY,"Objective: Although health professional education has the potential to mitigate hospital falls risk, the best methods to develop, deliver and evaluate health professional education remain unclear. This study applied evidence-based approaches to education design to improve falls risk mitigation. Design: Mixed methods using questionnaires to evaluate health professionals knowledge of evidence-based falls risk assessment and mitigation, followed by semi-structured interviews with individual health professionals. Setting: Five large Australian hospitals. Participants: For each hospital, 10 clinical leaders from nursing and allied health professions were invited to participate in falls workshops. Methods: 46 participants received a three-hour education program on the latest evidence in hospital falls risk assessment and how to implement evidence-based falls screening and management. This was based on the 4P education model (Presage, Planning, Process and Product). They were taught practical skills to enable them to educate other health professionals. Results: The education workshop significantly changed participants' views about best practice guidelines for falls screening and prevention. Participants felt more confident in assessing falls risk and judging and implementing the best mitigation strategies. They were prepared and motivated to educate others about falls prevention and satisfied with the skills gained. Conclusions: A high-quality education program grounded in a rigorous quality framework improved health professionals knowledge regarding evidence-based falls prevention. Use of evidence-based rationales for behaviour change promotes effective learning."
Urology residents experience comparable workload profiles when performing live porcine nephrectomies and robotic surgery virtual reality training modules,JOURNAL OF ROBOTIC SURGERY,"In pursuit of improving the quality of residents' education, the Southeastern Section of the American Urological Association (SES AUA) hosts an annual robotic training course for its residents. The workshop involves performing a robotic live porcine nephrectomy as well as virtual reality robotic training modules. The aim of this study was to evaluate workload levels of urology residents when performing a live porcine nephrectomy and the virtual reality robotic surgery training modules employed during this workshop. Twenty-one residents from 14 SES AUA programs participated in 2015. On the first-day residents were taught with didactic lectures by faculty. On the second day, trainees were divided into two groups. Half were asked to perform training modules of the Mimic da Vinci-Trainer (MdVT, Mimic Technologies, Inc., Seattle, WA, USA) for 4 h, while the other half performed nephrectomy procedures on a live porcine model using the da Vinci Si robot (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). After the first 4 h the groups changed places for another 4-h session. All trainees were asked to complete the NASA-TLX 1-page questionnaire following both the MdVT simulation and live animal model sessions. A significant interface and TLX interaction was observed. The interface by TLX interaction was further analyzed to determine whether the scores of each of the six TLX scales varied across the two interfaces. The means of the TLX scores observed at the two interfaces were similar. The only significant difference was observed for frustration, which was significantly higher at the simulation than the animal model, t (20) = 4.12, p = 0.001. This could be due to trainees' familiarity with live anatomical structures over skill set simulations which remain a real challenge to novice surgeons. Another reason might be that the simulator provides performance metrics for specific performance traits as well as composite scores for entire exercises. Novice trainees experienced substantial mental workload while performing tasks on both the simulator and the live animal model during the robotics course. The NASA-TLX profiles demonstrated that the live animal model and the MdVT were similar in difficulty, as indicated by their comparable workload profiles."
Diagnosing Technical Competence in Six Bedside Procedures: Comparing Checklists and a Global Rating Scale in the Assessment of Resident Performance,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,"Purpose To compare procedure-specific checklists and a global rating scale in assessing technical competence. Method Two trained raters used procedure-specific checklists and a global rating scale to independently evaluate 218 video-recorded performances of six bedside procedures of varying complexity for technical competence. The procedures were completed by 47 residents participating in a formative simulation-based objective structured clinical examination at the University of Calgary in 2011. Pass/fail (competent/not competent) decisions were based on an overall global assessment item on the global rating scale. Raters provided written comments on performances they deemed not competent. Checklist minimum passing levels were set using traditional standard-setting methods. Results For each procedure, the global rating scale demonstrated higher internal reliability and lower interrater reliability than the checklist. However, interrater reliability was almost perfect for decisions on competence using the overall global assessment (Kappa range: 0.84-1.00). Clinically significant procedural errors were most often cited as reasons for ratings of not competent. Using checklist scores to diagnose competence demonstrated acceptable discrimination: The area under the curve ranged from 0.84 (95% CI 0.72-0.97) to 0.93 (95% CI 0.82-1.00). Checklist minimum passing levels demonstrated high sensitivity but low specificity for diagnosing competence. Conclusions Assessment using a global rating scale may be superior to assessment using a checklist for evaluation of technical competence. Traditional standard-setting methods may establish checklist cut scores with too-low specificity: High checklist scores did not rule out incompetence. The role of clinically significant errors in determining procedural competence should be further evaluated."
ESTIMATION OF THE HEPATIC EXTRACTION RATIO OF INDOCYANINE GREEN IN SWINE,CLINICAL SCIENCE,"1. The hepatic extraction ratio of Indocyanine Green was measured directly by trans-hepatic catheterization in 14 outbred swine (eight well-fed, six malnourished). A specific two-compartment pharmacokinetic model was fitted to the arterial Indocyanine Green concentration-time data and used to estimate the hepatic extraction ratio of Indocyanine Green. 2. The specific two-compartment pharmacokinetic model was modified to represent more accurately the physiological process of Indocyanine Green removal. Simulations were performed using this new model to estimate the hepatic extraction ratio of Indocyanine Green in the swine. 3. Similarly to previous findings, our data showed that the original model consistently overestimated the hepatic extraction ratio of Indocyanine Green (i.e. the model estimate was compared with the true, directly measured value). 4. The comparison of the modified model and the original model clearly indicates the reason for the overprediction of the hepatic extraction ratio of Indocyanine Green by the latter. The simulations using the new model indicate that the percentage of binding of Indocyanine Green to its transport protein (glutathione S-transferase) for removal in the bile will affect the estimation of the hepatic extraction ratio of Indocyanine Green. Thus, the amount of Indocyanine Green available for removal is less than that assumed by the original model."
"Web-Based Health Information Following the Renewal of the Cervical Screening Program in Australia: Evaluation of Readability, Understandability, and Credibility",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,"Background: Three main changes were implemented in the Australian National Cervical Screening Program (NCSP) in December 2017: an increase in the recommended age to start screening, extended screening intervals, and change from the Papanicolaou (Pap) test to primary human papillomavirus screening (cervical screening test). The internet is a readily accessible source of information to explain the reasons for these changes to the public. It is important that web based health information about changes to national screening programs is accessible and understandable for the general population. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate Australian web-based resources that provide information about the changes to the cervical screening program. Methods: The term cervical screening was searched in 3 search engines. The first 10 relevant results across the first 3 pages of each search engine were selected. Overall, 2 authors independently evaluated each website for readability (Flesch Reading Ease [FRE], Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook [SMOG] index), quality of information (Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool [PEMAT] for printable materials), credibility (Journal of the American Medical Association [JAMA] benchmark criteria and presence of Health on the Net Foundation code of conduct [HONcode] certification), website design, and usability with 5 simulation questions to assess the relevance of information. A descriptive analysis was conducted for the readability measures, PEMAT, and the JAMA benchmark criteria. Results: Of the 49 websites identified in the search, 15 were eligible for inclusion. The consumer-focused websites were classed as fairly difficult to read (mean FRE score 51.8, SD 13.3). The highest FRE score (easiest to read) was 70.4 (Cancer Council Australia Cervical Screening Consumer Site), and the lowest FRE score (most difficult to read) was 33.0 (NCSP Clinical Guidelines). A total of 9 consumer-focused websites and 4 health care provider-focused websites met the recommended threshold (sixth to eighth grade; SMOG index) for readability. The mean PEMAT understandability scores were 87.7% (SD 6.0%) for consumer-focused websites and 64.9% (SD 13.8%) for health care provider-focused websites. The mean actionability scores were 58.1% (SD 19.1%) for consumer-focused websites and 36.7% (SD 11.0%) for health care provider-focused websites. Moreover, 9 consumer-focused and 3 health care provider-focused websites scored above 70% for understandability, and 2 consumer-focused websites had an actionability score above 70%. A total of 3 websites met all 4 of the JAMA benchmark criteria, and 2 websites displayed the HONcode. Conclusions: It is important for women to have access to information that is at an appropriate reading level to better understand the implications of the changes to the cervical screening program. These findings can help health care providers direct their patients toward websites that provide information on cervical screening that is written at accessible reading levels and has high understandability."
Hypothesis generation using network structures on community health center cancer-screening performance,JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS,"Research objectives: Nationally sponsored cancer-care quality-improvement efforts have been deployed in community health centers to increase breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer-screening rates among vulnerable populations. Despite several immediate and short-term gains, screening rates remain below national benchmark objectives. Overall improvement has been both difficult to sustain over time in some organizational settings and/or challenging to diffuse to other settings as repeatable best practices. Reasons for this include facility-level changes, which typically occur in dynamic organizational environments that are complex, adaptive, and unpredictable. This study seeks to understand the factors that shape community health center facility-level cancer-screening performance overtime. This study applies a computational-modeling approach, combining principles of health-services research, health informatics, network theory, and systems science. Methods: To investigate the roles of knowledge acquisition, retention, and sharing within the setting of the community health center and to examine their effects on the relationship between clinical decision support capabilities and improvement in cancer-screening rate improvement, we employed Construct-TM to create simulated community health centers using previously collected point-in-time survey data. Construct-TM is a multi-agent model of network evolution. Because social, knowledge, and belief networks co-evolve, groups and organizations are treated as complex systems to capture the variability of human and organizational factors. In Construct-TM, individuals and groups interact by communicating, learning, and making decisions in a continuous cycle. Data from the survey was used to differentiate high-performing simulated community health centers from low-performing ones based on computer-based decision support usage and self-reported cancer-screening improvement. Results: This virtual experiment revealed that patterns of overall network symmetry, agent cohesion, and connectedness varied by community health center performance level. Visual assessment of both the agent-to-agent knowledge sharing network and agent-to-resource knowledge use network diagrams demonstrated that community health centers labeled as high performers typically showed higher levels of collaboration and cohesiveness among agent classes, faster knowledge-absorption rates, and fewer agents that were unconnected to key knowledge resources. Conclusions and research implications: Using the point-in-time survey data outlining community health center cancer-screening practices, our computational model successfully distinguished between high and low performers. Results indicated that high-performance environments displayed distinctive network characteristics in patterns of interaction among agents, as well as in the access and utilization of key knowledge resources. Our study demonstrated how non-network-specific data obtained from a point-in-time survey can be employed to forecast community health center performance over time, thereby enhancing the sustainability of long-term strategic-improvement efforts. Our results revealed a strategic profile for community health center cancer-screening improvement via simulation over a projected 10-year period. The use of computational modeling allows additional inferential knowledge to be drawn from existing data when examining organizational performance in increasingly complex environments.

Analysis of orotracheal intubation techniques in the intensive care unit,CRITICAL CARE AND RESUSCITATION,"Background: The development of specialised airway tools help laryngoscopists secure the airway in intensive care units. The use of videolaryngoscopy has been suggested in simulation studies, and human studies suggest that this advanced airway tool may have an advantage for difficult airways; however, less is known about its use in the ICU. Objective: To compare orotracheal intubation before and after acquisition of an ICU-dedicated Glide Scope (GS), and to determine the incidence of complications with orotracheal intubation in an ICU. Methods: An observational study was conducted from October 2008 to April 2009 to record the use of advanced airway tools including videolaryngoscopy before (pre-GS) and immediately after (post-GS) the purchase of an ICU-dedicated videolaryngoscope. Reasons for intubation, response time, type of intubation, number of attempts at intubation, reasons for delays in intubation, risk factors for difficult intubation and complications were compared between these groups. Results: 56 patients were intubated pre-GS and 47 post-GS. Although a significant increase in videolaryngoscopy was observed in the ICU (P=0.001), no significant reduction in total attempts at orotracheal intubation were observed (P=0.66), and that the incidence of overall complications were not reduced (P=0.21). Conclusions: The use of a new airway tool may not necessarily lead to immediate reduction in attempts at orotracheal intubation or in overall complication rates."
Detection of significant antiviral drug effects on COVID-19 with reasonable sample sizes in randomized controlled trials: A modeling study,PLOS MEDICINE,"Background Development of an effective antiviral drug for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health priority. Although several candidate drugs have been identified through in vitro and in vivo models, consistent and compelling evidence from clinical studies is limited. The lack of evidence from clinical trials may stem in part from the imperfect design of the trials. We investigated how clinical trials for antivirals need to be designed, especially focusing on the sample size in randomized controlled trials. Methods and findings A modeling study was conducted to help understand the reasons behind inconsistent clinical trial findings and to design better clinical trials. We first analyzed longitudinal viral load data for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) without antiviral treatment by use of a within-host virus dynamics model. The fitted viral load was categorized into 3 different groups by a clustering approach. Comparison of the estimated parameters showed that the 3 distinct groups were characterized by different virus decay rates (p-value < 0.001). The mean decay rates were 1.17 d(-1) (95% CI: 1.06 to 1.27 d(-1)), 0.777 d(-1) (0.716 to 0.838 d(-1)), and 0.450 d(-1) (0.378 to 0.522 d(-1)) for the 3 groups, respectively. Such heterogeneity in virus dynamics could be a confounding variable if it is associated with treatment allocation in compassionate use programs (i.e., observational studies). Subsequently, we mimicked randomized controlled trials of antivirals by simulation. An antiviral effect causing a 95% to 99% reduction in viral replication was added to the model. To be realistic, we assumed that randomization and treatment are initiated with some time lag after symptom onset. Using the duration of virus shedding as an outcome, the sample size to detect a statistically significant mean difference between the treatment and placebo groups (1:1 allocation) was 13,603 and 11,670 (when the antiviral effect was 95% and 99%, respectively) per group if all patients are enrolled regardless of timing of randomization. The sample size was reduced to 584 and 458 (when the antiviral effect was 95% and 99%, respectively) if only patients who are treated within 1 day of symptom onset are enrolled. We confirmed the sample size was similarly reduced when using cumulative viral load in log scale as an outcome. We used a conventional virus dynamics model, which may not fully reflect the detailed mechanisms of viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. The model needs to be calibrated in terms of both parameter settings and model structure, which would yield more reliable sample size calculation. Conclusions In this study, we found that estimated association in observational studies can be biased due to large heterogeneity in viral dynamics among infected individuals, and statistically significant effect in randomized controlled trials may be difficult to be detected due to small sample size. The sample size can be dramatically reduced by recruiting patients immediately after developing symptoms. We believe this is the first study investigated the study design of clinical trials for antiviral treatment using the viral dynamics model. Author summary Why was this study done? Most clinical studies of antiviral drugs for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have failed to observe a statistically significant effect, which may be due to poor designs of clinical trials. It is not well studied how clinical trials for antiviral drugs should be designed. Especially, sample size calculation methodology needs to be established. What did the researchers do and find? SARS-CoV-2 virus dynamics was quantified by fitting a virus dynamic model to longitudinal viral load data. Cluster analysis of the fitted viral loads revealed 3 distinct groups characterized by different virus decay rates, which could be a confounding factor in observational studies. Simulation mimicking randomized controlled trials demonstrated that sample size would be unreasonably large (>11,000 per group) if the timing of treatment initiation is not considered. The sample size is significantly reduced by including only patients enrolled early after symptom onset. What do these findings mean? Randomized controlled trials for antiviral drugs should recruit patients as early as possible after symptom onset or set inclusion criteria based on the time since symptom onset to observe statistically significant results. More precise models reflecting the features of SARS-CoV-2 infection may provide more reliable sample size estimates."
DEVELOPMENT OF A NON-INVASIVE DEVICE FOR ELECTRO-STIMULATION OF THE POSTERIOR TIBIAL NERVE IN PATIENTS WITH URINARY INCONTINENCE AT THE CENTRAL MILITARY HOSPITAL - BOGOTA 2020.,2020 IEEE GLOBAL HUMANITARIAN TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE (GHTC),"Overactive bladder (OB) is a condition that affects about 30 percent of men and 40 percent of women in the United States. It is characterized by an increased need for urgent urination, which often causes involuntary leakage of urine.On the other hand, there is evidence of a lack of adherence to conventional treatments for OB patients, most of which are invasive or medicated. For this reason, the goal is to develop a non-invasive, portable device that will stimulate the posterior tibial nerve for the management of urinary incontinence caused by OB. A five-stage methodology is proposed for the development of this project. The first stage is to identify the needs of the population with OB.The second stage is the simulation of the analogue prototype. The third stage is the design and construction of the analogical electro-stimulation prototype. In the fourth stage, the technical and electronic components for planning the digitization of the analog device are identified. Finally, in the fifth stage, a clinical trial is planned to test the device's efficacy and effectiveness in OB urinary incontinence by stimulating the posterior tibial nerve. The preliminary result is in phase three of the project in which the low-cost analogue and portable prototype was developed."
Three-dimensional Printing in Anatomy Education: Assessing Potential Ethical Dimensions,ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION,"New technological developments have frequently had major consequences for anatomy education, and have raised ethical queries for anatomy educators. The advent of three-dimensional (3D) printing of human material is showing considerable promise as an educational tool that fits alongside cadaveric dissection, plastination, computer simulation, and anatomical models and images. At first glance its ethical implications appear minimal, and yet the more extensive ethical implications around clinical bioprinting suggest that a cautious approach to 3D printing in the dissecting room is in order. Following an overview of early groundbreaking studies into 3D printing of prosections, organs, and archived fetal material, it has become clear that their origin, using donated bodies or 3D files available on the Internet, has ethical overtones. The dynamic presented by digital technology raises questions about the nature of the consent provided by the body donor, reasons for 3D printing, the extent to which it will be commercialized, and its comparative advantages over other available teaching resources. In exploring questions like these, the place of 3D printing within a hierarchical sequence of value is outlined. Discussion centers on the significance of local usage of prints, the challenges created by regarding 3D prints as disposable property, the importance of retaining the human side to anatomy, and the unacceptability of obtaining 3D-printed material from unclaimed bodies. It is concluded that the scientific tenor of 3D processes represents a move away from the human person, so that efforts are required to prevent them accentuating depersonalization and commodification."
A randomized controlled trial of the cost-utility of second-generation antipsychotics in people with psychosis and eligible for clozapine,VALUE IN HEALTH,"Objective: To assess whether clozapine is likely to be more cost-effective than other second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) in people with schizophrenia. Methods: An integrated clinical and economic multicenter, rater-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared clozapine to the class of other SGAs, using the perspectives of the National Health Service, social support services, and patients. The practice setting was secondary and primary care in the United Kingdom; patients were followed for I year. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), net benefit statistics, and cost acceptability curves were estimated. Results: The ICER for clozapine was 33,240 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) (range 23,000-70,000 pound for the sensitivity analyses). The proportion of simulations when clozapine was more cost-effective than other SGAs reached 50% if decision-makers are prepared to pay 30,000 pound to 35,000 pound per QALY. This is at the top of the range of acceptable willingness-to-pay values per QALY implied by decisions taken by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Conclusions: This study adds to a limited body of evidence comparing clozapine to other SGAs and is the first economic and clinical RCT to compare clozapine to the class of other SGAs using the lower cost of generic clozapine and a pragmatic trial design. Policy decisions by the NICE suggest that additional reasons would be needed to accept clozapine as effective and efficient if it had a high probability of having ICERs more than 35,000 pound per QALY. The results and limitations of the analysis suggest that there is still a need for, further economic evaluation of clozapine."
Testing small study effects in multivariate meta-analysis,BIOMETRICS,"Small study effects occur when smaller studies show different, often larger, treatment effects than large ones, which may threaten the validity of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The most well-known reasons for small study effects include publication bias, outcome reporting bias, and clinical heterogeneity. Methods to account for small study effects in univariate meta-analysis have been extensively studied. However, detecting small study effects in a multivariate meta-analysis setting remains an untouched research area. One of the complications is that different types of selection processes can be involved in the reporting of multivariate outcomes. For example, some studies may be completely unpublished while others may selectively report multiple outcomes. In this paper, we propose a score test as an overall test of small study effects in multivariate meta-analysis. Two detailed case studies are given to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed test over various naive applications of univariate tests in practice. Through simulation studies, the proposed test is found to retain nominal Type I error rates with considerable power in moderate sample size settings. Finally, we also evaluate the concordance between the proposed tests with the naive application of univariate tests by evaluating 44 systematic reviews with multiple outcomes from the Cochrane Database."
How to deal with missing longitudinal data in cost of illness analysis in Alzheimer's disease-suggestions from the GERAS observational study,BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY,"Background: Missing data are a common problem in prospective studies with a long follow-up, and the volume, pattern and reasons for missing data may be relevant when estimating the cost of illness. We aimed to evaluate the effects of different methods for dealing with missing longitudinal cost data and for costing caregiver time on total societal costs in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: GERAS is an 18-month observational study of costs associated with AD. Total societal costs included patient health and social care costs, and caregiver health and informal care costs. Missing data were classified as missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR) or missing not at random (MNAR). Simulation datasets were generated from baseline data with 10-40 % missing total cost data for each missing data mechanism. Datasets were also simulated to reflect the missing cost data pattern at 18 months using MAR and MNAR assumptions. Naive and multiple imputation (MI) methods were applied to each dataset and results compared with complete GERAS 18-month cost data. Opportunity and replacement cost approaches were used for caregiver time, which was costed with and without supervision included and with time for working caregivers only being costed. Results: Total costs were available for 99.4 % of 1497 patients at baseline. For MCAR datasets, naive methods performed as well as MI methods. For MAR, MI methods performed better than naive methods. All imputation approaches were poor for MNAR data. For all approaches, percentage bias increased with missing data volume. For datasets reflecting 18-month patterns, a combination of imputation methods provided more accurate cost estimates (e.g. bias: -1 % vs -6 % for single MI method), although different approaches to costing caregiver time had a greater impact on estimated costs (29-43 % increase over base case estimate). Conclusions: Methods used to impute missing cost data in AD will impact on accuracy of cost estimates although varying approaches to costing informal caregiver time has the greatest impact on total costs. Tailoring imputation methods to the reason for missing data will further our understanding of the best analytical approach for studies involving cost outcomes."
Misclassification in defining and diagnosing microcephaly,PAEDIATRIC AND PERINATAL EPIDEMIOLOGY,"Background Several health agencies define microcephaly for surveillance purposes using a single criterion, a percentile or Z-score cut-off for newborn head circumference. This definition, however, conflicts with the reported prevalence of microcephaly even in populations with endemic Zika virus. Objective We explored possible reasons for this conflict, hypothesising that the definition of microcephaly used in some studies may be incompletely described, lacking the additional clinical criteria that clinicians use to make a formal diagnosis. We also explored the potential for misclassification that can result from differences in these definitions, especially when applying a percentile cut-off definition in the presence of the much lower observed prevalence estimates that we believe to be valid. Methods We conducted simulations under a theoretical bimodal distribution of head circumference. For different definitions of microcephaly, we calculated the sensitivity and specificity using varying cut-offs of head circumference. We then calculated and plotted the positive predictive value for each of these definitions by prevalence of microcephaly. Results Simple simulations suggest that if the true prevalence of microcephaly is approximately what is reported in peer-reviewed literature, then relying on cut-off-based definitions may lead to very poor positive predictive value under realistic conditions. Conclusions While a simple head circumference criterion may be used in practice as a screening or surveillance tool, the definition lacks clarification as to what constitutes true pathological microcephaly and may lead to confusion about the true prevalence of microcephaly in Zika-endemic areas, as well as bias in aetiologic studies."
Patient Information Items Needed to Guide the Allocation of Scarce Life-Sustaining Resources: A Delphi Study of Multidisciplinary Experts,DISASTER MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS,"Objective: Plans for allocation of scarce life-sustaining resources during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic often include triage teams, but operational details are lacking, including what patient information is needed to make triage decisions. Methods: A Delphi study among Washington state disaster preparedness experts was performed to develop a list of patient information items needed for triage team decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts proposed and rated their agreement with candidate information items during asynchronous Delphi rounds. Consensus was defined as >= 80% agreement. Qualitative analysis was used to describe considerations arising in this deliberation. A timed simulation was performed to evaluate feasibility of data collection from the electronic health record. Results: Over 3 asynchronous Delphi rounds, 50 experts reached consensus on 24 patient information items, including patients' age, severe or end-stage comorbidities, the reason for and timing of admission, measures of acute respiratory failure, and clinical trajectory. Experts weighed complex considerations around how information items could support effective prognostication, consistency, accuracy, minimizing bias, and operationalizability of the triage process. Data collection took a median of 227 seconds (interquartile range = 205, 298) per patient. Conclusions: Experts achieved consensus on patient information items that were necessary and appropriate for informing triage teams during the COVID-19 pandemic."
Mathematical modeling and analysis of combinational immune boost for tumor elimination,SYMPOSIUM ON BIOMATHEMATICS (SYMOMATH 2015),"The immune system has an ability to recognize tumor as non-self antigen, and initiates inflammatory response to eliminate tumor. A dendritic cell (DCs) population is one of immune cell subsets that specifically uptakes foreign antigen and then presents to T cells. Dendritic cell boost ex vivo is operated to enhance immune response against tumor that in general comes to fail due to several complex reasons. Although dendritic cell therapy has been operated in clinical trials by boosting tumor immune responses, less is known about dynamic behaviors generated by interactions among immune cell subsets and tumor cells. In this paper, we construct and analyze a mathematical model describing tumor killing by T cells activated by dendritic cells. A handling time representing a waiting time required for T cells to be activated during antigen presentation is incorporated in our model. Mathematical analyses imply that successful tumor elimination depends on the amount of T cells activated ex vivo when introduced. Moreover, numerical simulations imply that an immune escape basin in which tumor can escape from T cell responses increases when the handling time increases, indicating that efficient tumor elimination might result in immediate T cell inactivation due to rapid decline of antigenic stimulation."
"Estimating long-term effects of treatment from placebo-controlled trials with an extension period, using virtual twins",STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,"The best information about the benefits of long-term treatment is obtained from a long-term placebo-controlled trial. However, once efficacy has been demonstrated in relatively brief trials, it may not be possible to conduct long-term placebo-controlled trials, for ethical or practical reasons. This paper presents a method for estimating long-term effects of a treatment from a placebo-controlled trial in which some participants originally randomized to active-treatment volunteer to continue on treatment during an extension study, but follow-up of participants originally assigned to placebo ends with the trial, or they are crossed over to active treatment during the extension. We propose using data from the trial to project the outcomes for a 'virtual twin' for each active-treatment volunteer under the counterfactual placebo condition, and using bootstrap methods for inference. The proposed method is validated using simulation, and applied to data rom the Fracture Intervention Trial and its extension, FLEX. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
Assessment of continuous acoustic respiratory rate monitoring as an addition to a pulse oximetry-based patient surveillance system,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING,"Technology advances make it possible to consider continuous acoustic respiratory rate monitoring as an integral component of physiologic surveillance systems. This study explores technical and logistical aspects of augmenting pulse oximetry-based patient surveillance systems with continuous respiratory rate monitoring and offers some insight into the impact on patient deterioration detection that may result. Acoustic respiratory rate sensors were introduced to a general care pulse oximetry-based surveillance system with respiratory rate alarms deactivated. Simulation was used after 4324 patient days to determine appropriate alarm thresholds for respiratory rate, which were then activated. Data were collected for an additional 4382 patient days. Physiologic parameters, alarm data, sensor utilization and patient/staff feedback were collected throughout the study and analyzed. No notable technical or workflow issues were observed. Sensor utilization was 57 %, with patient refusal leading reasons for nonuse (22.7 %). With respiratory rate alarm thresholds set to 6 and 40 breaths/min., the majority of nurse pager clinical notifications were triggered by low oxygen saturation values (43 %), followed by low respiratory rate values (21 %) and low pulse rate values (13 %). Mean respiratory rate collected was 16.6 +/- 3.8 breaths/min. The vast majority (82 %) of low oxygen saturation states coincided with normal respiration rates of 12-20 breaths/min. Continuous respiratory rate monitoring can be successfully added to a pulse oximetry-based surveillance system without significant technical, logistical or workflow issues and is moderately well-tolerated by patients. Respiratory rate sensor alarms did not significantly impact overall system alarm burden. Respiratory rate and oxygen saturation distributions suggest adding continuous respiratory rate monitoring to a pulse oximetry-based surveillance system may not significantly improve patient deterioration detection."
Cost-Effectiveness of Insuring the Uninsured: The Case of Korean American Children,MEDICAL DECISION MAKING,"Background. More than one quarter of Korean American children are uninsured, and many are eligible for children's health insurance programs. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different school-based health insurance strategies to provide coverage to uninsured Korean American children. Method. The authors used a quasi-experimental nonequivalent control group design, conducted from July to December 2005 in Los Angeles, California. The subjects were Korean American children in 3 groups/schools (n=1181). Parents received a variation of outreach methods (i.e., information sheets, school site presentations, automated telephone messages, personal telephone calls) and application assistance (i.e., telephone helpline, on-site assistance). The authors used bivariate and multivariable analysis to assess effectiveness. Cost-effectiveness was performed using a 3-stage model and Monte Carlo simulation. Results. Of the uninsured in the intensive intervention group, 41% applied for insurance compared with 13% of the control group (P=0.002). This success was due to personal telephone calls. Of the uninsured in the intensive intervention group, 23% enrolled in insurance compared with 10% of the control group (P=0.048). The most common reason reported by parents for nonenrollment despite assistance was failure to mail in the application. Despite the small increase in insurance enrollment from the intensive intervention strategy compared with the control group, it is cost-effective. Conclusions. Personal telephone calls are effective in increasing outreach for children's health insurance application. However, more research is needed to investigate why parents fail to mail in the application. Ultimately, insuring more children will result in cost-effective improvements in quality-adjusted life years."
Features that contribute to the usefulness of low-fidelity models for surgical skills training,VETERINARY RECORD,"For practical, ethical and economic reasons, veterinary surgical education is becoming increasingly dependent on models for training. The limited availability and high cost of commercially produced surgical models has increased the need for useful, low-cost alternatives. For this reason, a number of models were developed to be used in a basic surgical skills course for veterinary students. The models were low fidelity, having limited resemblance to real animals. The aim of the present study was to describe the students' learning experience with the models and to report their perception of the usefulness of the models in applying the trained skills to live animal surgery. One hundred and forty-six veterinary fourth-year students evaluated the models on a four-point Likert scale. Of these, 26 additionally participated in individual semistructured interviews. The survey results showed that 75 per cent of the students rated the models 'useful'/'very useful'. Interviews revealed that tactile, dimensional, visual, situational and emotional features are important to students' perception of a successful translation of skills from models to live animal. In conclusion, low-fidelity models are useful educational tools in preparation for live animal surgery. However, there are specific features to take into account when developing models in order for students to perceive them as useful."
Online updating method with new variables for big data streams,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE,"For big data arriving in streams online updating is an important statistical method that breaks the storage barrier and the computational barrier under certain circumstances. In the regression context online updating algorithms assume that the set of predictor variables does not change, and consequently cannot incorporate new variables that may become available midway through the data stream. A naive approach would be to discard all previous information and start updating with new variables from scratch. We propose a method that utilizes the information from earlier data in the online updating algorithm with bias corrections to improve efficiency. The method is developed for linear models first, and then extended to estimating equations for generalized linear models. Closed-form expressions for the efficiency gain over the naive approach are derived in a particular linear model setting. We compare the performance of our proposed bias-correcting approach and the naive approach in simulation studies with data generated from a normal linear model and a logistic regression model. The method is applied to a study on airline delay, where reasons for delays were only available more recently, starting in 2003.

The value of provider-to-provider telehealth,TELEMEDICINE JOURNAL AND E-HEALTH,"Telehealth has great potential to improve access to care, but its adoption in routine healthcare has been slow. The lack of clarity about the value of telehealth implementations has been one reason cited for this slow adoption. The Center for Information Technology Leadership has examined the value of telehealth encounters in which there is a provider both with the patient and at a distance from the patient. We considered three models of telehealth: store-and-forward, real-time video, and hybrid systems. Evidence from the literature was extrapolated using a computer simulation, which found that the hybrid model was the most cost effective. The simulation predicted savings of $4.3 billion per year if hybrid telehealth systems were implemented in emergency rooms, prisons, nursing home facilities, and physician offices across the United States. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine which factors most influence costs and savings. Payers, providers, and policy-makers should work together to remove the barriers to the adoption of telehealth so that this cost savings can be realized in the U. S. healthcare system."
Assessment of optical CT as a future QA tool for synchrotron x-ray microbeam therapy,PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,"Synchrotron microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) is an advanced form of radiotherapy for which it is extremely difficult to provide adequate quality assurance. This may delay or limit its clinical uptake, particularly in the paediatric patient populations for whom it could be especially suitable. This study investigates the extent to which new developments in 3D dosimetry using optical computed tomography (CT) can visualise MRT dose distributions, and assesses what further developments are necessary before fully quantitative 3D measurements can be achieved. Two experiments are reported. In the first cylindrical samples of the radiochromic polymer PRESAGE (R) were irradiated with different complex MRT geometries including multiport treatments of collimated 'pencil' beams, interlaced microplanar arrays and a multiport treatment using an anthropomorphic head phantom. Samples were scanned using transmission optical CT. In the second experiment, optical CT measurements of the biologically important peak-to-valley dose ratio (PVDR) were compared with expected values from Monte Carlo simulations. The depth-of-field (DOF) of the optical CT system was characterised using a knife-edge method and the possibility of spatial resolution improvement through deconvolution of a measured point spread function (PSF) was investigated. 3D datasets from the first experiment revealed excellent visualisation of the 50 mu m beams and various discrepancies from the planned delivery dose were found. The optical CT PVDR measurements were found to be consistently 30% of the expected Monte Carlo values and deconvolution of the microbeam profiles was found to lead to increased noise. The reason for the underestimation of the PVDR by optical CT was attributed to lack of spatial resolution, supported by the results of the DOF characterisation. Solutions are suggested for the outstanding challenges and the data are shown already to be useful in identifying potential treatment anomalies."
Computer Modelling the Effects of Chloroquine on KCNJ2 D172N and E299V Mutations-linked Short QT Syndrome,2020 COMPUTING IN CARDIOLOGY,"Short QT syndrome (SQTS) is an inherited cardiac disease characterized by ventricular tachyarrhythmias leading to sudden cardiac death (SCD). SQT3 has been linked to the D172N or E299V gain-in-function mutation to Kir2.1, which preferentially increases outward current through channels responsible for inward rectifier K+ current (I-K1). Until now, the only effective therapy is implantation of a defibrillator whereas clinical drug therapy is little known about it. Previous studies reported that anti-malarial drug chloroquine was an effective inhibitor of the mutant Kir2.1 channels. The effectiveness of chloroquine has demonstrated in SQT3 associated with D172N mutation, there is a reason to believe that it may be useful in the other mutations in SQT3, such as E299V mutation. Therefore, we aim to predict and compare the potential effects of drug chloroquine on SQT3 D172N and E299V mutations. In this study, the ten Tusscher model of ventricular cell was coupled with the SQT3 mutant I-K1 patch clamp data. Our simulation data showed that chloroquine prolonged the ventricular cell action potential duration (APD) and QT interval under SQT3 condition, and demonstrated that chloroquine produced a therapeutic effect on different mutant SQT3. This study provides new evidence that chloroquine may be a potential generic drug for the treatment of SQTS."
Experimental assessment of the safety and potential efficacy of high irradiance photostimulation of brain tissues,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Optogenetics is widely used in fundamental neuroscience. Its potential clinical translation for brain neuromodulation requires a careful assessment of the safety and efficacy of repeated, sustained optical stimulation of large volumes of brain tissues. This study was performed in rats and not in non-human primates for ethical reasons. We studied the spatial distribution of light, potential damage, and nonphysiological effects in vivo, in anesthetized rat brains, on large brain volumes, following repeated high irradiance photo- stimulation. We generated 2D irradiance and temperature increase surface maps based on recordings taken during optical stimulation using irradiance and temporal parameters representative of common optogenetics experiments. Irradiances of 100 to 600 mW/mm(2) with 5 ms pulses at 20, 40, and 60 Hz were applied during 90 s. In vivo electrophysiological recordings and postmortem histological analyses showed that high power light stimulation had no obvious phototoxic effects and did not trigger non-physiological functional activation. This study demonstrates the ability to illuminate cortical layers to a depth of several millimeters using pulsed red light without detrimental thermal damages."
Proof-of-concept demonstration of edge-illumination x-ray phase contrast imaging combined with tomosynthesis,PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,"In this note we present the first proof-of-concept results on the potential effectiveness of the edge-illumination x-ray phase contrast method (in its 'coded-aperture' based lab implementation) combined with tomosynthesis. We believe that, albeit admittedly preliminary (e. g. we only present phantom work), these results deserve early publication in a note primarily for four reasons. First, we fully modelled the imaging acquisition method, and validated the simulation directly with experimental results. This shows that the implementation of the method in the new geometry is understood, and thus that it will be possible to use the model to simulate more complex scenarios in the future. Secondly, we show that a strong phase contrast signal is preserved in the reconstructed tomosynthesis slices: this was a concern, as the high spatial frequency nature of the signal makes it sensitive to any filtration-related procedure. Third, we show that, despite the non-optimized nature of the imaging prototype used, we can perform a full angular scan at acceptable dose levels and with exposure times not excessively distant from what is required by clinical practice. Finally, we discuss how the proposed phase contrast method, unlike other approaches apart from free-space propagation (which however requires a smaller focal spot, thus reducing the flux and increasing exposure times), can be easily implemented in a tomosynthesis geometry suitable for clinical use. In summary, we find that these technical results indicate a high potential for the combination of the two methods. Combining slice separation with detail enhancement provided by phase effects would substantially increase the detectability of small lesions"
Counterfactual Thinking in Tourette's Syndrome: A Study Using Three Measures,BEHAVIOURAL NEUROLOGY,"Pathophysiological evidence suggests an involvement of frontostriatal circuits in Tourette syndrome (TS) and cognitive abnormalities have been detected in tasks sensitive to cognitive deficits associated with prefrontal damage (verbal fluency, planning, attention shifting, working memory, cognitive flexibility, and social reasoning). A disorder in counterfactual thinking (CFT), a behavioural executive process linked to the prefrontal cortex functioning, has not been investigated in TS. CFT refers to the generation of a mental simulation of alternatives to past factual events, actions, and outcomes. It is a pervasive cognitive feature in everyday life and it is closely related to decision-making, planning, problem-solving, and experience-driven learning-cognitive processes that involve wide neuronal networks in which prefrontal lobes play a fundamental role. Clinical observations in patients with focal prefrontal lobe damage or with neurological and psychiatric diseases related to frontal lobe dysfunction (e. g., Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and schizophrenia) show counterfactual thinking impairments. In this work, we evaluate the performance of CFT in a group of patients with Tourette's syndrome compared with a group of healthy participants. Overall results showed no statistical differences in counterfactual thinking between TS patients and controls in the three counterfactual measures proposed. The possible explanations of this unexpected result are discussed below."
Numerical models for assessing the risk of leaflet thrombosis post-transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve implantation,ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE,"Leaflet thrombosis has been suggested as the reason for the reduced leaflet motion in cases of hypoattenuated leaflet thickening of bioprosthetic aortic valves. This work aimed to estimate the risk of leaflet thrombosis in two post-valve-in-valve (ViV) configurations, using five different numerical approaches. Realistic ViV configurations were calculated by modelling the deployments of the latest version of transcatheter aortic valve devices (Medtronic Evolut PRO, Edwards SAPIEN 3) in the surgical Sorin Mitroflow. Computational fluid dynamics simulations of blood flow followed the dry models. Lagrangian and Eulerian measures of near-wall stagnation were implemented by particle and concentration tracking, respectively, to estimate the thrombogenicity and to predict the risk locations. Most of the numerical approaches indicate a higher leaflet thrombosis risk in the Edwards SAPIEN 3 device because of its intra-annular implantation. The Eulerian approaches estimated high-risk locations in agreement with the wall sheer stress (WSS) separation points. On the other hand, the Lagrangian approaches predicted high-risk locations at the proximal regions of the leaflets matching the low WSS magnitude regions of both transcatheter aortic valve implantation models and reported clinical and experimental data. The proposed methods can help optimizing future designs of transcatheter aortic valves with minimal thrombotic risks."
Common Methods for Handling Missing Data in Marginal Structural Models: What Works and Why,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY,"Marginal structural models (MSMs) are commonly used to estimate causal intervention effects in longitudinal nonrandomized studies. A common challenge when using MSMs to analyze observational studies is incomplete confounder data, where a poorly informed analysis method will lead to biased estimates of intervention effects. Despite a number of approaches described in the literature for handling missing data in MSMs, there is little guidance on what works in practice and why. We reviewed existing missing-data methods for MSMs and discussed the plausibility of their underlying assumptions. We also performed realistic simulations to quantify the bias of 5 methods used in practice: complete-case analysis, last observation carried forward, the missingness pattern approach, multiple imputation, and inverse-probability-of-missingness weighting. We considered 3 mechanisms for nonmonotone missing data encountered in research based on electronic health record data. Further illustration of the strengths and limitations of these analysis methods is provided through an application using a cohort of persons with sleep apnea: the research database of the French Observatoire Sommeil de la Federation de Pneumologie. We recommend careful consideration of 1) the reasons for missingness, 2) whether missingness modifies the existing relationships among observed data, and 3) the scientific context and data source, to inform the choice of the appropriate method(s) for handling partially observed confounders in MSMs."
The Manton-Woodbury model for longitudinal data with dropouts,STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,"Often in longitudinal studies one is not able to obtain a complete set of measurements of the variable recorded over time for each person in the study. This could be caused by some of the persons dying (or leaving the study for some other reasons) while the study is going on. If there is any concern that such missing data (which have been termed dropouts) and the variables measured over time affect each other, a model for the joint distribution is needed. For a review of several such models see Hogan and Laird (in this volume). A model of the same kind was proposed by Woodbury and Manton and developed further later on, In this model it is possible to describe the evolution of the distribution of the variable measured over time when exposed to mortality selection. In contrast to other models, this allows for an explicit description of the interaction between the variable measured over time and the time to dropout, We describe the model and propose some generalizations. The theory is illustrated by some Monte Carlo simulations."
An autoregressive linear mixed effects model for the analysis of longitudinal data which include dropouts and show profiles approaching asymptotes,STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,"We are interested in longitudinal data of a continuous response that show profiles with an initial sharp change and approaching asymptotes for each patient, and many patients drop out with a reason related to the response. In this paper, we focus on a model that assumes a dropout process is missing at random (MAR). In this dropout process, we can obtain consistent maximum likelihood estimators as long as both the mean and covariance structures are correctly specified. However, parsimonious covariance structures for the profiles approaching asymptotes are unclear. An autoregressive linear mixed effects model can express the profile with random individual asymptotes. We show that this model provides a new parsimonious covariance structure. The covariance structure at steady state is Compound symmetry and the other elements of the covariance depend on the measurement points. In simulation studies, the estimate of the asymptote is unbiased in MAR dropouts, but biased in non-ignorable dropouts. We also applied this model to actual schizophrenia trial data.

Spatiotemporal analysis for indocyanine green-aided imaging of rheumatoid arthritis in hand joints,JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common chronic inflammatory joint disease, with a prevalence of 0.5 to 1% in the general population. Imaging can possibly aid in early diagnosis, crucial to effective personalized therapeutic strategies and treatment follow-up. The intravenous administration of indocyanine green (ICG) has been considered for identifying synovial hyperperfusion as an RA physiological biomarker. However, while the distribution of ICG in the human hand is a time-dependent process, the particular biodistribution dynamic patterns established following intravenous administration have not yet been studied. For this reason, the dynamic relationships of ICG distribution in the human hand in RA patients using a method based on principal component analysis are analyzed. In vivo analyses were corroborated by simulations of clinical scenarios using a finite element method. Observations of spatiotemporal characteristics are contrasted to fluorescence intensity images and magnetic resonance images of the hand joints, employed as the anatomical and diagnostic reference. Processing results for 450 joints from 5 healthy volunteers and 10 patients show that image features obtained from the spatiotemporal analysis offer good congruence with synovitis and reveal better detection performance compared to observations of raw fluorescence intensity images.

"Exaggeration of PFS by blinded, independent, central review (BICR)",ANNALS OF ONCOLOGY,"Background: Recent published studies have shown meaningful discrepancies between local investigator and blinded, independent, central review (BICR) assessed median progression-free survival (PFS). When the local review but not BICR shows progression, generally, no further assessments are carried out and patients are censored in the BICR analysis, leading to violation of the statistical assumptions of independence between censoring and outcome used in survival analysis methods. Methods: We carried out a simulation study to assess methodological reasons behind these discrepancies and corroborated our findings in a case study of three BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer trials. We briefly outline possible methodological solutions that may lead to improved estimation of the BICR medians. Results: The Kaplan-Meier (KM) curve for the BICR PFS can often be exaggerated. The degree of bias is largest when there is reasonably strong correlation between BICR and local PFS, especially when PFS is long compared with assessment frequency. This can result in an exaggeration of the medians and their difference; however, the hazard ratio (HR) is much less susceptible to bias. Our simulation shows that when the true BICR median PFS was 19 months, and patients assessed every 12 weeks, the estimated KM curves were materially biased whenever the correlation between BICR and local PFS was 0.4 or greater. This was corroborated by case studies where, in the active arm, the BICR median PFS was between 6 and 11 months greater than the local median PFS. Further research is required to find improved methods for estimating BICR survival curves. Conclusions: In general, when there is a difference between local and BICR medians, the true BICR KM curve is likely to be exaggerated and its true median will probably lie somewhere between the observed local and BICR medians. Presentation of data should always include both BICR and local results whenever a BICR is carried out."
Fast analytical methods for finding significant labeled graph motifs,DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY,"Network motif discovery is the problem of finding subgraphs of a network that occur more frequently than expected, according to some reasonable null hypothesis. Such subgraphs may indicate small scale interaction features in genomic interaction networks or intriguing relationships involving actors or a relationship among airlines. When nodes are labeled, they can carry information such as the genomic entity under study or the dominant genre of an actor. For that reason, labeled subgraphs convey information beyond structure and could therefore enjoy more applications. To identify statistically significant motifs in a given network, we propose an analytical method (i.e. simulation-free) that extends the works of Picard et al. (J Comput Biol 15(1):1-20, 2008) and Schbath et al. (J Bioinform Syst Biol 2009(1):616234, 2009) to label-dependent scale-free graph models. We provide an analytical expression of the mean and variance of the count under the Expected Degree Distribution random graph model. Our model deals with both induced and non-induced motifs. We have tested our methodology on a wide set of graphs ranging from protein-protein interaction networks to movie networks. The analytical model is a fast (usually faster by orders of magnitude) alternative to simulation. This advantage increases as graphs grow in size."
"Prospective contouring rounds: A novel, high-impact tool for optimizing quality assurance",PRACTICAL RADIATION ONCOLOGY,"Purpose: This study was designed to present the results of a novel prospective contouring rounds (CR), in which peer review occurs once the contours and written directive are completed but before initiation of treatment planning. Methods and materials: Beginning in 2012, all patients undergoing conventionally fractionated radiation therapy at a high-volume academic center were reviewed in a newly initiated daily, prospective, multidisciplinary CR. Cases were scheduled for presentation 2 days after simulation with the expectation that contours would be complete. The clinical suitability of the clinical plan, prescription, contours, and written directive were evaluated and recorded in a prospective database. Treatment planning did not commence until CR approval. Patient information and the prospective database from the first 6 months since program inception, which represented 581 consecutive treatment plans, were pooled and analyzed retrospectively to determine the impact of the prospective peer review at this stage of care delivery. Results: Sixty-four percent of cases were completed on time without correction. The remaining 36% of cases required modification before treatment planning was initiated. Incomplete contours, target-volume modifications, and alterations to the written directive were the most common corrections or reasons for delay. Decreasing rates of incomplete contours, contour modifications, and miscellaneous delays were seen over time as the program became established. The percentage of cases that had no delays or modifications increased continuously as the program matured in the first 6 months, from 59% to 70%. Conclusions: Prospective CR is a meaningful and impactful tool in the quality assurance process. More than one-third of cases required contour, directive, or scheduling modification. The establishment of CR improved quality of care, with the percentage of timely, errorless cases increasing steadily over time. The impact of clinical peer review may be optimized by implementation at this early stage of delivery of care rather than at the time of traditional chart rounds.

Wavelet Subspace Analysis of Intraoperative Thermal Imaging for Motion Filtering,"IMAGE ANALYSIS AND RECOGNITION, ICIAR 2014, PT II","Intraoperative thermography allows fast capturing of small temperature variations during neurosurgical operations. External influences induce periodic vibrational motion to the whole camera system superimposing signals of high-frequent neuronal activity, heart rate activity and injected perfusion tracers by motion artifacts. In this work, we propose a robust method to eliminate the effects induced by the vibrational motion allowing further inference of clinical information. For this purpose, an efficient wavelet shrinkage scheme is developed based on subspace analysis in 1D wavelet domain to recognize and remove motion related patterns. The approach does not require any specific motion modeling or image warping, making it fast and preventing image deformations. Promising results of a simulation study and by intraoperative measurements make this method a reliable and efficient method improving subsequent perfusion and neuronal activity analysis."
A portable real-time ultrasonic bone densitometer,ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,"The objectives of this study were to develop a novel ultrasound device to estimate bone mineral density (BMD) at the calcaneus. The device is entirely self-contained, portable (:<= 1kg) and handheld and permits real-time evaluation of the BMD by computing a parameter known as net time delay (NTD). The NTD is defined as the difference between the transit time through the heel of an ultrasound signal and the transit time through a hypothetical object of equal thickness (to the heel) but containing soft tissue only. This parameter is sensitive primarily to the total amount (i.e., the average total thickness) of bone contained in the propagation path, and thus is equivalent to the bone mineral content estimated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanners, and to the (areal) BMD when normalized by transducer area. Computer simulations of ultrasound propagation were used to study the relationship between NTD and BMD. The simulations used micro-computed tomography (mu-CT) images of a set of 10 calcaneal bone cores, which were further processed by morphologic image processing to obtain a set of 30 '' samples '' with BMDs ranging from 0.25 to 1.83 g/cm(2). The NTD and BMD were found to be very highly correlated (r = 0.99), demonstrating the high sensitivity of NTD to bone mass. A clinical institutional review board-approved study measured 85 adult women at the heel. BMD was measured at the same time using DXA. A linear regression using NTD produced a linear correlation coefficient of 0.86, which represents a significant improvement over present ultrasound bone densitometers, but not nearly as good as the simulation results. Reasons for this have been identified (viz,, errors in distance measurement and lack of coincidence between the DXA and ultrasound regions of interest), and a new device and experimental protocol to deal with these sources of error has been developed and is currently under clinical trials. It is expected that this should improve the correlation between NTD and BMD even further (>= 0.9), effectively making the former parameter a proxy for the latter. In conclusion, although X-ray methods are effective in bone mass assessment, osteoporosis remains one of the largest undiagnosed and under-diagnosed diseases in the world today. The research described here, in conjunction with the fact that the devices are designed to be manufactured at very low cost (similar to$400 USD), should enable the significant expansion of diagnosis and monitoring of osteoporosis.

Myocardial-vessel interaction: role of LV pressure and myocardial contractility,MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING,"Coronary heart disease is one of the most important health problems in Western society. The principal mechanism in this problem is the failure of sufficient blood supply to reach the heart muscle for cardiac metabolic needs and hence failure of the heart as a pump. Despite the magnitude of this health problem, the system of blood supply to the heart (the coronary circulation) remains poorly understood. The reason for this is that clinical work has largely focused on the diseased vessels (e.g., atherosclerosis) rather than on the dynamics of the coronary blood flow system as a whole. The latter requires a bioengineering understanding of both the highly complex system and associated mechanical determinants. Despite progress in this area, many issues remain unresolved. Advancements in high-performance computers make it possible now to attempt anatomically based computational (distributive) models rather than the lumped models used in the past, where the anatomical details of the coronary vascular system were ignored. Computer simulation and modeling are an important tool in this work because experimental avenues to the problem are highly limited, particularly in the circulation of the deeper layer of the heart which is not amenable to direct visualization. The mechanism of the effect of the cyclic contraction on coronary blood flow remains unresolved. This review will consider the major cardiac mechanical interactions with coronary blood flow including previous models, current hypotheses, and future directions. Experimental validation of present and future mechanical interaction models will be emphasized as well as the utility of the models to explain the mechanical propensity of the subendocardium to ischemia."
Evaluation of an in vitro sulphidoleukotriene release test for diagnosis of insect bite hypersensitivity in horses,EQUINE VETERINARY JOURNAL,"Reasons for performing study: Insect bite hypersensitivity (IBH) is an IgE-mediated allergic dermatitis caused by bites of Culicoides and Simulium species, and improved means of diagnosis are required. Objectives: The cellular antigen simulation test (CAST (R)) with C. nubeculosus and S. vittatum extracts was assessed in a population of IBH-affected and healthy horses. Variations in test results over a one year period and possible cross-reactivity between different insect extracts was studied. Methods: A total of 314 mature horses were studied using the CAST. Influence of severity of clinical signs, gender and age were evaluated, and 32 horses were tested repeatedly over one year. The kappa reliability test was used to assess agreement of the test results with different insect extracts. Results: Horses with 11111 had significantly higher sLT release than controls with C. nubeculosus and S. vittatum. The highest diagnostic sensitivity and specificity levels were attained when using adult C. nubeculosus extracts with the CAST (78% and 97%, respectively), suggesting that most horses with IBH are sensitised against Culicoides allergens. A proportion of IBH-affected horses was found to be sensitised to allergens of Simulium spp. in addition to those of C. nubeculosus. The CAST with C. nubeculosus had positive and negative predictive values >= 80% for a true prevalence of IBH of 12-52%. In the follow-up study, the proportion of IBH-affected horses with a positive test result ranged from 90% in November to 68% in March. Severity of clinical signs or age did not influence test results significantly. However, IBH-affected males achieved significantly more positive test results than IBH-affected females. Conclusions: The CAST with adult C. nubeculosus has high specificity and good sensitivity for diagnosis of IBH. Horses with IBH are mainly sensitised to Culicoides allergens, and some horses are additionally also sensitised to allergens in Simulium spp. Potential relevance: The CAST is likely to be a useful test for diagnosis of IBH, even allowing the identification of IBH-affected but asymptomatic horses. This test may also help in further characterisation of allergens involved in this condition."
A median-based test under informative dropout: The one-sample case,CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS,"We consider a clinical trial in which the outcome can be assessed by a continuous measure and where dropouts tend to have poorer efficacy than completers. When each subject can act as his/her own control, efficacy is measured by the difference between the outcome measurements at two times. When all subjects complete the protocol, a paired t-test can be used to test for a treatment effect, i.e., whether or not the mean difference is zero. When a patient does not return for the final evaluation, a measure of efficacy cannot be computed for that subject. Often, data from dropouts are ignored and only the observed pairs are used to analyze the data. When the reason for dropping out is not random, the result may be misleading. In this paper, we assume that (1) the distribution of the measure of efficacy (i.e., the change between two outcome measurements) is Gaussian, (2) dropouts would have worse efficacy than the median if they were observed, and (3) the dropout rate is less than 50%. We propose a median-based t-like statistic using the sample median in place of the sample mean. The variance of the median is estimated using only data from the complete half-sample, i.e., the half-sample with better efficacy. Simulations under five patterns of dropouts are performed to compare the proposed statistic with the paired t-test. The results show that the median-based statistic provides a conservative bound for the test of significance of the treatment. Ln contrast, because the paired t-test does not preserve its level of significance, except when the dropout mechanism is uniform, the paired t-test should not be used for trials in which dropouts tend to have poorer efficacy than completers.

Artifacts in pulse transit time measurements using standard patient monitoring equipment,PLOS ONE,"Objective Pulse transit time (PTT) refers to the time it takes a pulse wave to travel between two arterial sites. PTT can be estimated, amongst others, using the electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG). Because we observed a sawtooth artifact in the PTT while using standard patient monitoring equipment for ECG and PPG, we explored the reasons for this artifact. Methods PPG and ECG were simulated at a heartrate of both 100 and 160 beats per minute while using a Masimo PPG post-processing module and a Philips patient monitor setup at the neonatal intensive care unit. Two different post-processing modules were used. PTT was defined as the difference between the R-peak in the ECG and the point of 50% increase in the PPG. Results A sawtooth artifact was seen in all simulations. Both length (59.2 to 72.4 s) and amplitude (30.8 to 36.0 ms) of the sawtooth were dependent on the post-processing module used. Furthermore, the absolute PTT value differed up to 250 ms depending on post-processing module and heart rate. The sawtooth occurred because the PPG wave continuously showed a minimal prolongation during the length of the sawtooth, followed by a sudden shortening. Both artifacts were generated in the post-processing module containing Masimo algorithms. Conclusion Post-processing of the PPG signal in the Masimo module of the Philips patient monitor introduces a sawtooth in PPG and derived PTT. This sawtooth, together with a large module-dependent absolute difference in PTT, renders the thus-derived PTT insufficient for clinical purposes."
Analysis of three leakage-correction methods for DSC-based measurement of relative cerebral blood volume with respect to heterogeneity. in human gliomas,MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING,"Purpose: Aim of this study was to investigate the influence of contrast agent leakage on relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), using clinical dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) protocols. Different correction methods were compared, in order to identify a clinically reliable method. Materials and methods: DSC perfusion data from patients with glioma were acquired with a single-shot EPI technique at 3.0 T using a pre-dose. Three different post-processing methods for leakage correction were compared, concerning rCBV, the permeability related parameter K-2 and the predominant leakage effect in tumor regions (T1 effect: K-2 > 0; T2* effect: K-2 < 0). Additionally, simulations were performed, to investigate the influence of noise and input curve modifications on correction results. Results: Our results indicate several differences between post -processing methods with regard to rCBV values, reflected by the fact that the distribution of detected leakage effects and the correction strength differed between methods. Leakage was heterogeneous within tumorous tissue and between patients, with a general predominance of T2* effects but an increased amount of T1 effects in low grade glioma. Simulations confirmed differential dependencies on signal-to-noise ratios, mean transit times and input curves as possible reasons. Conclusion: The impact of leakage is complex, thus adequate correction necessitates care. Standardized input parameters are one important factor for comparability of rCBV and K-2 values among patients. The extension of DSC analysis with K-2 maps could potentially allow improved differentiation between tumor grades. Further methods need to integrate special advantages of existing approaches to achieve more reliable rCBV estimates within clinically reasonable calculation times. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Approximating anatomically-guided PET reconstruction in image space using a convolutional neural network,NEUROIMAGE,"In the last two decades, it has been shown that anatomically-guided PET reconstruction can lead to improved bias-noise characteristics in brain PET imaging. However, despite promising results in simulations and first studies, anatomically-guided PET reconstructions are not yet available for use in routine clinical because of several reasons. In light of this, we investigate whether the improvements of anatomically-guided PET reconstruction methods can be achieved entirely in the image domain with a convolutional neural network (CNN). An entirely image-based CNN post-reconstruction approach has the advantage that no access to PET raw data is needed and, moreover, that the prediction times of trained CNNs are extremely fast on state of the art GPUs which will substantially facilitate the evaluation, fine-tuning and application of anatomically-guided PET reconstruction in real-world clinical settings. In this work, we demonstrate that anatomically-guided PET reconstruction using the asymmetric Bowsher prior can be well-approximated by a purely shift-invariant convolutional neural network in image space allowing the generation of anatomically-guided PET images in almost real-time. We show that by applying dedicated data augmentation techniques in the training phase, in which 16 [F-18]FDG and 10 [(18) F]PE2I data sets were used, lead to a CNN that is robust against the used PET tracer, the noise level of the input PET images and the input MRI contrast. A detailed analysis of our CNN in 36 [F-18]FDG, 18 [(18) F]PE2I, and 7 [(18) F]FET test data sets demonstrates that the image quality of our trained CNN is very close to the one of the target reconstructions in terms of regional mean recovery and regional structural similarity."
"Post-event debriefings during neonatal care: why are we not doing them, and how can we start?",JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY,"Post-event debriefings are a foundational behavior of high performing teams. Despite the inherent value of post-event debriefings, the frequency with which they are used in neonatal care is extremely low. If post-event debriefings are so beneficial, why aren't they conducted more frequently? The reasons are many, but solutions are available. In this report, we provide practical advice on conducting post-event debriefing in neonatal care. In addition, we examine the perceived barriers to conducting post-event debriefings, and offer strategies to overcome them. Finally, we consider opportunities to foster a culture change within neonatal care which integrates debriefing as standard daily work. By establishing a safety culture in neonatal care that encourages and facilitates effective post-event debriefings, patient safety can be enhanced and clinical outcomes can be improved."
Adaptive Radiation Therapy in the Treatment of Lung Cancer: An Overview of the Current State of the Field,FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY,"Lung cancer treatment is constantly evolving due to technological advances in the delivery of radiation therapy. Adaptive radiation therapy (ART) allows for modification of a treatment plan with the goal of improving the dose distribution to the patient due to anatomic or physiologic deviations from the initial simulation. The implementation of ART for lung cancer is widely varied with limited consensus on who to adapt, when to adapt, how to adapt, and what the actual benefits of adaptation are. ART for lung cancer presents significant challenges due to the nature of the moving target, tumor shrinkage, and complex dose accumulation because of plan adaptation. This article presents an overview of the current state of the field in ART for lung cancer, specifically, probing topics of: patient selection for the greatest benefit from adaptation, models which predict who and when to adapt plans, best timing for plan adaptation, optimized workflows for implementing ART including alternatives to re-simulation, the best radiation techniques for ART including magnetic resonance guided treatment, algorithms and quality assurance, and challenges and techniques for dose reconstruction. To date, the clinical workflow burden of ART is one of the major reasons limiting its widespread acceptance. However, the growing body of evidence demonstrates overwhelming support for reduced toxicity while improving tumor dose coverage by adapting plans mid-treatment, but this is offset by the limited knowledge about tumor control. Progress made in predictive modeling of on-treatment tumor shrinkage and toxicity, optimizing the timing of adaptation of the plan during the course of treatment, creating optimal workflows to minimize staffing burden, and utilizing deformable image registration represent ways the field is moving toward a more uniform implementation of ART."
A Bayesian approach to tissue-fraction estimation for oncological PET segmentation,PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY,"Tumor segmentation in oncological PET is challenging, a major reason being the partial-volume effects (PVEs) that arise due to low system resolution and finite voxel size. The latter results in tissue-fraction effects (TFEs), i.e. voxels contain a mixture of tissue classes. Conventional segmentation methods are typically designed to assign each image voxel as belonging to a certain tissue class. Thus, these methods are inherently limited in modeling TFEs. To address the challenge of accounting for PVEs, and in particular, TFEs, we propose a Bayesian approach to tissue-fraction estimation for oncological PET segmentation. Specifically, this Bayesian approach estimates the posterior mean of the fractional volume that the tumor occupies within each image voxel. The proposed method, implemented using a deep-learning-based technique, was first evaluated using clinically realistic 2D simulation studies with known ground truth, in the context of segmenting the primary tumor in PET images of patients with lung cancer. The evaluation studies demonstrated that the method accurately estimated the tumor-fraction areas and significantly outperformed widely used conventional PET segmentation methods, including a U-net-based method, on the task of segmenting the tumor. In addition, the proposed method was relatively insensitive to PVEs and yielded reliable tumor segmentation for different clinical-scanner configurations. The method was then evaluated using clinical images of patients with stage IIB/III non-small cell lung cancer from ACRIN 6668/RTOG 0235 multi-center clinical trial. Here, the results showed that the proposed method significantly outperformed all other considered methods and yielded accurate tumor segmentation on patient images with Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.86). In particular, the method accurately segmented relatively small tumors, yielding a high DSC of 0.77 for the smallest segmented cross-section of 1.30 cm(2). Overall, this study demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed method to accurately segment tumors in PET images."
Is the atrial high rate episode diagnostic feature reliable in detecting paroxysmal episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmias?,PACE-PACING AND CLINICAL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY,"The atrial high rate episode diagnostic in the Thera(R) pacemaker reports frequency, duration, and date/time of atrial tachyarrhythmias according to programmed criteria. The aim of the study tt as to validate the atrial high rate episode diagnostic feature. Episodes of atrial fibrillation recorded by Holter monitoring were compared to episodes detected bq the pacemaker. Forty five ambulatory (Holter) recordings were used for evaluation. Thirty of 45 ambulatory (Holter) recordings short ed sinus rhythm. On 4 of these 30 ambulatory (Holter) recordings, the Thera(R) detected 12 episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmias as false-positives (sinus rhythm was detected as atrial tachyarrhythmia). The main reason was far-field R and T wave oversensing. On 15 of 45 ambulatory (Holter) recordings, 125 episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmias were recorded. Ninety-three of these events also were detected by the pacemaker, while for 32 events the Thera(R) reported sinus rhythm. The main reason was that the episodes rr ere of too short duration. Therefore, the Thera(R) (programmed with detection rate 160 beats/min, detection beats 40, termination beats 10) was unable to detect atrial tachycardias. Software simulation of the diagnostic algorithm under several programming settings using the digitized Holter files demonstrated highly reliable detection of atrial tachyarrhythmias (sensitivity 98%, specificity 100%) when programmed as follows: defection rate 220 beats/min, detection beats 10, termination beats 20. It can be concluded that Thera(R)'s high rate episode monitor is a reliable tool for defection of atrial tachyarrhythmias, if programmed as recommended."
A Robust Method for Genome-Wide Association Meta-Analysis With the Application to Circulating Insulin-Like Growth Factor I Concentrations,GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) offer an excellent opportunity to identify the genetic variants underlying complex human diseases. Successful utilization of this approach requires a large sample size to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with subtle effects. Meta-analysis is a cost-efficient means to achieve large sample size by combining data from multiple independent GWAS; however, results from studies performed on different populations can be variable due to various reasons, including varied linkage equilibrium structures as well as gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. Nevertheless, one should expect effects of the SNP are more similar between similar populations than those between populations with quite different genetic and environmental backgrounds. Prior information on populations of GWAS is often not considered in current meta-analysis methods, rendering such analyses less optimal for the detecting association. This article describes a test that improves meta-analysis to incorporate variable heterogeneity among populations. The proposed method is remarkably simple in computation and hence can be performed in a rapid fashion in the setting of GWAS. Simulation results demonstrate the validity and higher power of the proposed method over conventional methods in the presence of heterogeneity. As a demonstration, we applied the test to real GWAS data to identify SNPs associated with circulating insulin-like growth factor I concentrations."
Agent-based model of inflammation and wound healing: insights into diabetic foot ulcer pathology and the role of transforming growth factor-beta 1,WOUND REPAIR AND REGENERATION,"Inflammation and wound healing are inextricably linked and complex processes, and are deranged in the setting of chronic, nonhealing diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). An ideal therapy for DFU should both suppress excessive inflammation while enhancing healing. We reasoned that biological simulation would clarify mechanisms and help refine therapeutic approaches to DFU. We developed an agent-based model (ABM) capable of reproducing qualitatively much of the literature data on skin wound healing, including changes in relevant cell populations (macrophages, neutrophils, fibroblasts) and their key effector cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF], interleukin [IL]-1 beta, IL-10, and transforming growth factor [TGF]-beta 1). In this simulation, a normal healing response results in tissue damage that first increases (due to wound-induced inflammation) and then decreases as the collagen levels increase. Studies by others suggest that diabetes and DFU are characterized by elevated TNF and reduced TGF-beta 1, although which of these changes is a cause and which one is an effect is unclear. Accordingly, we simulated the genesis of DFU in two ways, either by (1) increasing the rate of TNF production fourfold or (2) by decreasing the rate of TGF-beta 1 production 67% based on prior literature. Both manipulations resulted in increased inflammation (elevated neutrophils, TNF, and tissue damage) and delayed healing (reduced TGF-beta 1 and collagen). Our ABM reproduced the therapeutic effect of platelet-derived growth factor/platelet releasate treatment as well as DFU debridement. We next simulated the expected effect of administering (1) a neutralizing anti-TNF antibody, (2) an agent that would increase the activation of endogenous latent TGF-beta 1, or (3) latent TGF-beta 1 (which has a longer half-life than active TGF-beta 1), and found that these therapies would have similar effects regardless of the initial assumption of the derangement that underlies DFU (elevated TNF vs. reduced TGF-beta 1). In silico methods may elucidate mechanisms of and suggest therapies for aberrant skin healing."
Mechanism of failure of the Cabrol procedure: A computational fluid dynamic analysis,MEDICAL HYPOTHESES,"Sudden failure of the Cabrol graft is common and frequently fatal. We utilised the technique of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis to evaluate the mechanism of failure and potentially improve on the design of the Cabrol procedure. CFD analysis of the classic Cabrol procedure and a number of its variants was performed. Results from this analysis was utilised to generate further improved geometric options for the Cabrol procedure. These were also subjected to CFD analysis. All current Cabrol and variations of the Cabrol procedure are predicated by CFD analysis to be prone to graft thrombosis, secondary to stasis around the right coronary artery button. The right coronary artery flow characteristics were found to be the dominant reason for Cabrol graft failure. A simple modification of the Cabrol geometry is predicated to virtually eliminate any areas of blood stasis, and graft failure. Modification of the Cabrol graft geometry, due to CFD analysis may help reduce the incidence of graft thrombosis. A C shaped Cabrol graft with the right coronary button anastomosed to its side along its course from the aorta to the left coronary button is predicted to have the least thrombotic tendency.

Effect of imbalance and intracluster correlation coefficient in cluster randomization trials with binary outcomes when the available number of clusters is fixed in advance,CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS,"In some cluster randomization trials, the number of clusters cannot exceed a specified maximum value due to cost constraints or other practical reasons. Donner and Klar [Donner A, and Klar N. Design and analysis of cluster randomization trials in health research. Oxford University Press 2000] provided the sample size formula for the number of subjects required per cluster when the number of clusters cannot exceed a specified maximum value. The sample size formula of Donner and Klar assumes that the number of subjects is the same in each cluster. In practical situations, the number of subjects may be different among clusters. We conducted simulation studies to investigate the effect of the cluster size variability (kappa) and the intracluster correlation coefficient (rho) on the power of the study in which the number of available clusters is fixed in advance. For the balanced case (kappa=1.0), i.e., equal cluster size among clusters, the sample size formula yielded empirical powers close to the nominal level even when the number of available clusters per group (k*) is as small as 10. The sample size formula yielded empirical powers close to the nominal level when the number of available clusters per group (k*) is at least 20 and the imbalance parameter (kappa) is at least 0.8. Empirical powers were close to the nominal level when (rho <= 0.02, kappa >= 0.8, and k* = 10) or (rho <= 0.02, kappa=0.8, and k* = 20). (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Fast virtual deployment of self-expandable stents: Method and in vitro evaluation for intracranial aneurysmal stenting,MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS,"Introduction: Minimally invasive treatment approaches, like the implantation of percutaneous stents, are becoming more popular every day for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. The outcome of such treatments is related to factors like vessel and aneurysm geometry, hemodynamic conditions and device design. For this reason, having a tool for assessing stenting alternatives beforehand is crucial. Methodology: The Fast Virtual Stenting (FVS) method, which provides an estimation of the configuration of intracranial stents when released in realistic geometries, is proposed in this paper. This method is based on constrained simplex deformable models. The constraints are used to account for the stent design. An algorithm for its computational implementation is also proposed. The performance of the proposed methodology was contrasted with real stents released in a silicone phantom. Results: In vitro experiments were performed on the phantom where a contrast injection was performed. Subsequently, corresponding Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyzes were carried out on a digital replica of the phantom with the virtually released stent. Virtual angiographies are used to compare in vitro experiments and CFD analysis. Contrast time-density curves for in vitro and CFD data were generated and used to compare them. Conclusions: Results of both experiments resemble very well, especially when comparing the contrast density curves. The use of FVS methodology in the clinical environment could provide additional information to clinicians before the treatment to choose the therapy that best fits the patient. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Knowledge-driven computational modeling in Alzheimer's disease research: Current state and future trends,ALZHEIMERS & DEMENTIA,"Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) follow a slowly progressing dysfunctional trajectory, with a large presymptomatic component and many comorbidities. Using preclinical models and large-scale omics studies ranging from genetics to imaging, a large number of processes that might be involved in AD pathology at different stages and levels have been identified. The sheer number of putative hypotheses makes it almost impossible to estimate their contribution to the clinical outcome and to develop a comprehensive view on the pathological processes driving the clinical phenotype. Traditionally, bioinformatics approaches have provided correlations and associations between processes and phenotypes. Focusing on causality, a new breed of advanced and more quantitative modeling approaches that use formalized domain expertise offer new opportunities to integrate these different modalities and outline possible paths toward new therapeutic interventions. This article reviews three different computational approaches and their possible complementarities. Process algebras, implemented using declarative programming languages such as Maude, facilitate simulation and analysis of complicated biological processes on a comprehensive but coarse-grained level. Amodel-driven Integration of Data and Knowledge, based on the OpenBEL platform and using reverse causative reasoning and network jump analysis, can generate mechanistic knowledge and a new, mechanism-based taxonomy of disease. Finally, Quantitative Systems Pharmacology is based on formalized implementation of domain expertise in a more fine-grained, mechanism-driven, quantitative, and predictive humanized computer model. We propose a strategy to combine the strengths of these individual approaches for developing powerful modeling methodologies that can provide actionable knowledge for rational development of preventive and therapeutic interventions. Development of these computational approaches is likely to be required for further progress in understanding and treating AD. (C) 2017 the Alzheimer's Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

THE USE OF FDTD IN ESTABLISHING IN VITRO EXPERIMENTATION CONDITIONS REPRESENTATIVE OF LIFELIKE CELL PHONE RADIATION ON THE SPERMATOZOA,HEALTH PHYSICS,"Recent studies have shown that exposing human semen samples to cell phone radiation leads to a significant decline in sperm parameters. In daily living, a cell phone is usually kept in proximity to the groin, such as in a trouser pocket, separated from the testes by multiple layers of tissue. The aim of this study was to calculate the distance between cell phone and semen sample to set up an in vitro experiment that can mimic real life conditions (cell phone in trouser pocket separated by multiple tissue layers). For this reason, a computational model of scrotal tissues was designed by considering these separating layers, the results of which were used in a series of simulations using the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method. To provide an equivalent effect of multiple tissue layers, these results showed that the distance between a cell phone and semen sample should be 0.8 cm to 1.8 cm greater than the anticipated distance between a cell phone and the testes.

Interferon treatment for chronic hepatitis B or C infection: Costs and effectiveness,ACTA GASTRO-ENTEROLOGICA BELGICA,"Introduction: With recognition that resources are limited, health care payers and policy makers have increasingly turned toward economic analyses to determine whether particular therapies are an efficient use of economic resources. Both chronic hepatitis B and C infections can progress to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma over time. Interferon treatment has been shown to eradicate viremia, but only does so in a proportion of treated patients. It has potential side effects, has no proven long-term benefit on complications and is relatively expensive. Objective: To determine the cost-effectiveness of interferon treatment by estimating the lifelong economic and clinical outcomes associated with interferon therapy versus standard fare for patients with either chronic hepatitis B or C infection. Methods: Computer cohort Markov model simulation to project the lifelong impact of the loss of hepatitis B or C viremia resulting from interferon on cirrhosis, life expectancy, and costs. The natural history of hepatitis B and C was based on published studies. Efficacy estimates for the loss of viremia were based on meta-analysis of published data. Using a societal perspective, economic estimates were based on cost of care data for patients with hepatitis and from estimates regarding the frequency of health resource utilization provided by expert panels. Results: For 20 year old patients with either hepatitis B e antigen positive chronic hepatitis or histologically mild chronic hepatitis C infection, interferon should be cost saving, extending life and reducing lifetime expenditures and morbidity. Life expectancy should increase by 4.5 to 3.1 years for patients with chronic hepatitis B or C, respectively. Lifetime costs should be reduced on average by $ 6,300 to $ 6,900 for each patient treated with interferon. Conclusion: Chronic infection with hepatitis B or C can result in liver failure and death. Although only effective in a proportion of treated patients, interferon for chronic hepatitis appears to be an efficient use of societal resources so that economic reasons should not limit its use."
Are drug holidays a safe option in treatment of osteoporosis? - Insights from an in silico mechanistic PK-PD model of denosumab treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis,JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS,"Recent reviews by the clinical bone research community suggest caution with prescription of drug holidays for patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) treated with denosumab for an extended period of time. Main reasons for this suggestion are based on the fact that discontinuation of denosumab treatment leads to a relapse of osteoclastic bone resorption and a loss of bone mineral density (BMD) to pre-treatment levels at only 12-28 months. The question remains what is the best treatment option for cases where it is required to discontinue and/or reduce the drug dose and what are the consequences on BMD and bone turnover markers (BTMs). The latter questions are difficult to be addressed using clinical trials alone given the large number of parameter combinations involved to answer this problem. In this paper, we apply a recently developed in silico mechanistic pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK- PD) model of the effect of denosumab on bone remodelling in PMO. To address the above clinical relevant questions, we design a wide range of current and virtual treatment regimens to study the effect of drug holiday duration and therapy resumption on the evolution of BTMs, BMD and mineral content. Our numerical simulation results indicate the symptomatic effect of denosumab, which is lost once treatment is stopped. This effect is most clearly seen on rapid loss of BMD to pre-treatment levels 12 months after the last injection (8% and 3.6% per year in the lumbar spine and femoral neck, respectively). Also, we identify that independently of the duration of drug holiday (i.e. 12, 16 or 18 months) resuming treatment can restore BMD quite effectively. However, the latter result does not consider the possibility of potential fractures that can occur during the drug holiday. Finally, we identify a treatment case most promising for achieving maintenance of BMD and mineral content, while moderately increasing BTMs. The latter case uses no drug holiday, but reduces the most commonly prescribed denosumab dose (60 mg every 6 months) by half at same interval."
A Comparison of Microvascular Responses to Visible and Near-Infrared Lasers,LASERS IN SURGERY AND MEDICINE,"Background and Objective: Pulsed dye laser (PDL) is a commonly used treatment for Port Wine Stain birthmarks (PWS). However, deeper components of PWS are often resistant to PDL. Deeper penetrating lasers, including the long pulsed Neodymium: Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (Nd:YAG) laser have been used, but carry greater risk. This study evaluates the distinct blood vessel thermal responses to visible (595 nm) and near infrared (1,064 nm) lasers using animal and numerical models. Study Design/Materials and Methods: Blood vessels in the rodent dorsal skin chamber (DSC) were irradiated by a 595 nm PDL and a long-pulsed 1,064 nm Nd: YAG laser. Laser-induced immediate and 1-hour post-structural and functional changes in the vessels were documented. Numerical simulations were conducted using a 1,000 mu m depth SD mouse skin fold to simulate experimental conditions. Results: PDL irradiation produced immediate blood vessel hemorrhage. Modeling indicated this occurs due to preferential heating of the superior parts of large blood vessels. Nd: YAG irradiation resulted in blood vessel constriction; modeling indicated more uniform heating of vessel walls. Conclusion: PDL and Nd: YAG lasers result in distinct tissue responses. This supports different observable clinical treatment end points when using these devices. Vessel constriction associated with the Nd: YAG may be more difficult to observe and is one reason this device may carry greater risk. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
Assessing the Costs and Benefits of Insuring Psychological Services as Part of Medicare for Depression in Canada,PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES,"Objective: The study estimated costs and effects associated with increasing access to publicly funded psychological services for depression in a public health care system. Methods: Discrete event simulation modeled clinical events (relapse, recovery, hospitalizations, suicide attempts, and suicide), health service use, and cost outcomes over 40 years in a population with incident depression. Parameters included epidemiologic and economic data from the literature and data from a secondary analysis of the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey on mental health. Societal costs were measured with the human capital approach. Analyses estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio associated with improved access to psychological services among individuals not receiving adequate mental health care and reporting an unmet need for such care compared with present use of health services for mental health reasons. Results: Over 40 years, increased access to mental health services in a simulated population of adults with incident depression would lead to significantly lower lifetime prevalence of hospitalizations (27.9% versus 30.2% base case) and suicide attempts (14.1% versus 14.6%); fewer suicides (184 versus 250); a per-person gain of .17 quality-adjusted life years; and average societal cost savings of $2,590 CAD per person (range $1,266-$6,320). Publicly funding psychological services would translate to additional costs of $123,212,872 CAD ($67,709,860-$190,922,732) over 40 years. Savings to society would reach, on average, $246,997,940 CAD ($120,733,356-$602,713,120). Conclusions: In Canada, every $1 invested in covering psychological services would yield $2.00 ($1.78 to $3.15) in savings to society. Covering psychological services as part of Medicare for individuals with an unmet need for mental health care would pay for itself."
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Radiotherapy Supply,RADIOLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE,"Background. The impetuous entrance of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy in March 2020, after the onset and diffusion in China, found the health system widely unfit to face the large amount of infected patients. The matter of this investigation was to evaluate how pandemic fear and guidelines for limiting the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 virus could have impacted the regular supply of radiotherapy (RT) and the outcome of the treatments. Materials and Methods. From March 9, 2020, to May 29, 2020, a register has been established to record patients that cancelled or postponed the RT appointment. The reasons were as follows: (1) patients whose appointments were postponed by the staff according to national guidelines; (2) patients who asked themselves to postpone the appointment; (3) patients who interrupted the treatment for causes directly or indirectly related to the pandemic; (4) patients who cancelled their care path. Results. A total number of 277 patients started regular RT, and 384 respected their computed tomography (CT) simulation appointment, but 60 of them had alteration of their therapeutic pathway. Among these, 18 cancelled their appointment. 42 patients asked to postpone their procedure. Twenty-seven out of 42 adduced directly or indirectly SARS-CoV-2 infection-related reasons. Conclusions. The COVID-19 pandemic affected the regular RT delivery to oncologic patients, owing to the delay or cancellation of procedures with the likely effect to observe worsening of local disease control and reduced survival rates in the future."
Genetic fuzzy modelling and control of bispectral index (BIS) for general intravenous anaesthesia,MEDICAL ENGINEERING & PHYSICS,"Based on an adaptive genetic fuzzy clustering algorithm, a derived fuzzy knowledge model is proposed for quantitatively estimating the systolic arterial pressure (SAP), heart rate (HR), and bispectral index (BIS) using 12 patients and it validates them according to pharmacological reasoning. Also, a genetic proportional integral derivative controller (GPIDC) to adaptive three controller parameters and a genetic fuzzy logic controller (GFLC) to adaptive controller rules using genetic algorithms (GAs) were simulated and compared each other in a patient model using the BIS value as a controlled variable. Each controller was tested using a set of 12 virtual patients undergoing a Gaussian random surgical disturbance repeated with BIS targets set at 40, 50, and 60. Controller performance was assessed using mean absolute error (MAE) of the BIS target, the percentage of time with acceptable BIS control (PTABC), and drug consumption (DC). It was found that the MAE value of the BIS target was significantly lower (P < 0.05) and the values of PTABC and DC of BIS target were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in BIS targets set at 40 than at 50 or 60 in both GPIDC and GFLC. However, when compared with two controllers in terms of the values of MAE, PTABC, and DC each other in BIS targets set at 40, 50, and 60, there were no significant differences (P > 0.05). Furthermore, when the simulation results in these two controllers were compared with routine standard practice of 12 clinical trials (i.e., manual control) in BIS target set at 50, the values of PTABC in both GPIDC and GFLC groups were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than in the manual control group. In contrast, there were no significant differences (P > 0.05) for these three groups in terms of drug consumption. This indicates that either GPIDC or GFLC can control the BIS target set at 50 better than manual control, although the similar drug consumption is used. (c) 2005 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Evaluating risk, safety and efficacy of novel reproductive techniques and therapies through the EuroGTP II risk assessment tool",HUMAN REPRODUCTION,"STUDY QUESTION Can risks associated with novelties in assisted reproduction technologies (ARTs) be assessed in a systematic and structured way? SUMMARY ANSWER An ART-specific risk assessment tool has been developed to assess the risks associated with the development of novelties in ART (EuroGTP II-ART). WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY How to implement new technologies in ART is well-described in the literature. The successive steps should include testing in animal models, executing pre-clinical studies using supernumerary gametes or embryos, prospective clinical trials and finally, short- and long-term follow-up studies on the health of the offspring. A framework categorizing treatments from experimental through innovative to established according to the extent of the studies conducted has been devised. However, a systematic and standardized methodology to facilitate risk evaluation before innovations are performed in a clinical setting is lacking. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION The EuroGTP II-ART risk assessment tool was developed on the basis of a generic risk assessment algorithm developed for tissue and cell therapies and products (TCTPs) in the context of the project 'Good Practices for demonstrating safety and quality through recipient follow-up European Good Tissue and cells Practices II (EuroGTP II)'. For this purpose, a series of four meetings was held in which eight ART experts participated. In addition, several tests and simulations were undertaken to fine-tune the final tool. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS The three steps comprising the EuroGTP II methodology were evaluated against its usefulness and applicability in ART. Ways to improve and adapt the methodology into ART risk assessment were agreed and implemented. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Assessment of the novelty (Step 1), consisting of seven questions, is the same as for other TCTPs. Practical examples were included for better understanding. Identification of potential risks and consequences (Step 2), consisting of a series of risks and risk consequences to consider during risk assessment, was adapted from the generic methodology, adding more potential risks for processes involving gonadic tissues. The algorithm to score risks was also adapted, giving a specific range of highest possible risk scores. A list of strategies for risk reduction and definition of extended studies required to ensure effectiveness and safety (Step 3) was also produced by the ART experts, based on generic EuroGTP II methodology. Several explanations and examples were provided for each of the steps for better understanding within this field. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION A multidisciplinary team is needed to perform risk assessment, to interpret results and to determine risk mitigation strategies and/or next steps required to ensure the safety in the clinical use of novelties. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS This is a dynamic tool whose value goes beyond assessment of risk before implementing a novel ART in clinical practice, to re-evaluate risks based on information collected during the process."
"A solid water pelvic and prostate phantom for imaging, volume rendering, treatment planning, and dosimetry for an RTOG multi-institutional, 3-D dose escalation study",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS,"Purpose: With increased interest in 3-D conformal radiation therapy and dose escalation, it is necessary to provide advanced techniques to assure quality in treatment delivery. Multi-institutional trials for these newer treatment techniques require methods of verifying the consistency of treatments between the participating institutions. For this reason, a phantom was designed to address the quality and consistency of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 3-D prostate treatment protocol. Methods and Materials: A solid water pelvic and prostate phantom for imaging, volume rendering, treatment planning, and dosimetry applications for performing comprehensive quality assurance has been designed and fabricated. Its configuration was based upon CT slices obtained from a patient study. Individual slices were machined with corresponding contours of the prostate, bladder, rectum, and the left and right femurs. Most of the phantom is made of solid water (Gammex/RMI, Middleton, WI), while the femurs are made of bone-equivalent material. The CT numbers from patient images were used to adjust the solid water composition within the organ volumes, providing image contrast from the remainder of the phantom. Cylindrical insertion grooves are machined in the phantom to allow placement of ionization chambers and thermal luminal dosimeters (TLDs) for dosimetry applications. During imaging, the cavities are filled with rods fabricated from solid water material. Results: The phantom is being used to evaluate the consistency of a range of processes in radiation therapy simulation, planning, and delivery of 3-D-based treatments for prostate cancer. Conclusion: The ultimate study objective is to use the phantom to evaluate the accuracy and consistency of treatments delivered by institutions participating in national collaborative clinical trials involving 3-D conformal dose escalation.

Effects of partial circadian adjustments on sleep and vigilance quality during simulated night work,JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH,"In most situations, complete circadian adjustment is not recommended for night workers. With complete adjustment, workers experience circadian misalignment when returning on a day-active schedule, causing repeated circadian phase shifts and internal desynchrony. For this reason, partial circadian realignment was proposed as a good compromise to stabilize internal circadian rhythms in night shift workers. However, the extent of partial circadian adjustment necessary to improve sleep and vigilance quality is still a matter of debate. In this study, the effects of small but statistically significant partial circadian adjustments on sleep and vigilance quality were assessed in a laboratory simulation of night work to determine whether they were also of clinical significance. Partial adjustments obtained by phase delay or by phase advance were quantified not only by the phase shift of dim light salivary melatonin onset, but also by the overlap of the episode of melatonin production with the sleepwake cycle adopted during simulated night work. The effects on daytime sleep and night-time vigilance quality were modest. However, they suggest that even small adjustments by phase delay may decrease the accumulation of sleep debt, whereas the advance strategy improves subjective alertness and mood during night work. Furthermore, absolute phase shifts, by advance or by delay, were associated with improved subjective alertness and mood during the night shift. These strategies need to be tested in the field, to determine whether they can be adapted to real-life situations and provide effective support to night workers."
Implementing high value back pain care in private physiotherapy in Australia: A qualitative evaluation of physiotherapists who participated in an implementation to innovation system,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PAIN-REVUE CANADIENNE DE LA DOULEUR,"Objectives: Many barriers exist to delivering high-value care for people with low back pain (LBP). We have developed a multistrategy implementation system to overcome these barriers. Here we describe a qualitative evaluation of the experiences of private-sector physiotherapists implementing the system. Design: PRISM (Practice-based innovation and implementation system) is an iterative clinician-as-scientist implementation program, tailored here for acute and subacute LBP. PRISM integrates strategies from behavioral change, implementation, and educational science fields. Semistructured interviews, group discussion forums, and electronic questionnaires were used to collect data at multiple time points that were then analyzed using an interpretative descriptive approach. Participants: Six physiotherapists (purposive sample) practicing in private practice physiotherapy clinics in the Adelaide region, South Australia, were enrolled in the study. Interventions: Interventions included an educational pain science and care workshop incorporating self-regulated learning principles, a co-planned clinical pathway, an electronic decision support tool, development and support of a community of practice, case study simulations, audit and feedback, and collaborative problem solving and innovation for physiotherapists. Results: Participants' experiences and perceptions centered around five themes: (1) knowledge and skills training; (2) networking and mentoring; (3) a clear clinical pathway; (4) practical tools; and (5) data feedback. Participants appraised the implementation process positively but identified patient receptiveness as a challenge at times. Suggestions for improvement included streamlining/automating data collection forms and processes and providing more simulation opportunities. Conclusions: PRISM appears to be a promising approach to overcoming several barriers that prevent people with back pain from receiving high-value care. It consolidates and increases pain science knowledge and increases physiotherapist confidence in delivering high-value care. It appears to legitimize some current practices, enhance clinical reasoning and communication skills, extend knowledge in line with contemporary pain science, and facilitate the application of a biopsychosocial management approach. The high-level acceptance by participants provides a foundation for further research to test outcomes and delivery in different settings. Contribution of the article A quality improvement intervention designed to improve delivery of high-value care was well received by private practice physiotherapists. Physiotherapists particularly valued using experiential learning to improve fluency in communicating with, and educating patients about, contemporary pain science. A structured clinical pathway and tools guided physiotherapists on the basic elements of necessary care and allowed them to concentrate on higher levels of decision making and communication with patients.

Accuracy of the end-expiratory lung volume measured by the modified nitrogen washout/washin technique: a bench study,JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE,"Background The functional residual capacity (FRC) determines the oxygenating capacity of the lung and is heavily affected in the clinical context of the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Nitrogen-wash-in/wash-out methods have been used to measure FRC. These methods have rarely been validated against exactly known volumes. The aim of the study was to assess the accuracy and precision of the N-2 washout/washin method in measuring FRC, by comparing it with set volumes in a lung simulator. Methods We conducted a diagnostic bench study in the Intensive Care Unit and Radiology Department of a tertiary hospital in Switzerland. Using a fully controllable high fidelity lung simulator (TestChest (R)), we set the functional residual capacity at 1500 ml, 2000 ml and 2500 ml and connected to the GE Carestation respirator, which includes the nitrogen washout/washin technique (INview (TM) tool). FRC was then set to vary by different levels of PEEP (5, 8, 12 and 15 cmH(2)O). The main outcome measures were bias and precision of the TestChest (R) when compared to the results from the washout/washin technique, according to the results of a Bland Altman Analysis. We verified our findings with volumetric computed tomography. Results One hundred and thirty-five nitrogen-wash-in/wash-out measurements were taken at three levels of FIO2 (0.4, 0.5, 0.6). The CT volumetry reproduced the set end-expiratory volumes at the Simulator with a bias of 4 ml. The nitrogen-wash-in/wash-out method had a bias of 603 ml with acceptable limits of agreement (95% CI 252 to - 953 ml). Changes were detected with a concordance rate of 97%. Conclusions We conclude that the TestChest (R) simulator is an accurate simulation tool, concerning the simulation of lung volumes. The nitrogen wash-in/wash out method correlated positively with FRC changes, despite a relatively large bias in absolute measurements. The reference volumes in the lung simulator verified with CT volumetry were very close to their expected values. The reason for the bias could not be determined."
Use of clustering analysis in randomized controlled trials in orthopaedic surgery,BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY,"Background: The effects of clustering in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the resulting potential violation of assumptions of independence are now well recognized. When patients in a single study are treated by several therapists, there is good reason to suspect that the variation in outcome will be smaller for patients treated in the same group than for patients treated in different groups. This potential correlation of outcomes results in a loss of independence of observations. The purpose of this study is to examine the current use of clustering analysis in RCTs published in the top five journals of orthopaedic surgery. Methods: RCTs published from 2006 to 2010 in the top five journals of orthopaedic surgery, as determined by 5-year impact factor, that included multiple therapists and/or centers were included. Identified articles were assessed for accounting for the effects of clustering of therapists and/or centers in randomization or analysis. Logistic regression used both univariate and multivariate models, with use of clustering analysis as the outcome. Multivariate models were constructed using stepwise deletion. An alpha level of 0.10 was considered significant. Results: A total of 271 articles classified as RCTs were identified from the five journals included in the study. Thirty-two articles were excluded due to inclusion of nonhuman subjects. Of the remaining 239 articles, 186 were found to include multiple centers and/or therapists. The prevalence of use of clustering analysis was 21.5%. Fewer than half of the studies reported inclusion of a statistician, epidemiologist or clinical trials methodologist on the team. In multivariate modeling, adjusting for clustering was associated with a 6.7 times higher odds of inclusion of any type of specialist on the team (P = 0.08). Likewise, trials that accounted for clustering had 3.3 times the odds of including an epidemiologist/clinical trials methodologist than those that did not account for clustering (P = 0.04). Conclusions: Including specialists on a study team, especially an epidemiologist or clinical trials methodologist, appears to be important in the decision to account for clustering in RCT reporting. The use of clustering analysis remains an important piece of unbiased reporting, and accounting for clustering in RCTs should be a standard reporting practice."
Overall indices for assessing agreement among multiple raters,STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,"The need to assess agreement exists in various clinical studies where quantifying inter-rater reliability is of great importance. Use of unscaled agreement indices, such as total deviation index and coverage probability (CP), is recommended for two main reasons: (i) they are intuitive in a sense that interpretations are tied to the original measurement unit; (ii) practitioners can readily determine whether the agreement is satisfactory by directly comparing the value of the index to a prespecified tolerable CP or absolute difference. However, the unscaled indices were only defined in the context of comparing two raters or multiple raters that assume homogeneity of variances across raters. In this paper, we introduce a set of overall indices based on the root mean square of pairwise differences that are unscaled and can be used to evaluate agreement among multiple raters that often exhibit heterogeneous measurement processes in practice. Furthermore, we propose another overall agreement index based on the root mean square of pairwise differences that is scaled and extends the concept of the recently proposed relative area under CP curve in the presence of multiple raters. We present the definitions of overall indices and propose inference procedures in which bootstrap methods are used for the estimation of standard errors. We assess the performance of the proposed approach and demonstrate its superiority over the existing methods when raters exhibit heterogeneous measurement processes using simulation studies. Finally, we demonstrate the application of our methods using a renal study."
Pooled Open Blocks Shorten Wait Times for Nonelective Surgical Cases,ANNALS OF SURGERY,"Objective: Assess the impact of the implementation of a data-driven scheduling strategy that aimed to improve the access to care of nonelective surgical patients at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Background: Between July 2009 and June 2010, MGH experienced increasing throughput challenges in its perioperative environment: approximately 30% of the nonelective patients were waiting more than the prescribed amount of time to get to surgery, hampering access to care and aggravating the lack of inpatient beds. Methods: This work describes the design and implementation of an open block strategy: operating room (OR) blocks were reserved for nonelective patients during regular working hours (prime time) and their management centralized. Discrete event simulation showed that 5 rooms would decrease the percentage of delayed patients from 30% to 2%, assuming that OR availability was the only reason for preoperative delay. Results: Implementation began in January 2012. We compare metrics for June through December of 2012 against the same months of 2011. The average preoperative wait time of all nonelective surgical patients decreased by 25.5% (P < 0.001), even with a volume increase of 9%. The number of bed-days occupied by nonurgent patients before surgery declined by 13.3% whereas the volume increased by 4.5%. Conclusions: The large-scale application of an open-block strategy significantly improved the flow of nonelective patients at MGH when OR availability was a major reason for delay. Rigorous metrics were developed to evaluate its performance. Strong managerial leadership was crucial to enact the new practices and turn them into organizational change."
Alzheimer's disease: which type of amyloid-preventing drug agents to employ?,PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS,"The current paradigm in the amyloid hypothesis brands small beta-amyloid (A beta) oligomers as the toxic species in Alzheimer's disease (AD). These oligomers are fibril-like; contain beta-sheet structure, and present exposed hydrophobic surface. Oligomers with this motif are capable of penetrating the cell membrane, gathering to form toxic ion channels. Current agents suppressing precursor A beta cleavage have only met partial success; and to date, those targeting the peptides and their assemblies in the aqueous environment of the extracellular space largely fail in clinical trials. One possible reason is failure to reach membrane-embedded targets of disease 'infected' cells. Here we provide an overview, point to the need to account for the lipid environment when aiming to prevent the formation of toxic channels, and propose a combination therapy to target the species spectrum."
The value proposition in the widespread use of telehealth,JOURNAL OF TELEMEDICINE AND TELECARE,"Telehealth has great potential to improve access to care but its adoption in routine health care has been slow. The lack of clarity about the value of telehealth implementations has been one reason cited for this slow adoption. The Center for Information Technology Leadership has examined the value of telehealth encounters in which there is a provider both with the patient and at a distance from the patient. We considered three models of telehealth: store-and-forward, real-time video and hybrid systems. Evidence from the literature was extrapolated using a simulation, which found that the hybrid model was the most cost-effective of the three. The simulation predicted savings of $4.3 billion per year if hybrid telehealth systems were to be implemented in emergency rooms, prisons, nursing home facilities and physician offices across the US. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine which factors most affected costs and savings. For all three telehealth models, the highest sensitivities were to the cost of a face-to-face visit, the cost of a telehealth visit and the success rate of a telehealth visit, i.e. the proportion of telehealth visits that avoided the need for a face-to-face visit. Payers, providers and policy-makers should work together to remove the barriers to the adoption of telehealth in order to make it widely available to all."
Evaluation of anatomy based reconstruction for partial volume correction in brain FDG-PET,NEUROIMAGE,"FDG-PET contributes to the diagnosis and management of neurological diseases. In some of these diseases, pathological gray matter (GM) areas may have a reduced FDG uptake. Detection of these regions can be difficult and some remain undiscovered using visual assessment. The main reason for this detection problem is the relatively small thickness of GM compared to the spatial resolution of PET, known as the partial volume effect. We have developed an anatomy-based maximum-a-posteriori reconstruction algorithm (A-MAP) which corrects for this effect during the reconstruction using segmented magnetic resonance (MR) data. Monte-Carlo based 3-D brain software phantom simulations were used to investigate the influence of the strength of anatomy-based smoothing in GM, the influence of misaligned MR data, and the effect of local segmentation errors. A human observer study was designed to assess the detection performance of A-MAP versus post-smoothed maximum-likelihood (ML) reconstruction. We demonstrated the applicability of A-MAP using real patient data. The results for A-MAP showed improved recovery values and robustness for local segmentation errors. Misaligned MR data reduced the recovery values towards those obtained by post-smoothed ML, for small registration errors. In the human observer study, detection accuracy of hypometabolic regions was significantly improved using A-MAP, compared to post-smoothed ML (P<0.004). The patient study confirmed the applicability of A-MAP in clinical practice. Conclusion: A-MAP is a promising technique for voxel-based partial volume correction of FDG-PET of the human brain.

A Three-Dimensional Computer-Based Perspective of the Skull Base,WORLD NEUROSURGERY,"OBJECTIVE: To describe our designed protocol for the reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) models applied to various endoscopic endonasal approaches that allows performing a 3D virtual dissection of the desired approach and analyzing and quantifying critical surgical landmarks. METHODS: All human cadaveric heads were dissected at the Laboratory of Surgical Neuroanatomy of the University of Barcelona. The dissection anatomic protocol was designed as follows: 1) virtual surgery simulation systems, 2) navigated cadaver dissection, and 3) postdissection analysis and quantification of data. RESULTS: The virtual dissection of the selected approach, the preliminary exploration of each specimen, the real dissection laboratory experience, and the analysis of data retrieved during the dissection step provide a complete method to improve general knowledge of the main endoscopic endonasal approaches to the skull base, at the same time allowing the development of new surgical techniques. CONCLUSIONS: The methodology for surgical training in the anatomic laboratory described in this article has proven to be very effective, producing a depiction of anatomic landmarks as well as 3D visual feedback that improves the study, design, and execution in various neurosurgical approaches. The Dextroscope as a virtual surgery simulation system can be used as a preoperative planning tool that can allow the neurosurgeon to perceive, practice reasoning, and manipulate 3D representations using the transsphenoidal perspective acquiring specifically visual information for endoscopic endonasal approaches to the skull base. The Dextroscope also can be used as an advanced tool for analytic purposes to perform different types of measurements between surgical landmarks before, during, and after dissection."
Using disease symptoms to improve detection of linkage under genetic heterogeneity,GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY,"A major reason for the slow progress in identifying susceptibility genes for complex diseases may be that the clinical diagnoses used as phenotypes are genetically heterogeneous. This has led researchers to collect various phenotypes related to the diagnosis, such as detailed symptoms, in the hope that these measurements define more homogeneous disease sub-types, influenced by a smaller number of genes that will thus be more easily detectable. Latent class analysis can be used to define disease sub-types from multivariate symptoms under the assumption that the subjects are independent, an assumption that does not hold between members of the same family. We have recently developed a latent class model allowing dependence between the latent disease class status of relatives within nuclear families. In this paper, we propose approaches to use the resulting latent class probabilities in linkage analysis. We present results from a simulation study showing that the latent class approach can provide a substantial gain in power to detect disease genes over the standard heterogeneity approach of Smith and identity-by-descent sharing methods applied to the disease diagnosis. Taking into account familial dependence in the latent class model generally provides greater power than assuming independence. In an analysis of autism symptoms in families from the Autism Genetics Research Exchange, linkage signals obtained with latent class-derived phenotypes were stronger than those obtained using the original autism spectrum disorder diagnosis."
ON DIFFERING ASPECTS AND PERCEPTION OF CONSANGUINEOUS MARRIAGES,"ADVANCES IN SOCIOLOGY RESEARCH, VOL 6","Consanguineous unions are important because they are very common, accounting for approximately 10% of all marriages in the world. This prevalence is significantly higher than commonly perceived. Consanguinity is often associated with higher frequencies of congenital malformations and increased mortality among the offspring of such marriages. However, the harmful consequences of inbreeding may have been overestimated because the inherent taboos against consanguinity tend to bias the assessment of its genetic dangers. Inbreeding increases the speed of selection of many recessive and codominant alleles. Notably, among such alleles are alpha(+)-tthalassemia, hemoglobin C, and Duffy antigen negative red blood cells, which protect against the death from malarial parasites. alpha(+)-Thalassemia, the most common monogenic condition in humans, is conspicuously superimposed on both geographic distributions of P. falciparum and high rates of consanguinity in populations, which suggests a causal link. Computer simulation studies have shown that in regions where malaria is prevalent, inbred populations with alpha(+)-thalassemia grow faster than outbred populations. Whether this faster growth compensates the excess of deaths in consanguineous populations due to harmful recessives remains to be determined. Nonetheless, it is possible that in these regions, consanguinity was genetically beneficial and evolved as a survival strategy to counter high population mortality from malaria and perhaps other infectious diseases. In general, multiple social benefits are thought to be the reason for the persistence of high levels of consanguinity in populations. However, the social benefit theory does not explain why non-consanguineous societies, despite the same benefits, do not practice consanguinity. Furthermore, results of computer simulation of the genetic benefits of consanguinity fits into the historical conditions which existed during the agrarian revolution, when multiple epidemic infections emerged in rapidly enlarging populations. Besides malaria, this theory of genetic benefits is also applicable to many other infectious diseases like tuberculosis and HIV, the protection being due to the codominant MCP-1 and recessive CCR5 Delta 32 alleles, respectively. This article is an attempt to give a rational and objective view of consanguinity integrating different aspects from human genetics, history, psychology, anthropology and clinical medicine.

Long Waiting Times for Elective Hospital Care - Breaking the Vicious Circle by Abandoning Prioritisation,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT,"Background: Policies assigning low-priority patients treatment delays for care, in order to make room for patients of higher priority arriving later, are common in secondary healthcare services today. Alternatively, each new patient could be granted the first available appointment. We aimed to investigate whether prioritisation can be part of the reason why waiting times for care are often long, and to describe how departments can improve their waiting situation by changing away from prioritisation. Methods: We used patient flow data from 2015 at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Haukeland University Hospital, Norway. In Dynaplan Smia, Dynaplan AS, dynamic simulations were used to compare how waiting time, size and shape of the waiting list, and capacity utilisation developed with and without prioritisation. Simulations were started from the actual waiting list at the beginning of 2015, and from an empty waiting list (simulating a new department with no initial patient backlog). Results: From an empty waiting list and with capacity equal to demand, waiting times were built 7 times longer when prioritising than when not. Prioritisation also led to poor resource utilisation and short-lived effects of extra capacity. Departments where prioritisation is causing long waits can improve their situation by temporarily bringing capacity above demand and introducing first come, first served instead of prioritisation. Conclusion: A poor appointment allocation policy can build long waiting times, even when capacity is sufficient to meet demand. By bringing waiting times down and going away from prioritisation, the waiting list size and average waiting times at the studied department could be maintained almost 90% below the current level without requiring permanent change in the capacity/demand ratio."
Reference point insensitive molecular data analysis,BIOINFORMATICS,"Motivation: In biomedicine, every molecular measurement is relative to a reference point, like a fixed aliquot of RNA extracted from a tissue, a defined number of blood cells, or a defined volume of biofluid. Reference points are often chosen for practical reasons. For example, we might want to assess the metabolome of a diseased organ but can only measure metabolites in blood or urine. In this case, the observable data only indirectly reflects the disease state. The statistical implications of these discrepancies in reference points have not yet been discussed. Results: Here, we show that reference point discrepancies compromise the performance of regression models like the LASSO. As an alternative, we suggest zero-sum regression for a reference point insensitive analysis. We show that zero-sum regression is superior to the LASSO in case of a poor choice of reference point both in simulations and in an application that integrates intestinal microbiome analysis with metabolomics. Moreover, we describe a novel coordinate descent based algorithm to fit zero-sum elastic nets."
"Adverse drug reaction management in hospital settings: review on practice variations, quality indicators and education focus",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,"Purpose Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) contribute significantly to healthcare burden. However, they are largely preventable through appropriate management processes. This narrative review aims to identify the quality indicators that should be considered for routine monitoring of processes within hospital ADR management systems. It also examines the potential reasons behind variation in ADR management practices amongst HCPs, and explores possible solutions, focusing on targeted education programmes, to improve both the quality and quantity indicators of ADR management processes. Methods A comprehensive literature review was conducted to explore relevant themes and topics concerning ADR management, quality indicators and educational interventions. Results Substantial variability exists in ADR management amongst healthcare professionals (HCPs) with regard to reporting rates, characteristics of ADRs reported, quality of assessment, completeness of reports and, most importantly, risk communication practices. These variable practices not only threaten patient safety but also undermine pharmacovigilance processes. To date, quality indicators to monitor ADR management practices within hospital settings remain ill-defined. Furthermore, evidence behind effective interventions, especially in the form of targeted education strategies, to improve the quality of ADR management remains limited. Conclusions The focus of ADR management in hospitals should be to promote patient safety through comprehensive assessment, risk communication and safe prescribing. There is a need to develop a system to define, measure and monitor the quality of ADR management. Educational strategies may help improve the quality of ADR management processes."
Nonparametric identification and estimation of current status data in the presence of death,STATISTICA NEERLANDICA,"We present a nonparametric study of current status data in the presence of death. Such data arise from biomedical investigations in which patients are examined for the onset of a certain disease, for example, tumor progression, but may die before the examination. A key difference between such studies on human subjects and the survival-sacrifice model in animal carcinogenicity experiments is that, due to ethical and perhaps technical reasons, deceased human subjects are not examined, so that the information on their disease status is lost. We show that, for current status data with death, only the overall and disease-free survival functions can be identified, whereas the cumulative incidence of the disease is not identifiable. We describe a fast and stable algorithm to estimate the disease-free survival function by maximizing a pseudo-likelihood with plug-in estimates for the overall survival rates. It is then proved that the global rate of convergence for the nonparametric maximum pseudo-likelihood estimator is equal to O-p(n(-1/3)) or the convergence rate of the estimated overall survival function, whichever is slower. Simulation studies show that the nonparametric maximum pseudo-likelihood estimators are fairly accurate in small- to medium-sized samples. Real data from breast cancer studies are analyzed as an illustration."
Rotational and hinge dynamics of discoidal high density lipoproteins probed by interchain disulfide bond formation,BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR AND CELL BIOLOGY OF LIPIDS,"To develop a detailed double belt model for discoidal HDL, we previously scored inter-helical salt bridges between all possible registries of two stacked antiparallel amphipathic helical rings of apolipoprotein (apo) A-I. The top score was the antiparallel apposition of helix 5 with 5 followed closely by appositions of helix 5 with 4 and helix 5 with 6. The rationale for the current study is that, for each of the optimal scores, a pair of identical residues can be identified in juxtaposition directly on the contact edge between the two antiparallel helical belts of apoA-I. Further, these residues are always in the '9th position' in one of the eighteen 11-mer repeats that make up the lipid-associating domain of apoA-I. To illustrate our terminology, 129j (LL5/5) refers to the juxtaposition of the C alpha atoms of G129 (in a '9th position') in the pairwise helix 5 domains. We reasoned that if identical residues in the double belt juxtapositions were mutated to a cysteine and kept under reducing conditions during disc formation, we would have a precise method for determining registration in discoidal HDL by formation of a disulfide-linked apoA-I homodimer. Using this approach, we conclude that 129j (LL5/5) is the major rotamer orientation for double belt HDL and propose that the small ubiquitous gap between the pairwise helix 5 portions of the double belt in larger HDL discoidal particles is significantly dynamic to hinge off the disc edge under certain conditions, e.g., in smaller particles or perhaps following binding of the enzyme LCAT.

Measurements to predict the time of target replacement of a helical tomotherapy,JOURNAL OF APPLIED CLINICAL MEDICAL PHYSICS,"Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) requires more beam-on time than normal open field treatment. Consequently, the machines wear out and need more spare parts. A helical tomotherapy treatment unit needs a periodical tungsten target replacement, which is a time consuming event. To be able to predict the next replacement would be quite valuable. We observed unexpected variations towards the end of the target lifetime in the performed pretreatment measurements for patient plan verification. Thus, we retrospectively analyze the measurements of our quality assurance program. The time dependence of the quotient of two simultaneous dose measurements at different depths within a phantom for a fixed open field irradiation is evaluated. We also assess the time-dependent changes of an IMRT plan measurement and of a relative depth dose curve measurement. Additionally, we performed a Monte Carlo simulation with Geant4 to understand the physical reasons for the measured values. Our measurements show that the dose at a specified depth compared to the dose in shallower regions of the phantom declines towards the end of the target lifetime. This reproducible effect can be due to the lowering of the mean energy of the X-ray spectrum. These results are supported by the measurements of the IMRT plan, as well as the study of the relative depth dose curve. Furthermore, the simulation is consistent with these findings since it provides a possible explanation for the reduction of the mean energy for thinner targets. It could be due to the lowering of low energy photon self-absorption in a worn out and therefore thinner target. We state a threshold value for our measurement at which a target replacement should be initiated. Measurements to observe a change in the energy are good predictors of the need for a target replacement. However, since all results support the softening of the spectrum hypothesis, all depth-dependent setups are viable for analyzing the deterioration of the tungsten target. The suggested measurements and criteria to replace the target can be very helpful for every user of a TomoTherapy machine."
Use of antibacterial agents in the neonate: 50 years of experience with vancomycin administration,SEMINARS IN FETAL & NEONATAL MEDICINE,"Neonatal sepsis, classified as either early or late onset, has specific pathogen distribution and infection rates in the different neonatal age groups. It is a major cause of mortality and morbidity and administration of antibiotics is urgently required for suspected or proven infection. Vancomycin is the first choice treatment of late onset sepsis due to resistant staphylococci. Although it has been used for more than 50 years, prescription remains a challenge in neonatal intensive care units for many reasons, including: high pharmacokinetic variability, numerous presentations, lack of consensus on dosing regimen and therapeutic drug monitoring. In addition, recent concerns about the increase in minimal inhibition concentration and other more generic problems have prompted reappraisal of the rational use of vancomycin. This article highlights the goal of optimising vancomycin therapy in the neonate and discusses future research directions. Specific attention is given to dosing optimisation of vancomycin to avoid resistance and maximise the likelihood of achieving the therapeutic target. Modelling and simulation approaches have clear advantages in dosing optimisation of antimicrobial agents in the neonate. Neonatologists and paediatric pharmacologists should work closely together to achieve this goal. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
A Preliminary Study of Muscular Artifact Cancellation in Single-Channel EEG,SENSORS,"Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings are often contaminated with muscular artifacts that strongly obscure the EEG signals and complicates their analysis. For the conventional case, where the EEG recordings are obtained simultaneously over many EEG channels, there exists a considerable range of methods for removing muscular artifacts. In recent years, there has been an increasing trend to use EEG information in ambulatory healthcare and related physiological signal monitoring systems. For practical reasons, a single EEG channel system must be used in these situations. Unfortunately, there exist few studies for muscular artifact cancellation in single-channel EEG recordings. To address this issue, in this preliminary study, we propose a simple, yet effective, method to achieve the muscular artifact cancellation for the single-channel EEG case. This method is a combination of the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and the joint blind source separation (JBSS) techniques. We also conduct a study that compares and investigates all possible single-channel solutions and demonstrate the performance of these methods using numerical simulations and real-life applications. The proposed method is shown to significantly outperform all other methods. It can successfully remove muscular artifacts without altering the underlying EEG activity. It is thus a promising tool for use in ambulatory healthcare systems."
NONPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION OF PREGNANCY OUTCOME PROBABILITIES,ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS,"Estimating pregnancy outcome probabilities based on observational cohorts has to account for both left-truncation, because the time scale is gestational age, and for competing risks, because, for example, an induced abortion may be precluded by a spontaneous abortion. The applied aim of this work was to investigate the impact of statins on pregnancy outcomes using data from Teratology Information Services. Using the standard Aalen-Johansen estimator of the cumulative event probabilities suggested the medically unexpected finding that statin exposure decreased the probability of induced abortion and led to more live births. The reason was an early induced abortion in a very small risk set in the control group, leading to unstable estimation which propagated over the whole time span. We suggest a stabilized Aalen-Johansen estimator which discards contributions from overly small risk sets. The decision whether a risk set is considered overly small is controlled by tuning parameters which we choose using a cross-validated Brier Score. We show that the new estimator enjoys the same asymptotic properties as the original Aalen-Johansen estimator. Small sample properties are investigated in extensive simulations. We also discuss extensions to more general multistate models."
The need for ICU admission in intoxicated patients: a prediction model,CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY,"Context: Intoxicated patients are frequently admitted from the emergency room to the ICU for observational reasons. The question is whether these admissions are indeed necessary. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a model that predicts the need of ICU treatment (receiving mechanical ventilation and/or vasopressors <24h of the ICU admission and/or in-hospital mortality). Materials and methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study from a national ICU-registry, including 86 Dutch ICUs. We aimed to include only observational admissions and therefore excluded admissions with treatment, at the start of the admission that can only be applied on the ICU (mechanical ventilation or CPR before admission). First, a generalized linear mixed-effects model with binominal link function and a random intercept per hospital was developed, based on covariates available in the first hour of ICU admission. Second, the selected covariates were used to develop a prediction model based on a practical point system. To determine the performance of the prediction model, the sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive value of several cut-off points based on the assigned number of points were assessed. Results: 9679 admissions between January 2010 until January 2015 were included for analysis. In total, 632 (6.5%) of the patients admitted to the ICU eventually turned out to actually need ICU treatment. The strongest predictors for ICU treatment were respiratory insufficiency, age >55 and a GCS <6. Alcohol and other poisonings (e.g., carbonmonoxide, arsenic, cyanide) as intoxication type and a systolic blood pressure >= 130 mmHg were indicators that ICU treatment was likely unnecessary. The prediction model had high sensitivity (93.4%) and a high negative predictive value (98.7%). Discussion and conclusion: Clinical use of the prediction model, with a high negative predictive value (98.7%), would result in 34.3% less observational admissions."
Why Do Not Physicians Attend Hospital Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Training?,OPEN ACCESS EMERGENCY MEDICINE,"Introduction: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training is mandatory in most hospitals. Despite this, some hospital staff do not attend CPR training on a regular basis, but the barriers to training attendance are sparsely investigated. This study aimed to investigate CPR course attendance, barriers to participation, and possible initiatives to increase CPR course attendance. Methods: Physicians from one university hospital and one regional hospital in the Central Denmark Region were included. Questionnaires were handed out at daily staff meetings at departments of internal medicine and surgery. Results: In total, 233 physicians responded (response rate: 92%, male: 54%). Overall, 32% of physicians had not attended CPR training at the hospital. Mean (+/- standard deviation) time since the last CPR course participation was 17 (+/- 3) months. Frequent barriers to attending courses included not knowing when courses are conducted (70%) and where to sign up for training (45%). The majority (60%) of physicians responded that the reason why they prioritize course participation is to be professionally updated. In contrast, 16% stated that they had sufficient CPR skills and therefore CPR training was unnecessary. Physicians stated that the following factors would improve CPR training participation: an annual day protected (no clinical work) for course attendance (72%), use of short booster sessions (49%), shorter courses combined with e-learning (51%) and shorter courses held over 2 days (46%). Conclusion: One-third of physicians did not attend hospital CPR training at two Danish hospitals. Several barriers to course participation exist, of which course registration seems to be a crucial factor. Alternative CPR training methods may help improve training participation."
Windkessel model of hemodynamic state supported by a pulsatile ventricular assist device in premature ventricle contraction,BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE,"Background: Counter-pulsation control (CPC) by ventricular assist devices (VADs) is believed to reduce cardiac load and increase coronary perfusion. However, patients with VADs have a higher risk of arrhythmia, which may cause the CPC to fail. Consequently, CPC has not been applied by VADs in clinical practice. The phase-locked loop (PLL) algorithm for CPC is readily implemented in VADs; however, it requires a normal, consistent heartbeat for adequate performance. When an arrhythmia occurs, the algorithm maintains a constant pumping rate despite the unstable heartbeat. Therefore, to apply the PLL algorithm to CPC, the hemodynamic effects of abnormal heartbeats must be analyzed. Objectives: This study sought to predict the hemodynamic effects in patients undergoing CPC using VADs, based on electrocardiogram (ECG) data, including a wide range of heart rate (HR) changes caused by premature ventricular contraction (PVC) or other reasons. Methods: A four-element Windkessel hemodynamic model was used to reproduce the patient's aortic blood pressure in this study. ECG data from 15 patients with severe congestive heart failure were used to assess the effect of the CPC on the patients' hemodynamic state. The input and output flow characteristics of the pulsatile VAD (LibraHeart I, Cervika, Korea) were measured using an ultrasound blood flow meter (TS410, Transonic, USA), with the aortic pressure maintained at 80-120 mmHg. All other patient conditions were also reproduced. Results: In patients with PVCs or normal heartbeats, CPC controlled by a VAD reduced the cardiac load by 20 and 40%, respectively. When the HR was greater for other reasons, such as sinus tachycardia, simultaneous ejection from the heart and VAD was observed; however, the cardiac load was not increased by rapid cardiac contractions resulting from decreased left ventricle volume. These data suggest that the PLL algorithm reduces the cardiac load and maintains consistent hemodynamic changes."
Recombination in liquid-filled ionization chambers beyond the Boag limit,MEDICAL PHYSICS,"Purpose: The high mass density and low mobilities of charge carriers can cause important recombination in liquid-filled ionization chambers (LICs). Saturation correction methods have been proposed for LICs. Correction methods for pulsed irradiation are based on Boag equation. However, Boag equation assumes that the charge ionized by one pulse is fully collected before the arrival of the next pulse. This condition does not hold in many clinical beams where the pulse repetition period may be shorter than the charge collection time, causing overlapping between charge carriers ionized by different pulses, and Boag equation is not applicable there. In this work, the authors present an experimental and numerical characterization of collection efficiencies in LICs beyond the Boag limit, with overlapping between charge carriers ionized by different pulses. Methods: The authors have studied recombination in a LIC array for different dose-per-pulse, pulse repetition frequency, and polarization voltage values. Measurements were performed in a Truebeam Linac using FF and FFF modalities. Dose-per-pulse and pulse repetition frequency have been obtained by monitoring the target current with an oscilloscope. Experimental collection efficiencies have been obtained by using a combination of the two-dose-rate method and ratios to the readout of a reference chamber (CC13, IBA). The authors have also used numerical simulation to complement the experimental data. Results: The authors have found that overlap significantly increases recombination in LICs, as expected. However, the functional dependence of collection efficiencies on the dose-per-pulse does not change (a linear dependence has been observed in the near-saturation region for different degrees of overlapping, the same dependence observed in the nonoverlapping scenario). On the other hand, the dependence of collection efficiencies on the polarization voltage changes in the overlapping scenario and does not follow that of Boag equation, the reason being that changing the polarization voltage also affects the charge collection time, thus changing the amount of overlapping. Conclusions: These results have important consequences for saturation correction methods for LICs. On one hand, the two-dose-rate method, which relies on the functional dependence of the collection efficiencies on dose-per-pulse, can also be used in the overlapping situation, provided that the two measurements needed to feed the method are performed at the same pulse repetition frequency (monitor unit rate). This result opens the door to computing collection efficiencies in LICs in many clinical setups where charge overlap in the LIC exists. On the other hand, correction methods based on the voltage-dependence of Boag equation like the three-voltage method or the modified two-voltage method will not work in the overlapping scenario due to the different functional dependence of collection efficiencies on the polarization voltage.

Identification of breast cancer prognosis markers via integrative analysis,COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS,"In breast cancer research, it is of great interest to identify genomic markers associated with prognosis. Multiple gene profiling studies have been conducted for such a purpose. Genomic markers identified from the analysis of single datasets often do not have satisfactory reproducibility. Among the multiple possible reasons, the most important one is the small sample sizes of individual studies. A cost-effective solution is to pool data from multiple comparable studies and conduct integrative analysis. In this study, we collect four breast cancer prognosis studies with gene expression measurements. We describe the relationship between prognosis and gene expressions using the accelerated failure time (AFT) models. We adopt a 2-norm group bridge penalization approach for marker identification. This integrative analysis approach can effectively identify markers with consistent effects across multiple datasets and naturally accommodate the heterogeneity among studies. Statistical and simulation studies demonstrate satisfactory performance of this approach. Breast cancer prognosis markers identified using this approach have sound biological implications and satisfactory prediction performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
Economic aspects of mastitis: New developments,NEW ZEALAND VETERINARY JOURNAL,"Good udder health is not only important for the dairy farmer but, because of increasing interest of consumers in the way dairy products are produced, also for the dairy production chain as a whole. An important role of veterinarians is in advising on production diseases such as mastitis. A large part of this advice is given around the planning of management to maintain or improve the udder health status of a farm. Mastitis is a costly disease, due to losses (a reduction of output due to mastitis) and expenditure (additional inputs to reduce the level of mastitis). Worldwide, published estimates of the economic losses of clinical mastitis range from 61 to 97 per cow on a farm, with large differences between farms, e.g. in The Netherlands, losses due to clinical and subclinical mastitis varied between 17 and 198 per cow per year. Moreover, farmers tended to underestimate these costs. This indicates that for a large proportion of farms there are many avoidable losses. In order to provide good support to farmers' decision-making, it is important to describe the mastitis setting not only in terms of disease, e.g. incidence of clinical mastitis, but also in monetary terms; and to make good decisions, it is necessary to provide the dairy farmer with information on the additional expenditure and reduced losses associated with alternative decisions. Six out of 18 preventive measures were shown to have a positive nett benefit, viz blanket use of dry-cow therapy, keeping cows standing after milking, back-flushing of the milk cluster after milking a cow with clinical mastitis, application of a treatment protocol, washing dirty udders, and the use of milkers' gloves. For those measures that included a large amount of routine labour or investment, the reduced losses did not outweigh the additional expenditure. The advisor cannot expect that measures that are cost-effective are always implemented. Reasons for this are the objectives of the dairy farmer can be other than maximisation of profit, resources to improve the mastitis situation compete with other fields of management, risk involved with the decision, economic behaviour of the dairy farmer, and valuation of the cost factors by the dairy farmer. For all decision-makers this means that, although financial incentives do have an effect on the management of mastitis, it is not always sufficient to show the economic benefits of improved management to induce an improvement of management of mastitis."
Localization of Epileptogenic Zone With the Correction of Pathological Networks,FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY,"Patients with focal drug-resistant epilepsy are potential candidates for surgery. Stereo-electroencephalograph (SEEG) is often considered as the gold standard to identify the epileptogenic zone (EZ) that accounts for the onset and propagation of epileptiform discharges. However, visual analysis of SEEG still prevails in clinical practice. In addition, epilepsy is increasingly understood to be the result of network disorder, but the specific organization of the epileptic network is still unclear. Therefore, it is necessary to quantitatively localize the EZ and investigate the nature of epileptogenic networks. In this study, intracranial recordings from 10 patients were analyzed through adaptive directed transfer function, and the out-degree of effective network was selected as the principal indicator to localize the epileptogenic area. Furthermore, a coupled neuronal population model was used to qualitatively simulate electrical activity in the brain. By removing individual populations, virtual surgery adjusting the network organization could be performed. Results suggested that the accuracy and detection rate of the EZ localization were 82.86 and 85.29%, respectively. In addition, the same stage shared a relatively stable connectivity pattern, while the patterns changed with transition to different processes. Meanwhile, eight cases of simulations indicated that networks in the ictal stage were more likely to generate rhythmic spikes. This indicated the existence of epileptogenic networks, which could enhance local excitability and facilitate synchronization. The removal of the EZ could correct these pathological networks and reduce the amount of spikes by at least 75%. This might be one reason why accurate resection could reduce or even suppress seizures. This study provides novel insights into epilepsy and surgical treatments from the network perspective."
Passive load-deformation properties of human temporal muscle,JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS,"The passive load-deformation properties of the human temporal muscle applicable to computer simulations of the human head or the comparison of the temporal muscle to other graft materials are unexplored to date and it is unclear, if these properties depend on age, sex, post-mortem interval or body side. Eighty-eight fresh temporal muscle samples from 69 human cadavers (age range 4 months - 94 years) were investigated in a quasi-static tensile setup. For comparative reasons, 20 age-matched human temporal muscle fascia and scalp samples were tested in the same manner as the temporal muscle. Human temporal muscle showed an elastic modulus of 1.58 +/- 0.64 MPa, an ultimate tensile strength of 0.26 +/- 0.11 MPa and a strain at maximum force of 26.21 +/- 12.48%. These parameters were independent of sex (p > 0.88), side (p > 0.92) and post-mortem interval (p > 0.09). All passive load-deformation parameters of the human temporal muscle differed from temporal muscle fascia and scalp except for the strain at maximum force of the temporal muscle and scalp. Significantly different load-deformation properties of the human temporal muscle from temporal muscle fascia and scalp indicate the need for a separate simulation of these soft tissue layers in computational head models to reflect lifelike conditions. Contrary to other tissues such as scalp or temporal muscle fascia the biomechanical temporal muscle properties in head models may not require adjustments for sex, side and age based on the here-presented findings.

Analysis of clustered matched-pair data,STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,"Evaluation of the performance of a new diagnostic procedure with respect to a standard procedure arises frequently in practice. The response of interest, often in a dichotomous form, is measured twice, once with each procedure. The two procedures are administered to either two matched individuals, or when practical, to the same individual. A large sample test for matched-pair data is the McNemar test. The main assumption of this test is independent paired responses; however, when more than one outcome from an individual is measured by each procedure, the data are clustered. Examples of such cases can be seen in dental and ophthalmology studies. Variance adjustment methods for the analysis of clustered matched-pair data have been proposed; however, because of unequal cluster sizes, variability of correlation structures within a cluster (within paired responses in a cluster as well as between paired responses in a cluster), and unequal success probabilities among the clusters, the performances of some available methods are not consistent. This research proposes a simple adjustment to the McNemar test for the analysis of clustered matched-pair data. Method of moments is used to calculate a consistent variance estimator. Using Monte Carlo simulation, the size and power of the proposed test are compared to those of two currently available methods. To illustrate practical application, clustered matched-pair data from two clinical studies are analysed. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd."
Intensive insulin therapy in the ICU-reconciling the evidence,NATURE REVIEWS ENDOCRINOLOGY,"Hyperglycaemia during critical illness unequivocally correlates with adverse outcome. Three proof-of-concept randomized controlled trials have shown that preventing hyperglycaemia in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) reduces organ failure and mortality. A subsequent multicentre, randomized controlled trial found that targeting normoglycaemia in this patient population does not affect organ function differently than targeting an intermediate glucose level (7.8-10.0 mmol/l). However, an intermediate glucose target evoked less hypoglycaemia and, for currently unexplained reasons, also fewer deaths than a normoglycaemic target. Moreover, tolerating a caloric deficit, rather than providing nutrients parenterally, accelerated recovery from critical illness in the presence of normoglycaemia. Whether macronutrient restriction renders moderate hyperglycaemia less harmful remains to be investigated. Hence, if adequate monitoring tools and expertise are available, normoglycaemia remains the only proven effective target for insulin treatment of hyperglycaemia in ICU patients. However, if these conditions are not fulfilled in clinical practice, is an intermediate target range preferable? In the absence of hard evidence, common sense supports such an intermediate blood glucose target."
Protein phenotype diagnosis of autosomal dominant calmodulin mutations causing irregular heart rhythms,JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY,"The life-threatening group of irregular cardiac rhythmic disorders also known as Cardiac Arrhythmias (CA) are caused by mutations in highly conserved Calmodulin (CALM/CaM) genes. Herein, we present a multidimensional approach to diagnose changes in phenotypic, stability, and Ca2+ ion binding properties of CA-causing mutations. Mutation pathogenicity was determined by diverse computational machine learning approaches. We further modeled the mutations in 3D protein structure and analyzed residue level phenotype plasticity. We have also examined the influence of torsion angles, number of H-bonds, and free energy dynamics on the stability, near-native simulation dynamic potential of residue fluctuations in protein structures, Ca2+ ion binding potentials, of CaM mutants. Our study recomends to use M-CAP method for measuring the pathogenicity of CA causing CaM variants. Interestingly, most CA-causing variants we analyzed, exists in either third (V/H-96, S/I-98, V-103) or fourth (G/V-130, V/E/H-132, H-134, P-136, G-141, and L-142) EF-hands located in carboxyl domains of the CaM molecule. We observed that the minor structural fluctuations caused by these variants are likely tolerable owing to the highly flexible nature of calmodulin's globular domains. However, our molecular docking results supports that these variants disturb the affinity of CaM toward Ca2+ ions and corroborate previous findings from functional studies. Taken together, these computational findings can explain the molecular reasons for subtle changes in structure, flexibility, and stability aspects of mutant CaM molecule. Our comprehensive molecular scanning approach demonstrates the utility of computational methods in quick preliminary screening of CA- CaM mutations before undertaking time consuming and complicated functional laboratory assays."
Insulin signaling - mathematical modeling comes of age,TRENDS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY AND METABOLISM,"Signaling pathways that only a few years ago appeared simple and understandable, albeit far from complete, have evolved into very complex multi-layered networks of cellular control mechanisms, which in turn are integrated in a similarly complex whole-body level of control mechanisms. This complexity sets limits for classical biochemical reasoning, such that a correct and complete analysis of experimental data while taking the full complexity into account is not possible. In this Opinion we propose that mathematical modeling can be used as a tool in insulin signaling research, and we demonstrate how recent developments in modeling - and the integration of modeling in the experimental process - provide new possibilities to approach and decipher complex biological systems more efficiently."
The role of mechanoelectric feedback in vulnerability to electric shock,PROGRESS IN BIOPHYSICS & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,"Experimental and clinical studies have shown that ventricular dilatation is associated with increased arrhythmogenesis and elevated defibrillation threshold; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that (1) stretch-activated channel (SAC) recruitment and (2) geometrical deformations in organ shape and fiber architecture lead to increased arrhythmogenesis by electric shocks following acute ventricular dilatation. To elucidate the contribution of these two factors, the study employed, for the first time, a combined electro-mechanical simulation approach. Acute dilatation was simulated in a model of rabbit ventricular mechanics by raising the LV end-diastolic: pressure from 0.6 (control) to 4.2 kPa (dilated). The output of the mechanics model was used in the electrophysiological model. Vulnerability to shocks was examined in the control, the dilated ventricles, and in the dilated ventricles that also incorporated currents through SAC as a function of local strain, by constructing vulnerability grids. Results showed that dilatation-induced deformation alone decreased upper limit of vulnerability (ULV) slightly and did not result in increased vulnerability. With SAC recruitment in the dilated ventricles, the number of shock-induced arrhythmia episodes increased by 37% (from 41 to 56) and the lower limit of vulnerability (LLV) decreased from 9 to 7 V/cm, while ULV did not change. The heterogeneous activation of SAC caused by the heterogeneous fiber strain in the ventricular walls was the main reason for increased vulnerability to electric shocks since it caused dispersion of electrophysiological properties in the tissue, resulting in postshock unidirectional block and establishment of reentry.

Within-host influenza dynamics: A small-scale mathematical modeling approach,BIOSYSTEMS,"The emergence of new influenza viruses like the pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus in 2009 (A(H1N1)pdm09) with unpredictable difficulties in vaccine coverage and established antiviral treatment protocols emphasizes the need of new murine models to prove the activity of novel antiviral compounds in vivo. The aim of the present study was to develop a small-scale mathematical model based on easily attainable experimental data to explain differences in influenza kinetics induced by different virus strains in mice. To develop a three-dimensional ordinary differential equation model of influenza dynamics, the following variables were included: (i) viral pathogenicity (P), (ii) antiviral immune defense (D), and (iii) inflammation due to pro-inflammatory response (I). Influenza virus-induced symptoms (clinical score S) in mice provided the basis for calculations of P and I. Both, mono- and biphasic course of mild to severe influenza induced by three clinical A(H1N1)pdm09 strains and one European swine H1N2 virus were comparatively and quantitatively studied by fitting the mathematical model to the experimental data. The model hypothesizes reasons for mild and severe influenza with mono- as well as biphasic course of disease. According to modeling results, the second peak of the biphasic course of infection is caused by inflammation. The parameters (i) maximum primary pathogenicity, (ii) viral infection rate, and (iii) rate of activation of the immune system represent most important parameters that quantitatively characterize the different pattern of virus-specific influenza kinetics.

2D and 3D computer tomography and sinus graft analysis with various graft materials,JOURNAL OF LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF MEDICAL IMPLANTS,"Sinus grafting has been a routine surgical procedure since the 1970s. Computer tomography (e.g., SIM/Plant(TM)) is available for planning and simulation, but it has not been used to control the success and the long-term results of the planned surgery. The aim of this work was to apply a prospective examination method to determine (a) the extent to which the success of sinus grafting can be followed through to (two-dimensional) and so (three-dimensional) CT (computer tomography) reconstruction, (b) when choosing this method is worthwhile, and (c) how to visualize incorporating and transforming various graft materials. Twelve patients received 21 sinus graftings, with immediate implantation. Four 2D and 3D CT reconstructions were performed: (1) preoperatively, (2) 1-2 weeks postoperatively, (3) before loading, and (4) 1 year after completing prosthodontic treatment. The sinus grafts were composed of a mixture of HTR Bioplant(TM) polymer and autograft, or from a mixture of Algipore(R) (HA, hydroxyapatite) and autograft. In the bilateral cases, both sinus graft mixtures were used, one on each side. The posterior-anterior, the lateral, and the superior-inferior views provided the most useful information; the usefulness of serial images is very limited. Individual to and 3D CT reconstructions are proposed, however, in cases of extensive bone atrophy, if complications are expected, if complications arise during surgery, if healing is protracted, or if the documentation is important for other reasons. The long-term results of the two graft materials could be followed up extremely well. Both materials proved outstandingly suitable for sinus grafting."
Numerical investigations of the strain adaptive bone remodelling in the periprosthetic canine femur,BERLINER UND MUNCHENER TIERARZTLICHE WOCHENSCHRIFT,After surgical treatment of severe hip diseases with artificial joint prostheses aseptic loosening of the implants can occur. Unphysiologic load distribution in the periprosthetic femur and stress shielding by the prosthesis can result in bone remodelling processes. In particular a cutback of the bone mass is followed by an aseptic loosening of the prosthesis. In this context the understanding of bone remodelling processes in the prothetically treated femur is of outstanding interest for the optimisation of canine hip joint prostheses in the future. Therefore the main aim of this sudy was the numerical investigation on the change in the load distribution in the canine periprosthetic femur and the resulting bone remodelling after implantation of the cemented stem Biomchanique(R). The investigations within this study were carried out using the Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The calculated bone density of the periprosthetic femur and the evolution of the mass loss show relevant stress shielding areas in different analysis regions. Therefore possible regions of aseptic loosening are indicated particularly in the proximo-medial femur. The here demonstrated numerical results are in agreement with clinical findings. For this reason the FEA-based method is a valuable tool for the prediction of bone remodelling processes.
Exploring BSEP inhibition-mediated toxicity with a mechanistic model of drug-induced liver injury,FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY,"Inhibition of the bile salt export pump (BSEP) has been linked to incidence of drug-induced liver injury (DILI), presumably by the accumulation of toxic bile acids in the liver. We have previously constructed and validated a model of bile acid disposition within DILIsym (R), a mechanistic model of DILI. In this paper, we use DILlsym (R) to simulate the DILI response of the hepatotoxic BSEP inhibitors bosentan and CP-724,714 and the non-hepatotoxic BSEP inhibitor telmisartan in humans in order to explore whether we can predict that hepatotoxic BSEP inhibitors can cause bile acid accumulation to reach toxic levels. We also simulate bosentan in rats in order to illuminate potential reasons behind the lack of toxicity in rats compared to the toxicity observed in humans. DILlsym (R) predicts that bosentan, but not telmisartan, will cause mild hepatocellular ATP decline and serum ALT elevation in a simulated population of humans. The difference in hepatotoxic potential between bosentan and telmisartan is consistent with clinical observations. However, DILlsym (R) underpredicts the incidence of bosentan toxicity. DILlsym also predicts that bosentan will not cause toxicity in a simulated population of rats, and that the difference between the response to bosentan in rats and in humans is primarily due to the less toxic bile acid pool in rats. Our simulations also suggest a potential synergistic role for bile acid accumulation and mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) inhibition in producing the observed toxicity in CP-724,714, and suggest that CP-724,714 metabolites may also play a role in the observed toxicity. Our work also compares the impact of competitive and noncompetitive BSEP inhibition for CP-724,714 and demonstrates that noncompetitive inhibition leads to much greater bile acid accumulation and potential toxicity. Our research demonstrates the potential for mechanistic modeling to contribute to the understanding of how bile acid transport inhibitors cause DILI."
Synergistic effect of a stellate mesoporous SiO2@Au nanoprobe and coffee-ring-free hydrophilic-hydrophobic substrate assembly in an ultrasensitive SERS-based immunoassay for a tumor marker,JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C,"In the field of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based immunoassays utilizing a sandwich structure, one of the main barriers to overcome is the development of an immunoprobe and substrate with ultrahigh sensitivity and relatively good reproducibility. In this work, a novel gold (Au)-coated stellate mesoporous SiO2 (SMSiO2) hybrid structure was proposed and applied as an immunoprobe. It was noticed that the SMSiO2 matrix with an appropriate coating amount of Au nanoparticles (NPs) demonstrated a much higher SERS intensity than solid SiO2 (SSiO2)@Au NPs with an enhancement ratio of 2.6. Electromagnetic hot spots existed around the sharp edges and ultrasmall nanogaps of the multibranched SiO2 matrix were verified to be the main reason responsible for the conspicuous enhancement given by the simulation results. Meanwhile, a hydrophilic-hydrophobic SERS-active immunosubstrate was prepared by linking antibodies onto the hydrophilic Ag-deposited sandpaper assembled with hydrophobic-treated filter paper. Such a novel substrate maintained excellent SERS homogeneity with quite a low relative standard deviation (RSD) of 12.85% arising from the elimination of the coffee-ring effect. The constructed sandwich immunoassay structure using the developed immunoprobe and the substrate was successfully employed in a specific assay for the ferritin (FER) antigen and exhibited an extensive dynamic linear range from 1 x 10(-5) to 3 x 10(-13) g mL(-1) with an ultralow limit of detection (LOD) of 3.16 x 10(-14) g mL(-1). The simplicity and versatility of this strategy demonstrated its superior sensitivity for tumor markers and it can be expected to have potential practical application in the clinical diagnoses of cancer."
Contributions of HERG K+ current to repolarization of the human ventricular action potential,PROGRESS IN BIOPHYSICS & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,"Action potential repolarization in the mammalian heart is governed by interactions of a number of time- and voltage-dependent channel-mediated currents, as well as contributions from the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and the Na+/K+ pump. Recent work has shown that one of the K+ currents (HERG) which contributes to repolarization in mammalian ventricle is a locus at which a number of point mutations can have significant functional consequences. In addition, the remarkable sensitivity of this K+ channel isoform to inhibition by a variety of pharmacological agents and clinical drugs has resulted in HERG being a major focus for Safety Pharmacology requirements. For these reasons we and others have attempted to define the functional role for HERG-mediated K+ currents in repolarization of the action potential in the human ventricle. Here, we describe and evaluate changes in the formulations for two K+ currents, I-Kl and HERG (or I-K,I-r), within the framework of ten Tusscher model of the human ventricular action potential. In this computational study, new mathematical formulations for the two nonlinear K+ conductances, I-Kl and HERG, have been developed based upon experimental data obtained from electrophysiological studies of excised human ventricular tissue and/or myocytes. The resulting mathematical model provides much improved simulations of the relative sizes and time courses of the K+ currents which modulate repolarization. Our new formulation represents an important first step in defining the mechanism(s) of repolarization of the membrane action potential in the human ventricle. Our overall goal is to understand the genesis of the T-wave of the human electrocardiogram. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Unraveling the structural basis for the unusually rich association of human leukocyte antigen DQ2.5 with class-II-associated invariant chain peptides,JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2.5 (DQA1* 05/ DQB1* 02) is a class-II major histocompatibility complex protein associated with both type 1 diabetes and celiac disease. One unusual feature of DQ2.5 is its high class-II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP) content. Moreover, HLA-DQ2.5 preferentially binds the non-canonical CLIP2 over the canonical CLIP1. To better understand the structural basis of HLA-DQ2.5 ' s unusual CLIP association characteristics, better insight into the HLADQ2.5.CLIP complex structures is required. To this end, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of the HLA-DQ2.5.CLIP1 and HLA-DQ2.5.CLIP2 complexes at 2.73 and 2.20 angstrom, respectively. We found that HLA-DQ2.5 has an unusually large P4 pocket and a positively charged peptide-binding groove that together promote preferential binding of CLIP2 over CLIP1. An alpha 9-alpha 22-alpha 24-alpha 31-beta 86-beta 90 hydrogen bond network located at the bottom of the peptide-binding groove, spanning from the P1 to P4 pockets, renders the residues in this region relatively immobile. This hydrogen bond network, along with a deletion mutation at alpha 53, may lead to HLA-DM insensitivity in HLA-DQ2.5. A molecular dynamics simulation experiment reported here and recent biochemical studies by others support this hypothesis. The diminished HLA-DM sensitivity is the likely reason for the CLIP-rich phenotype of HLA-DQ2.5."
Frequency response of implantable blood pressure telemetry systems,CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PHARMACOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY,"P>1. Measurement of blood pressure via telemetry in a variety of animal species has become an indispensable part of cardiovascular physiology, drug development and safety pharmacology. 2. These telemetry systems use fluid-filled catheters, which differ from commonly encountered indwelling catheters by virtue of their short length, high durometer, variable inner diameter and the use of a gel interface at the distal tip. 3. Despite the widespread use of blood pressure telemetry, there is little information describing the frequency response of these systems. The frequency response is of importance because it determines how well the waveform dynamics, such as pulse pressure, are captured. 4. For this reason, we measured the frequency responses of commonly used telemeters manufactured by Data Sciences International (St Paul, MN, USA; namely PA-C10, PA-C40 and PA-D70) and Telemetry Research (TR43P). The mean (+/- SEM) -3 dB frequencies measured for the PA-C10, PA-C40, PA-D70 and TR43P telemeters were 57 +/- 2 Hz, 40 +/- 6 Hz, 32 +/- 2 Hz and 173 +/- 3 Hz, respectively. 5. Simulation of the devices' dynamic performance by applying their frequency responses to a high-fidelity recording of arterial pressure demonstrated that the devices have sufficient bandwidth to accurately record arterial waveform dynamics. Experiments were also performed to determine how routine laboratory use and maintenance of the catheter affects the frequency response of the telemeters. Provided no air bubbles were introduced, these showed that the telemeters' frequency responses were robust to the maintenance procedures of tip removal and gel application. 6. The frequency response measurements, combined with simulation results, demonstrate that the systems tested have adequate dynamic performance to record arterial pressure."
Embedding fundamental care in the pre-registration nursing curriculum: Results from a pilot study,NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE,"International evidence suggests nursing is not providing fundamental care consistently or adequately, resulting in poor outcomes for patients and healthcare systems. One possible reason for this inadequate care delivery is nursing education, with fundamental care often implicit or invisible in nursing curricula. To understand how best to teach fundamental care to pre-registration (pre-licensure) students, we developed and piloted a six-week intervention that incorporated into the first-year curriculum a more explicit focus on fundamental care. A conceptual fundamental care framework was used to guide students' learning, and clinical skills sessions were structured to reinforce the framework's conceptual understanding and enable students to practice delivering fundamental care in an integrated manner. The intervention's impact was explored via a pre-post survey and focus groups. The survey demonstrated that the intervention did not affect students' ability to identify patients' fundamental care needs; however, focus groups showed the intervention assisted students in understanding the complexity of fundamental care and its importance to patients' experiences. The pilot provides preliminary evidence on the importance of embedding fundamental care into nursing curricula early and explicitly, and emphasising the integrated nature of such care, particularly through structured debriefs, consistent terminology, and opportunities for students to experience care as a patient."
Insulin Signaling in Type 2 Diabetes EXPERIMENTAL AND MODELING ANALYSES REVEAL MECHANISMS OF INSULIN RESISTANCE IN HUMAN ADIPOCYTES,JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY,"Type 2 diabetes originates in an expanding adipose tissue that for unknown reasons becomes insulin resistant. Insulin resistance reflects impairments in insulin signaling, but mechanisms involved are unclear because current research is fragmented. We report a systems level mechanistic understanding of insulin resistance, using systems wide and internally consistent data from human adipocytes. Based on quantitative steady-state and dynamic time course data on signaling intermediaries, normally and in diabetes, we developed a dynamic mathematical model of insulin signaling. The model structure and parameters are identical in the normal and diabetic states of the model, except for three parameters that change in diabetes: (i) reduced concentration of insulin receptor, (ii) reduced concentration of insulin-regulated glucose transporter GLUT4, and (iii) changed feedback from mammalian target of rapamycin in complex with raptor (mTORC1). Modeling reveals that at the core of insulin resistance in human adipocytes is attenuation of a positive feedback from mTORC1 to the insulin receptor substrate-1, which explains reduced sensitivity and signal strength throughout the signaling network. Model simulations with inhibition of mTORC1 are comparable with experimental data on inhibition of mTORC1 using rapamycin in human adipocytes. We demonstrate the potential of the model for identification of drug targets, e. g. increasing the feedback restores insulin signaling, both at the cellular level and, using a multilevel model, at the whole body level. Our findings suggest that insulin resistance in an expanded adipose tissue results from cell growth restriction to prevent cell necrosis."
A new mathematical approach to the diffusion approximation theory for selective photothermolysis modeling and its implication in laser treatment of port-wine stains,LASERS IN SURGERY AND MEDICINE,"Background and Objectives: Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of light-tissue interactions and analytical solutions for the diffusion approximation theory have been used to determine the optimal laser wavelength and radiant exposure to treat port-wine stains (PWS). Both approaches suggest that optimal parameters are a wavelength of 585 or 595-nm with pulse times of 0.45-20 milliseconds. However, which parameters are optimal is still unclear. As differences in vessel size and in temperature distribution within vessels appeared to be the main reasons for the varied responses to the same laser treatments, we sought to develop a solution to the diffusion approximation in order to calculate temperature distribution and the resulting coagulation pattern within specific blood vessels. Study Design/Materials and Methods: The light and heat diffusion equations were simultaneously solved with the finite element method (FEM). The latent heat of evaporation was included in the thermal analysis. The temperature and coagulation patterns across specific blood vessels, within a heterogeneous medium, were calculated for laser wavelengths of 585 and 595-nm with clinical parameters. Results: At 1.2 mm deep, the calculations predicted that vessels ranging from 50 to 100 pm in diameter would be coagulated from top to bottom, small vessels (10 pm) would be spared, and vessels larger than 150 mum would be partially coagulated. Coagulation across vessels was more uniform for the 595-nm than for the 585-nm wavelength. Maximal temperatures did not exceed 100degreesC because of the inclusion of latent heat in the thermal calculations. Conclusions: To study laser treatments of PWS with the diffusion approximation, FEM is an effective method to calculate the coagulation patterns within specific blood vessels. To improve coagulation efficacy at 585 and 595-nm wavelengths, the radiant exposure should be increased without increasing the irradiance. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
Optimizing Temperature and Oxygen Supports Long-term Culture of Human Islets,TRANSPLANTATION,"Background: Islet transplantation is a promising treatment for type-1 diabetes; however, donor shortage is a concern. Even when a pancreas is available, low islet yield limits the success of transplantation. Islet culture enables pooling of multiple low-yield isolations into an effective islet mass, but isolated islets rapidly deteriorate under conventional culture conditions. Oxygen (O-2) depletion in the islet core, which leads to central necrosis and volume loss, is one of the major reasons for this deterioration. Methods. To promote long-term culture of human islets in PIM-R medium (used for islet research), we adjusted temperature (12 degrees C, 22 degrees C, and 37 degrees C) and O-2 concentration (21% and 50%). We simulated the O-2 distribution in islets based on islet O-2 consumption rate and dissolved O-2 in the medium. We determined the optimal conditions for O-2 distribution and volume maintenance in a 2-week culture and assessed viability and insulin secretion compared to noncultured islets. In vivo islet engraftment was assessed by transplantation into diabetic nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficiency mouse kidneys. We validated our results using CMRL 1066 medium (used for clinical islet transplantation). Results. Simulation revealed that 12 degrees C of 50% O-2 PIM-R culture supplied O-2 effectively into the islet core. This condition maintained islet volume at greater than 90% for 2 weeks. There were no significant differences in viability and function in vitro or diabetic reversal rate in vivo between 2-week cultured and noncultured islets. Similar results were obtained using CMRL 1066. Conclusions. By optimizing temperature and O-2 concentration, we cultured human islets for 2 weeks with minimal loss of volume and function."
Dominant negative inhibition data should be analyzed using mathematical modeling - re-interpreting data from insulin signaling,FEBS JOURNAL,"As our ability to measure the complexity of intracellular networks has evolved, it has become increasingly clear that we need new methods for data analysis: methods involving mathematical modeling. Nevertheless, it is still uncontroversial to publish and interpret experimental results without a model-based proof that the reasoning is correct. In the present study, we argue that this attitude probably needs to change in the future. We illustrate this need for modeling by considering the common experimental technique of using dominant-negative constructs. More specifically, we consider published time-series and dose-response data which previously have been used to argue that the protein S6 kinase does not phosphorylate insulin receptor substrate-1 at a specific serine residue. Using a presented general approach to interpret such data, we now demonstrate that the given dominant-negative data are not conclusive (i.e. that in the absence of other proofs, S6 kinase still may be the kinase). Using simulations with uncertainty analysis and analytical solutions, we show that an alternative explanation is centered around depletion of substrate, which can be tested experimentally. This analysis thus illustrates both the necessity and the benefits of using mathematical modeling to fully understand the implications of biological data, even for a small system and relatively simple data."
"Interaction of Cucurbit[7]uril with Oxime K027, Atropine, and Paraoxon: Risky or Advantageous Delivery System?",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES,"Antidotes against organophosphates often possess physicochemical properties that mitigate their passage across the blood-brain barrier. Cucurbit[7]urils may be successfully used as a drug delivery system for bisquaternary oximes and improve central nervous system targeting. The main aim of these studies was to elucidate the relationship between cucurbit[7]uril, oxime K027, atropine, and paraoxon to define potential risks or advantages of this delivery system in a complex in vivo system. For this reason, in silico (molecular docking combined with umbrella sampling simulation) and in vivo (UHPLC-pharmacokinetics, toxicokinetics; acetylcholinesterase reactivation and functional observatory battery) methods were used. Based on our results, cucurbit[7]urils affect multiple factors in organophosphates poisoning and its therapy by (i) scavenging paraoxon and preventing free fraction of this toxin from entering the brain, (ii) enhancing the availability of atropine in the central nervous system and by (iii) increasing oxime passage into the brain. In conclusion, using cucurbit[7]urils with oximes might positively impact the overall treatment effectiveness and the benefits can outweigh the potential risks."
Using longitudinal targeted maximum likelihood estimation in complex settings with dynamic interventions,STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,"Longitudinal targeted maximum likelihood estimation (LTMLE) has very rarely been used to estimate dynamic treatment effects in the context of time-dependent confounding affected by prior treatment when faced with long follow-up times, multiple time-varying confounders, and complex associational relationships simultaneously. Reasons for this include the potential computational burden, technical challenges, restricted modeling options for long follow-up times, and limited practical guidance in the literature. However, LTMLE has desirable asymptotic properties, ie, it is doubly robust, and can yield valid inference when used in conjunction with machine learning. It also has the advantage of easy-to-calculate analytic standard errors in contrast to the g-formula, which requires bootstrapping. We use a topical and sophisticated question from HIV treatment research to show that LTMLE can be used successfully in complex realistic settings, and we compare results to competing estimators. Our example illustrates the following practical challenges common to many epidemiological studies: (1) long follow-up time (30 months); (2) gradually declining sample size; (3) limited support for some intervention rules of interest; (4) a high-dimensional set of potential adjustment variables, increasing both the need and the challenge of integrating appropriate machine learning methods; and (5) consideration of collider bias. Our analyses, as well as simulations, shed new light on the application of LTMLE in complex and realistic settings: We show that (1) LTMLE can yield stable and good estimates, even when confronted with small samples and limited modeling options; (2) machine learning utilized with a small set of simple learners (if more complex ones cannot be fitted) can outperform a single, complex model, which is tailored to incorporate prior clinical knowledge; and (3) performance can vary considerably depending on interventions and their support in the data, and therefore critical quality checks should accompany every LTMLE analysis. We provide guidance for the practical application of LTMLE."
Xome-Blender: A novel cancer genome simulator,PLOS ONE,"The adoption of next generation sequencing based methods in cancer research allowed for the investigation of the complex genetic structure of tumor samples. In the last few years, considerable importance was given to the research of somatic variants and several computational approaches were developed for this purpose. Despite continuous improvements to these programs, the validation of their results it's a hard challenge due to multiple sources of error. To overcome this drawback different simulation approaches are used to generate synthetic samples but they are often based on the addition of artificial mutations that mimic the complexity of genomic variations. For these reasons, we developed a novel software, Xome-Blender, that generates synthetic cancer genomes with user defined features such as the number of subclones, the number of somatic variants and the presence of copy number alterations (CNAs), without the addition of any synthetic element. The singularity of our method is the morphological approach used to generate mutation events. To demonstrate the power of our tool we used it to address the hard challenge of evaluating the performance of nine state-of-the-art somatic variant calling methods for small and large variants (VarScan2, MuTect, Shimmer, BCFtools, Strelka, EXCAVATOR2, Control-FREEC and CopywriteR). Through these analyses we observed that by using Xome-Blender data it is possible to appraise small differences between their performance and we have designated VarScan2 and EXCAVATOR2 as best tool for this kind of applications. Xome-Blender is unix-based, licensed under the GPLv3 and freely available at https://github.com/rsemeraro/XomeBlender."
Postoperative Lead Movement after Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery and the Change of Stimulation Volume,STEREOTACTIC AND FUNCTIONAL NEUROSURGERY,"Introduction: Lead movement after deep brain stimulation may occur and influence the affected volume of stimulation. The aim of the study was to investigate differences in lead position between the day after surgery and approximately 1 month postoperatively and also simulate the electric field (EF) around the active contacts in order to investigate the impact of displacement on affected volume. Methods: Twenty-three patients with movement disorders underwent deep brain stimulation surgery (37 leads). Computed tomography at the 2 time points were co-fused respectively with the stereotactic images in Surgiplan. The coordinates (x, y, and z) of the lead tips were compared between the 2 dates. Eleven of these patients were selected for the EF simulation in Comsol Multiphysics. Postoperative changes of EF spread in the tissue due to conductivity changes in perielectrode space and due to displacement were evaluated by calculating the coverage coefficient and the Sorensen-Dice coefficient. Results: There was a significant displacement (mean +/- SD) on the left lead: x (0.44 +/- 0.72, p < 0.01), y (0.64 +/- 0.54, p < 0.001), and z (0.62 +/- 0.71, p < 0.001). On the right lead, corresponding values were: x (-0.11 +/- 0.61, ns), y (0.71 +/- 0.54, p < 0.001), and z (0.49 +/- 0.81, p < 0.05). The anchoring technique was a statistically significant variable associated with displacement. No correlation was found between bilateral (n = 14) versus unilateral deep brain stimulation, gender (n = 17 male), age <60 years (n = 8), and calculated air volume. The simulated stimulation volume was reduced after 1 month because of the perielectrode space. When considering perielectrode space and displacement, the volumes calculated the day after surgery and approximately 1 month later were partly overlapped. Conclusion: The left lead tip displayed a tendency to move lateral, anterior, and inferior and the right a tendency to move anterior and inferior. The anchoring technique was associated to displacement. New brain territory was affected due to the displacement despite considering the reduced stimulated volume after 1 month. Postoperative changes in perielectrode space and small lead movements are reasons for delaying programming to 4 weeks following surgery."
Estrogen profile- and pharmacogenetics-based lamotrigine dosing regimen optimization: Recommendations for pregnant women with epilepsy,PHARMACOLOGICAL RESEARCH,"During pregnancy, various physiological changes occur that can alter the pharmacokinetics of antiepileptic drugs, such as lamotrigine (LTG). Anticipating the change in LTG dose required to achieve a pre-pregnancy target concentration is challenging. This study aimed to develop a refined population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model of LTG in pregnant women with epilepsy (WWE) to identify factors explaining the variability in pharmacokinetics and to establish a model-informed individualized dosing regimen. On that basis, a coarsened model containing only clinical variables was also developed to examine its predictive performance compared to the refined model. In total, 322 concentration-time points from 51 pregnant WWE treated with LTG were employed to establish a refined PopPK model that included endogenous estrogen profiles, variants of candidate genes encoding LTG-metabolizing enzymes and -transporter proteins, and other clinical variables and a coarsened model that included only clinical variables, respectively. Data from an additional 11 patients were used for external validation of these two models. A nonlinear mixed-effect modeling approach was used for PopPK analysis of LTG. The standard goodness-of-fit method, bootstrap, normalized prediction distribution errors and external evaluation were adopted to estimate the stability and predictive performance of the candidate models. Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to compare the goodness of fit between these two models. A lower AIC indicates a better fit of the data and the preferred model. Recommended dosing regimens for pregnant WWE were selected using Monte Carlo simulation based on the established optimal model. In the refined PopPK model, the population mean of apparent LTG clearance (CL/F) in pregnant WWE was estimated to be 2.82 L/h, with an inter-individual variability of 23.6%. PopPK analysis indicated that changes in estrogen profile during pregnancy were the predominant reason for the significant variations in LTG-CL/F. Up to the 3rd trimester, the concentration accumulation effect of E2 increased LTG-CL/F by 5.109 L/h from baseline levels. Contrary to effect of E2, E3 as the main circulating estrogen in pregnancy with a peak value of 34.41 ng/mL is 1000-fold higher than that in non-pregnancy reduced LTG-CL/F by 1.413 L/h. In addition, the UGT2B7 rs4356975 C > T and ABCB1 rs1128503 A > G variants may contribute to a better understanding of the inter-individual variability in LTG-CL/F. LTG-CL/F was 1.66-fold higher in UGT2B7 rs4356975 CT or TT genotype carriers than in CC genotype carriers. In contrast, ABCB1 rs1128503 GG genotype carriers had only 71.9% of the LTG-CL/F of AA or AG genotype carriers. In the coarsened PopPK model, the gestational age was a promising predictor of changes in LTG-CL/F. When comparing these two models, the refined PopPK model was favored over the coarsened PopPK model (AIC = 30.899 vs. -20.017). Monte Carlo simulation based on optimal PopPK model revealed that the LTG dosage administered to carriers of the UGT2B7 rs4356975 CT or TT genotype required a 33-50% increase to reach the pre-pregnancy target concentration, and carriers of the ABCB1 rs1128503 GG genotype required a 33-66% lower dose of LTG than carriers of the ABCB1 rs1128503 AA or AG genotype. Changes in estrogen profile during pregnancy was a better predictor of variations in LTG-CL/F than gestational age. The developed model based on estrogen profile and pharmacogenetics can serve as a foundation for further optimization of dosing regimens of LTG in pregnant WWE."
A Bivariate Mann-Whitney Approach for Unraveling Genetic Variants and Interactions Contributing to Comorbidity,GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY,"Although comorbidity among complex diseases (e.g., drug dependence syndromes) is well documented, genetic variants contributing to the comorbidity are still largely unknown. The discovery of genetic variants and their interactions contributing to comorbidity will likely shed light on underlying pathophysiological and etiological processes, and promote effective treatments for comorbid conditions. For this reason, studies to discover genetic variants that foster the development of comorbidity represent high-priority research projects, as manifested in the behavioral genetics studies now underway. The yield from these studies can be enhanced by adopting novel statistical approaches, with the capacity of considering multiple genetic variants and possible interactions. For this purpose, we propose a bivariate Mann-Whitney (BMW) approach to unravel genetic variants and interactions contributing to comorbidity, as well as those unique to each comorbid condition. Through simulations, we found BMW outperformed two commonly adopted approaches in a variety of underlying disease and comorbidity models. We further applied BMW to datasets from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment, investigating the contribution of 184 known nicotine dependence (ND) and alcohol dependence (AD) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the comorbidity of ND and AD. The analysis revealed a candidate SNP from CHRNA5, rs16969968, associated with both ND and AD, and replicated the findings in an independent dataset with a P-value of 1.06 x 1003."
Exclusion of context knowledge in the development of prehospital guidelines: results produced by realistic evaluation,SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA RESUSCITATION & EMERGENCY MEDICINE,"Background: Prehospital work is accomplished using guidelines and protocols, but there is evidence suggesting that compliance with guidelines is sometimes low in the prehospital setting. The reason for the poor compliance is not known. The objective of this study was to describe how guidelines and protocols are used in the prehospital context. Methods: This was a single-case study with realistic evaluation as a methodological framework. The study took place in an ambulance organization in Sweden. The data collection was divided into four phases, where phase one consisted of a literature screening and selection of a theoretical framework. In phase two, semi-structured interviews with the ambulance organization's stakeholders, responsible for the development and implementation of guidelines, were performed. The third phase, observations, comprised 30 participants from both a rural and an urban ambulance station. In the last phase, two focus group interviews were performed. A template analysis style of documents, interviews and observation protocols was used. Results: The development of guidelines took place using an informal consensus approach, where no party from the end users was represented. The development process resulted in guidelines with an insufficiently adapted format for the prehospital context. At local level, there was a conscious implementation strategy with lectures and manikin simulation. The physical format of the guidelines was the main obstacle to explicit use. Due to the format, the ambulance personnel feel they have to learn the content of the guidelines by heart. Explicit use of the guidelines in the assessment of patients was uncommon. Many ambulance personnel developed homemade guidelines in both electronic and paper format. The ambulance personnel in the study generally took a positive view of working with guidelines and protocols and they regarded them as indispensable in prehospital care, but an improved format was requested by both representatives of the organization and the ambulance personnel. Conclusions: The personnel take a positive view of the use of guidelines and protocols in prehospital work. The main obstacle to the use of guidelines and protocols in this organization is the format, due to the exclusion of context knowledge in the development process."
A Hemodynamic Mechanism Correlating with the Initiation of MCA Bifurcation Aneurysms,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies have reported that MCA bifurcation aneurysms usually emerge on inclined bifurcations; however, the reason is unclear. We designed this study to explore hemodynamic mechanisms that correlate with the initiation of MCA bifurcation aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-four patients with unilateral MCA bifurcation aneurysms and 54 control patients were enrolled in this study after propensity score matching, and their clinical and CTA data were collected. We extracted the morphologic features of aneurysmal MCA bifurcations to build a simplified MCA bifurcation model and performed a computational fluid dynamics analysis. RESULTS: The presence of MCA aneurysms correlated with smaller parent-daughter angles of MCA bifurcations (P<.001). Aneurysmal MCA bifurcations usually presented with inclined shapes. The computational fluid dynamics analysis demonstrated that when arterial bifurcations became inclined, the high-pressure regions and low wall shear stress regions shifted from the apexes of the arterial bifurcations to the inclined daughter arteries, while the initial sites of MCA bifurcation aneurysms often overlapped with the shifted high-pressure regions and low wall shear stress regions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the initiation of MCA bifurcation aneurysms may correlate with shifts of high-pressure regions and low wall shear stress regions that occur on inclined MCA bifurcations."
A mathematical model for the proliferation of bacteria in the urinary bladder due to enlarged prostate,MEDICAL HYPOTHESES,"Urinary retention due to enlargement of the prostate (prostate hypertrophy) leads to increased proliferation of bacteria in the bladder. This in turn increases the infection rate. The reason is that the enlarged prostate presses on the urine channel and tends to close it. Thus the out flux of the bladder consists of repeatedly small amounts of fluid during a day. A mathematical dynamic model with differential equations is developed for the proliferation of bacteria in the urinary bladder (vesica urinary). The model accounts for how this proliferation is associated with varying amounts of mass of urine within the bladder. Parameters are estimated from published data and analytical and numerical results are presented. The relationships between the proliferation of bacteria within the bladder and the type of urinal out flux from the bladder are examined. The proliferation is shown to depend on the amount of mass of urine and the out flux of urine from the bladder. In the normal situation the bladder is drained successfully which also drains the bacteria. In the abnormal situation the bladder drains only partly. Despite frequent urination, substantial urine mass in the bladder on the average allows bacteria to proliferate and increase in number through time. The simulations depend on the numerical values of the parameters which again depend on the prostate condition of each mate adult under scrutiny. By determining the parameters for each mate, the dynamic model can be used as a powerful tool. by which the proliferation of bacteria in the bladder can be studied and controlled by different means. Three clinical advices are provided. First, try to achieve that the proliferation rate of bacteria in the bladder is as small as possible, e.g. through altering the pH or chemical composition within the bladder. Second, try to achieve that the out flux of urine from the bladder is substantial, through sufficient drinking. Third, try to achieve that the mass of urine in the bladder is as small as possible, through sufficient urination. The intrinsic parameters for each mate can be used to pinpoint the actual out flux during a day necessary to keep the number of bacteria in the bladder low. Suggestions for how to test the model are briefly presented. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Meta-analysis using individual participant data: one-stage and two-stage approaches, and why they may differ",STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,"Meta-analysis using individual participant data (IPD) obtains and synthesises the raw, participant-level data from a set of relevant studies. The IPD approach is becoming an increasingly popular tool as an alternative to traditional aggregate data meta-analysis, especially as it avoids reliance on published results and provides an opportunity to investigate individual-level interactions, such as treatment-effect modifiers. There are two statistical approaches for conducting an IPD meta-analysis: one-stage and two-stage. The one-stage approach analyses the IPD from all studies simultaneously, for example, in a hierarchical regression model with random effects. The two-stage approach derives aggregate data (such as effect estimates) in each study separately and then combines these in a traditional meta-analysis model. There have been numerous comparisons of the one-stage and two-stage approaches via theoretical consideration, simulation and empirical examples, yet there remains confusion regarding when each approach should be adopted, and indeed why they may differ. In this tutorial paper, we outline the key statistical methods for one-stage and two-stage IPD meta-analyses, and provide 10 key reasons why they may produce different summary results. We explain that most differences arise because of different modelling assumptions, rather than the choice of one-stage or two-stage itself. We illustrate the concepts with recently published IPD meta-analyses, summarise key statistical software and provide recommendations for future IPD meta-analyses. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Hidden allosteric sites and De-Novo drug design,EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG DISCOVERY,"Introduction Hidden allosteric sites are not visible in apo-crystal structures, but they may be visible in holo-structures when a certain ligand binds and maintains the ligand intended conformation. Several computational and experimental techniques have been used to investigate these hidden sites but identifying them remains a challenge. Areas covered This review provides a summary of the many theoretical approaches for predicting hidden allosteric sites in disease-related proteins. Furthermore, promising cases have been thoroughly examined to reveal the hidden allosteric site and its modulator. Expert opinion In the recent past, with the development in scientific techniques and bioinformatics tools, the number of drug targets for complex human diseases has significantly increased but unfortunately most of these targets are undruggable due to several reasons. Alternative strategies such as finding cryptic (hidden) allosteric sites are an attractive approach for exploitation of the discovery of new targets. These hidden sites are difficult to recognize compared to allosteric sites, mainly due to a lack of visibility in the crystal structure. In our opinion, after many years of development, MD simulations are finally becoming successful for obtaining a detailed molecular description of drug-target interaction."
A Scaling Parameter for Predicting Pressure Wave Reflection in Stented Arteries,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL DEVICES-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME,A one dimensional finite difference model was developed to predict pressure wave reflections in stented arteries and a parametric study of variations in stent and vessel propertions was performed including stem stiffness length and compliance transition region as well as vessel radius and wall thickness The model war solved using a combination of weighted essentially nonoscillatory and Runge-Kutta methods Over 100 cases were tested and the magnitudes of the predicted waver were less than 0.5 mm Hg for all cases less than 1% of the normal pulse pressure of 40 mm Hg It was also shown that reason able variations in these parameters could induce changes in reflection magnitude of up to +/-50% The relationship between each of these properties and the resulting wave reflection could be described in a simple manner and the effect of all of them together could in fact be encompassed by a single nondimensional parameter titled stent authority It is believed that stent authority is a novel way of relating the energy imposed upon the arterial wall by the stem to the fraction of the incident pressure energy that is reflected front the stented region Based on these results it is believed that stent design can have a significant effect on pressure wave reflections however it was concluded that their small magnitudes make clinical relevance of these waver unlikely regardless of design [DOI 10.1115/1.3089140]
"Variations in chest compression time, ventilation time and rescuers' heart rate during conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation in trained male rescuers",CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL EMERGENCY MEDICINE,"Objective This study was conducted to determine why rescuers could maintain adequate chest compression depth for longer periods during conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Methods Various CPR parameters, including average compression depth (ACD), average compression rate, average ventilation time (AVT), and rescuers' heart rates were recorded in real-time when 20 health care providers performed 10 minutes of conventional CPR during a simulation experiment. Results The ACD was maintained above 50 mm and was not significantly different during 19 consecutive CPR cycles. The average compression rate increased from 114.9 +/- 10.0/min (2nd cycle) to 120.1 +/- 13.8/min (18th cycle) (P=0.007), and the AVT increased from 8.7 +/- 1.5 seconds (3rd cycle) to 10.1 +/- 2.6 seconds (18th cycle) (P=0.002). The rescuers' heart rates also increased gradually for 10 minutes; however, they increased rapidly and were highest during the ventilation phase. Their heart rates then decreased and were lowest during the early chest compression phases of each CPR cycle. Decreases in heart rates were significant in all CPR cycles (average decrease: 14.5 +/- 4.5 beats/min, P<0.001). Conclusion The ACD was maintained adequately during 10 minutes of conventional CPR. However, the AVT increased significantly during the 10-minute period. The rescuers' heart rates increased and decreased throughout all CPR cycles. These results showed that the ventilation phase might play a role as a resting period and be a reason for the maintenance of adequate chest compression depth for prolonged periods during conventional CPR."
Semiparametric additive rates model for recurrent events data with intermittent gaps,STATISTICS IN MEDICINE,"Statistical methods for analyzing recurrent events have attracted significant attention. The majority of existing works consider situations in which subjects are observed over time periods and events of interest that occurred during the course of follow-up are recorded. In some applications, a subject may leave the study for a period of time and then resume due to various reasons. During the absence, which is referred to as an intermittent gap in this study, it may be impossible to observe a recording of the event. A naive analysis disregards gaps and considers events to be a typical recurrent event dataset. However, this may result in biased estimations and misleading results. In this study, we build an additive rates model for recurrent event data considering intermittent gaps. We provide the asymptotic theories behind the proposed model, as well as the goodness of fit between observed and modeled values. Simulation studies reveal that the estimations perform well if intermittent gaps are taken into account. In addition, we utilized the longitudinal cohort of elderly patients who have type 2 diabetes and at least one record of a severe recurrent complication, hypoglycemia, from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan to demonstrate the proposed method."
JBASE: Joint Bayesian Analysis of Subphenotypes and Epistasis,BIOINFORMATICS,"Motivation: Rapid advances in genotyping and genome-wide association studies have enabled the discovery of many new genotype-phenotype associations at the resolution of individual markers. However, these associations explain only a small proportion of theoretically estimated heritability of most diseases. In this work, we propose an integrative mixture model called JBASE: joint Bayesian analysis of subphenotypes and epistasis. JBASE explores two major reasons of missing heritability: interactions between genetic variants, a phenomenon known as epistasis and phenotypic heterogeneity, addressed via subphenotyping. Results: Our extensive simulations in a wide range of scenarios repeatedly demonstrate that JBASE can identify true underlying subphenotypes, including their associated variants and their interactions, with high precision. In the presence of phenotypic heterogeneity, JBASE has higher Power and lower Type 1 Error than five state-of-the-art approaches. We applied our method to a sample of individuals from Mexico with Type 2 diabetes and discovered two novel epistatic modules, including two loci each, that define two subphenotypes characterized by differences in body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio. We successfully replicated these subphenotypes and epistatic modules in an independent dataset from Mexico genotyped with a different platform."
Modeling the hazard of transition into the absorbing state in the illness-death model,BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL,"The illness-death model is the simplest multistate model where the transition from the initial state 0 to the absorbing state 2 may involve an intermediate state 1 (e.g., disease relapse). The impact of the transition into state 1 on the subsequent transition hazard to state 2 enables insight to be gained into the disease evolution. The standard approach of analysis is modeling the transition hazards from 0 to 2 and from 1 to 2, including time to illness as a time-varying covariate and measuring time from origin even after transition into state 1. The hazard from 1 to 2 can be also modeled separately using only patients in state 1, measuring time from illness and including time to illness as a fixed covariate. A recently proposed approach is a model where time after the transition into state 1 is measured in both scales and time to illness is included as a time-varying covariate. Another possibility is a model where time after transition into state 1 is measured only from illness and time to illness is included as a fixed covariate. Through theoretical reasoning and simulation protocols, we discuss the use of these models and we develop a practical strategy aiming to (a) validate the properties of the illness-death process, (b) estimate the impact of time to illness on the hazard from state 1 to 2, and (c) quantify the impact that the transition into state 1 has on the hazard of the absorbing state. The strategy is also applied to a literature dataset on diabetes."
Why Is ABI Effective in Detecting Vascular Stenosis? Investigation Based on Multibranch Hemodynamic Model,SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL,"The ankle-brachial index (ABI), defined as the ratio of systolic pressure in the ankle arteries and that in the brachial artery, was a useful noninvasive method to detect arterial stenoses. There had been a lot of researches about clinical regularities of ABI; however, mechanism studies were less addressed. For the purpose of a better understanding of the correlation between vascular stenoses and ABI, a computational model for simulating blood pressure and flow propagation in various arterial stenosis circumstances was developed with a detailed compartmental description of the heart and main arteries. Particular attention was paid to the analysis of effects of vascular stenoses in different large-sized arteries on ABI in theory. Moreover, the variation of ABI during the increase of the stenosis severity was also studied. Results showed that stenoses in lower limb arteries, as well as, brachial artery, caused different variations of blood pressure in ankle and brachial arteries, resulting in a significant change of ABI. Furthermore, the variation of ABI became faster when the severity of the stenosis increased, validating that ABI was more sensitive to severe stenoses than to mild/moderate ones. All these in findings revealed the reason why ABI was an effective index for detecting stenoses, especially in lower limb arteries."
"5,6,7,9-Tetrahydro-[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-h]carbazol-8-one: A solvatochromic PET-acceptor fluorescent probe",JOURNAL OF LUMINESCENCE,"In the present work, 5,6,7,9-tetrahydro-[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-h]carbazol-8-one (TDCO) has been established as a solvatochromic probe and an acceptor of photoinduced electron transfer through electronic absorption spectroscopy, steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements and also by using the laser flash photolysis technique. Fluorescence spectra of the compound are more sensitive than its absorption spectra towards the nature of solvent and the composition of solvent mixture. In solvents with higher dielectric constant and better H-bond formation ability, fluorescence maximum of the compound shifts toward red. The reasons behind such solvent sensitivity of TDCO in electronic excited state are its higher dipole moment in excited state and formation of hydrogen bond with solvents. TDCO interacts with aromatic amine bases N,N-dimethylaniline (DMA) and N,N-diethylaniline (DEA) in excited state and as a consequence its fluorescence intensity and lifetime are quenched. The quenching order is the same as the order of ionization potential of the amines. Transient absorption studies indicate the involvement of photoinduced electron transfer from the amines to TDCO as a result of which the corresponding radical cations and anions have been formed. Simulation studies show that TDCO has the tendency to remain in stacked conformation with DMA and DEA, which facilitates photoinduced electron transfer. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
In vitro comparison of the load-bearing capacity of ceramic and metal-ceramic resin-bonded fixed dental prostheses in the posterior region,JOURNAL OF PROSTHETIC DENTISTRY,"Statement of problem. The clinical use of ceramic resin-bonded fixed dental prostheses (RBFDPs) in the posterior region is desirable for esthetic and biological reasons but has been associated with many technical problems, including fractures or chipping of the veneer. Although these problems may be overcome by using monolithic zirconia, information is lacking about the load-bearing capacity of resin-bonded monolithic zirconia restorations for replacing a molar. Purpose. The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the load-bearing capacity (Fe), the load at initial damage (F-1d), and the failure pattern of posterior RBFDPs fabricated from monolithic zirconia (MZr), veneered zirconia (VZr), and veneered cobalt-chromium (VCo). Material and methods. For the replacement of a maxillary first molar, 4 groups (n=8) of RBFDPs differing in prosthesis material and retainer design (MZr-IR-RBFDPs, VZr-IR-RBFDPs, MZr-WR-RBFDPs, and VCo-WR-RBFDPs; IR, inlay-retained; WR, adhesive wing-retained) were fabricated with anatomic congruence of the FDP-abutment complex. The RBFDPs were subjected to thermocycling (10 000x6.5 degrees C/60 degrees C) and mastication simulation (30-degree oblique loading on the pontic; 1 200 000x108 N) and then loaded until failure in a universal testing machine (0.5 mm/minute). Test forces correlating with F-u and F-1d were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed by using 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), 2-way. repeated measures ANOVA, and the Tukey honest significant differences post hoc test (2-sided alpha=.05). Results. F-u was significantly affected by retainer design (P<.001) and F-1d by both retainer design (P<.001) and prosthesis material (P<.001). F-u was more than 2000 N for WR-RBFDPs and more than 1000 N for IR-RBFDPs (Tukey test ranking: MZr-WR-RBFDPs = VCo-WR-RBFDPs > MZr-IR-RBFDPs = VZr-IR-RBFDPs). Ceramic RBFDPs failed by complete fracture in the connector region, whereas failure of VCo-WR-RBFDPs was limited to the ceramic veneer. F-1d was significantly lower (P <=.004) than F-u for veneered specimens only; F-1d started at test forces below 500 N and coincided with veneer cracking. Conclusions. Load-bearing capacity suitable for the definitive restoration of a molar was observed for all groups. Veneered resin-bonded fixed dental prostheses, however, were susceptible to cracking of the veneer."
Current and potential use of fresh frozen cadaver in surgical training and anatomical education,ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION,"As surgical procedures continue to be more complex, the need for more effective training in anatomy has increased. The study of anatomy plays a significant role in the understanding of the human body as well as in basic and advanced clinical training. Among the different cadaver models, fresh frozen cadavers (FFCs) are known for their realistic tissue quality. The purpose of this article was to review and summarize the preparation procedures for and reported cases involving FFCs. PubMed, Scopus, Medline, and Web of Science were searched for relevant studies. The preparation procedures were divided into five steps: washing, irrigation, freezing, defrosting, and arterial infusion. Not all steps were reported to be mandatory, but omitting one or more could result in a loss of quality. FFCs were reported to be used for various purposes: undergraduate education, general surgery training, vascular surgery training, minimal access surgery (laparoscopic surgery) training, and microsurgery training. In all categories, expert opinions and statistical analyses indicated successful outcomes. The reasons for high satisfaction with FFCs included realistic texture, capability of reenacting actual operations, and accuracy of anatomical locations. The results also revealed the importance and advantages of the dissection courses in surgical training. Since the direct comparison between cadaver models is insufficient, future studies regarding this topic are deemed necessary. In addition, it would be advantageous to develop methods to improve FFC quality, or ideas to optimize this model for certain purposes."
Joint models for toxicology studies with dose-dependent number of implantations,RISK ANALYSIS,"Many chemicals interfere with the natural reproductive processes in mammals. The chemicals may prevent the fertilization of an egg or keep a zygote from implanting in the uterine wan. For this reason, toxicology studies with pre-implantation exposure often exhibit a dose-related trend in the number of observed implantations per litter. Standard methods for analyzing developmental toxicology studies are conditioned on the number of implantations in the litter and therefore cannot estimate this effect of the chemical on the reproductive process. This article presents a joint modeling approach to estimating risk in toxicology studies with preimplantation exposure. In the joint modeling approach, both the number of implanted fetuses and the outcome of each implanted fetus is modeled. Using this approach we show how to estimate the overall risk of a chemical that incorporates the risk of lost implantation due to pre-implantation expos ire. Our approach has several distinct advantages over previous methods: (1) it is based or fitting a model for the observed data and, therefore, diagnostics of model fit and selection apply; (2) all assumptions are explicitly stated; and (3) it can be fit using standard software packages. We illustrate our approach by analyzing a dominant lethal assay data set (Luning et al., 1966, Mutation Research, 3, 444-451) and compare our results with those of Rai and Van Ryzin (1985, Biometrics, 41,1-9) and Dunson (1998, Biometrics 54, 558-569). In a simulation study, our approach has smaller bias and variance than the multiple imputation procedure of Dunson."
On Genome-Wide Association Studies and Their Meta-Analyses: Lessons Learned From Osteoporosis Studies,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM,"Context: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and meta-analyses of GWASs have led to the identification of a number of promising genes for osteoporosis. However, inconsistent findings are seen among and between GWASs and meta-analyses, and inconsistencies have even been observed between meta-analyses whose samples overlapped to a large extent. Objectives: We carefully evaluated the usefulness and limitations of GWASs and their meta-analyses, with an emphasis on understanding the reasons for inconsistent results. Design: Based on published empirical data for osteoporosis, we performed a series of theoretical analyses using simulation studies. Results: The power of meta-analyses is limited to identifying a particular locus with modest effect size. In the situation in which individual GWASs were not included in the meta-analysis (ie, non-overlap), the meta-analysis has rather limited power to replicate particular loci identified from the individual GWASs. Between-study heterogeneity may result in a power loss in meta-analyses, implying that adding heterogeneous samples into a meta-analysis may reduce the power, rather than having the anticipated effect of increasing power due to increased sample size. Conclusions: Discordant findings in GWASs and meta-analyses are not unexpected, even for true susceptible genes. Contrary to the general belief, meta-analyses should not and cannot be used as a gold standard to evaluate the results of individual GWASs. Individual GWASs in homogeneous populations can detect true disease genes that meta-analyses may have low power to replicate."
Quantification of Bias in Direct Effects Estimates Due to Different Types of Measurement Error in the Mediator,EPIDEMIOLOGY,"Assessing whether the effect of exposure on an outcome is completely mediated by a third variable is often done by conditioning on the intermediate variable. However, when an association remains, it is not always clear how this should be interpreted. It may be explained by a causal direct effect of the exposure on the disease, or the adjustment may have been distorted due to various reasons, such as error in the measured mediator or unknown confounding of association between the mediator and the outcome. In this paper, we study various situations where the conditional relationship between the exposure and the outcome is biased due to different types of measurement error in the mediator. For each of these situations, we quantify the effect on the association parameter. Such formulas can be used as tools for sensitivity analysis or to correct the association parameter for the bias due to measurement error. The performance of the bias formulas is studied by simulation and by applying them to data from a case-control study (Leiden Thrombophilia Study) on risk factors for venous thrombosis. In this study, the question was the extent to which the relationship between blood group and venous thrombosis might be mediated through coagulation factor VIII. We found that measurement error could have strongly biased the estimated direct effect of blood group on thrombosis. The formulas we propose can be a guide for researchers who find a residual association after adjusting for an intermediate variable and who wish to explore other possible explanations before concluding that there is a direct causal effect."
Reduction in segmental flexibility because of disc degeneration is accompanied by higher changes in facet loads than changes in disc pressure: a poroelastic C5-C6 finite element investigation,SPINE JOURNAL,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Nerve fiber growth inside the degenerative intervertebral discs and facets is thought to be a source of pain, although there may be several other pathological and clinical reasons for the neck pain. It, however, remains difficult to decipher how much disc and facet joints contribute to overall degenerative segmental responses. Although the biomechanical effects of disc degeneration (DD) on segmental flexibility and posterior facets have been reported in the lumbar spine, a clear understanding of the pathways of degenerative progression is still lacking in the cervical spine. PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that after an occurrence of degenerative disease in a cervical disc, changes in the facet loads will be higher than changes in the disc pressure. STUDY DESIGN: To understand the biomechanical relationships between segmental flexibility, disc pressure, and facet loads when the C5-C6 disc degenerates. METHODS: A poroelastic, three-dimensional finite element (FE) model of a normal C5-C6 segment was developed and validated. Two degenerated disc models (moderate and severe) were built from the normal disc model. Biomechanical responses of the three FE models (normal, moderate, and severe) were further studied under diurnal compression (at the end of the daytime activity period) and moment loads (at the end of 5 seconds) in terms of disc height loss, angular motions, disc pressure, and facet loads (average of right and left facets). RESULTS: Disc deformation under compression and segmental rotational motions under moment loads for the normal disc model agreed well with the corresponding in vivo studies. A decrease in segmental flexibility because of DD is accompanied by a decrease in disc pressure and an increase in facet loads. Biomechanical effects of degenerative disc changes are least in flexion. Segmental flexibility changes are higher in extension, whereas changes in disc pressure and facet loads are higher in lateral bending and axial rotation, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study confirmed the hypothesis of higher changes in facet loads than in disc pressure, suggesting posterior facets are more affected than discs because of a decrease in degenerative segmental flexibility. Therefore, a degenerated disc may increase the risk of overloading the posterior facet joints. It should be clearly noted that only after degeneration simulation in the disc, we recorded the biomechanical responses of the facets and disc. Therefore, our hypothesis does not suggest that facet joint osteoarthritis may occur before degeneration in the disc. Future cervical spine based experiments are warranted to verify the conclusions presented in this study. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Predicting meniscal tear stability across knee-joint flexion using finite-element analysis,KNEE SURGERY SPORTS TRAUMATOLOGY ARTHROSCOPY,"PurposeTo analyse the stress distribution through longitudinal and radial meniscal tears in three tear locations in weight-bearing conditions and use it to ascertain the impact of tear location and type on the potential for healing of meniscal tears.MethodsSubject-specific finite-element models of a healthy knee under static loading at 0 degrees, 20 degrees, and 30 degrees knee flexion were developed from unloaded magnetic resonance images and weight-bearing, contrast-enhanced computed tomography images. Simulations were then run after introducing tears into the anterior, posterior, and midsections of the menisci.ResultsAbsolute differences between the displacements of anterior and posterior segments modelled in the intact state and those quantified from in vivo weight-bearing images were less than 0.5mm. There were tear-location-dependent differences between hoop stress distributions along the inner and outer surfaces of longitudinal tears; the longitudinal tear surfaces were compressed together to the greatest degree in the lateral meniscus and were most consistently in compression on the midsections of both menisci. Radial tears resulted in an increase in stress at the tear apex and in a consistent small compression of the tear surfaces throughout the flexion range when in the posterior segment of the lateral meniscus.ConclusionsBoth the type of meniscal tear and its location within the meniscus influenced the stresses on the tear surfaces under weight bearing. Results agree with clinical observations and suggest reasons for the inverse correlation between longitudinal tear length and healing, the inferior healing ability of medial compared with lateral menisci, and the superior healing ability of radial tears in the posterior segment of the lateral meniscus compared with other radial tears. This study has shown that meniscal tear location in addition to type likely plays a crucial role in dictating the success of non-operative treatment of the menisci. This may be used in decision making regarding conservative or surgical management."
ANTIBACTERIAL EFFECT OF GRAPHENE AND GRAPHENE OXIDE AS A POTENTIAL MATERIAL FOR FIBER FINISHES,AUTEX RESEARCH JOURNAL,"The dynamic development of the world economy entails an increasing exchange of goods and population. This means that we are globally struggling with increasing levels of nosocomial infections. The increasing use of antimicrobial agents triggers the microorganisms' immune system, which in turn contributes to the increasing amount of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, making it necessary to control the development of unwanted microorganisms, including bacteria, especially those carried on the body and clothing. Currently, there is no unique method to combat the multiplication of microorganisms and eliminate threats to human health and life. For this reason, this article describes the possibilities of using graphene materials as a potential additive materials in fiber finishes as an antibacterial aspect in various areas of life. However, the literature does not explain the mechanisms behind the antibacterial properties of graphene, strongly limiting its textile application. The research is conducted using molecular dynamic simulations of interaction between graphene materials and murein. The obtained results suggest the electrostatic mechanism of blocking the growth and division of bacteria. Due to the physical interaction, bacterial cell becomes trapped without changing its growth parameters. This may lead to an increase of internal cell pressure, rupture of its wall and consequently its death."
Enhanced heme accessibility in horse heart mini-myoglobin: Insights from molecular modelling and reactivity studies,ARCHIVES OF BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS,"Mini-myoglobin (mini-HHMb) is a fragment of horse-heart myoglobin (HHMb) considered to be the prototype of the product encoded by the central exon of the HHMb gene. For this reason, mini-HHMb has been studied extensively showing that carbonylation and oxygenation properties of the ferrous form are similar to those of the full-length protein, while kinetics and thermodynamics of azide binding to the ferric form are significantly different from those of HHMb. To analyze the structure function relationships in mini-HHMb and the role of conformational fluctuations in ligand accessibility, the molecular model of mini-HHMb has been built and refined by molecular dynamics simulations, and analyzed in parallel with that of full length HHMb. Moreover, imidazole binding parameters of ferric mini-HHMb and HHMb have been determined. Furthermore, structural data of ferric mini-HHMb and HHMb have been correlated with the imidazole and previously determined azide binding properties. Present results indicate that, despite the extensive trimming, the heme-alpha-helices E-F substructure is essentially unaltered in mini-HHMb with respect to HHMb. However, the heme-Fe atom displays an enhanced accessibility in mini-HHMb, which may affect both ligand association and dissociation kinetics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Challenges of training in adrenal surgery,GLAND SURGERY,"While adrenal tumors are common, adrenalectomy is rather uncommon. This is one reason for the many challenges regarding the training of adrenal surgery. Here we focus on issues that are most pertinent regarding training of the young surgeons performing adrenalectomy. Due to the very limited literature, what is presented is mainly based on personal experience and/or from the literature published for other surgical operations and subspecialties. The discussed challenges include indications for surgery, surgical approaches and extent, and intraoperative complications. With advances in adrenal surgery, we expect some old challenges to be resolved, and some new challenges to arise. These challenges will be faced in order to continue to help our younger trainee acquire the knowledge and skills to best care for our patients with adrenal diseases."
Electromagnetic interference and quality of life in device workers,CLINICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE: A HANDBOOK FOR OCCUPATIONAL PHYSICIANS,"EMI in device workers. Some electromagnetic factors are capable of inducing considerable voltage to the electrodes, which may interfere with the functioning of cardiac devices (electromagnetic interference: EMI). It is important to know what sources of EMI are of potential concern and how EMI affects cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). Modern cardiac devices designs have increased protection from EMI by effective shielding of the device circuitry, filtering of the incoming signal, and the increasing use of bipolar leads to reduce the problem even further. However, new technologies in the environment that use more of the electromagnetic spectrum may give reason for additional concern in assessing EMI risks for patients with implanted cardiac devices. In most cases the pacemaker responses to EMI are inappropriate pacing inhibition, inappropriate triggering of rapid or premature pacing, reversion mode to asynchronous pacing, and spurious tachyarrhythmia detection in ICDs. Reprogramming of operating parameters, closure of the reed switch and permanent damage to the generator and the lead electrode-to-tissue interface are much less frequent, After cardiac device implantation, patients returning to work in an environment suspected of high level EMI can face challenges. Among the many potential EMI sources, are or spot welders, industrial welding machines, degaussing coils, and electric motors are frequent causes of concern. Therefore, patients in specialized industrial environments should be assessed individually. The potential for EMI should never be taken lightly, and appropriate screening and monitoring should be applied to avoid adverse clinical outcomes. In addition, prospective studies must be performed using a simulation model to detect EMI and calculate protection distances. Newer technologies must be assessed for potential EMI effects on cardiac pacemakers and ICDs. QOL in device workers. Cardiac device therapies are established treatments for patients with arrhythmias. The primary goal of cardiac device therapy is to improve how patients feel and function during daily life. Quality of life (QOL) is a supplementary approach to evaluate effectiveness of treatment. Standard clinical practice permits the use of either single-chamber ventricular pacemakers or dual-chamber pacemakers for most patients who require cardiac pacing. Pacing mode may be one of the factors that effect QOL. However, we did not observe a benefit of physiological pacing over ventricular pacing. ICD therapy clearly reduces the incidence of death from recurrent life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). The occurrence of ICD shocks is associated with increased psychological distress in both patients and their families. An increase in depression and anxiety are associated with more frequent ICD shocks. In addition, the development of frequent ICD shocks is also associated with an increased risk of death so that the hybrid therapies such as anti-arrhythmic drugs and ablation are necessary to reduce the frequency of recurrent VT and VF. Therefore, reducing ICD shock frequency may lead to an improvement in QOL as well. Reemployment is an important aspect of QOL measurements. Returning to work post-ICD implantation has correlated with increased sexual interest and frequency, increased energy and interest in daily activities, and more attendance at social functions. Cultural and socioeconomic factors (including the availability of social welfare support) can influence a patient's decision to return to work. While post-ICD implantation patients are more protected from fatal arrhythmia than prior to the implantation, post-implantation health concerns are paradoxically increased and QOL is decreased. Adverse psychological responses to the ICD should be considered in the risk/benefit assessment in prescribing ICD therapy."
Sexual and Contraceptive Behaviors among Adolescents Requesting Emergency Contraception,JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC AND ADOLESCENT GYNECOLOGY,"Study Objective and Design: Unintended pregnancy rates in the United States remain high among adolescents. Emergency contraception (EC) provides the only option for pregnancy prevention after unprotected sex. To better define the population of adolescents who request and use EC pills, we performed a post hoc analysis of an over-the-counter simulation study of EC pills. Setting: Teen reproductive health clinics in 5 cities. Participants: Adolescents between the ages of 13 and 17 years who requested EC. Interventions: Single-tablet levonorgestrel 1.5 mg. Main Outcome Measures: We calculated the correlations between age and baseline sexual and contraceptive behaviors. x(2) Tests were used to compare behaviors of first-time and repeat EC users. Results: Overall, the most commonly reported contraceptive methods ever used were condoms, oral contraceptives, none, and withdrawal; the most common method ever used in each age group was no method for 13- to 14-year-olds and condom for 15-, 16-, and 17-year-olds. The percentage of participants who had never used contraception before requesting EC decreased with age (53% [20/28] of 13- to 14-yearolds vs 15% [10/65] of 17-year-olds). First-time EC users were more likely to report no previous contraceptive use compared with repeat EC users (42% [88/208] vs 10% [13/135]; P <.001). Regardless of age, the most commonly reported reason for requesting EC was nonuse of any contraceptive method (ie, unprotected sex). Conclusion: Adolescents who requested EC most commonly reported ever-use of contraceptive methods that rely on user adherence or no method at all, with younger adolescents more likely than older adolescents to have used no previous method. The provision of EC presents an opportunity to provide education and access to highly effective, long-term contraceptive methods."
The impact of functional connectivity changes on support vector machines mapping of fMRI data,JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is currently one of the most widely used methods for studying human brain function in vivo. Although many different approaches to fMRI analysis are available, the most widely used methods employ so called mass-univariate modeling of responses in a voxel-by-voxel fashion to construct activation maps. However, it is well known that many brain processes involve networks of interacting regions and for this reason multivariate analyses might seem to be attractive alternatives to univariate approaches. The current paper focuses on one multivariate application of statistical learning theory: the statistical discrimination maps (SDM) based on support vector machine, and seeks to establish some possible interpretations when the results differ from univariate 'approaches. In fact, when there are changes not only on the activation level of two conditions but also on functional connectivity, SDM seems more informative. We addressed this question using both simulations and applications to real data. We have shown that the combined use of univariate approaches and SDM yields significant new insights into brain activations not available using univariate methods alone. In the application to a visual working memory fMRI data, we demonstrated that the interaction among brain regions play a role in SDM's power to detect discriminative voxels. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

"Nicotine Population Pharmacokinetics in Healthy Smokers After Intravenous, Oral, Buccal and Transdermal Administration",CLINICAL PHARMACOKINETICS,"Background In 4 decades, numerous nicotine replacement therapy products have been developed. Population pharmacokinetic models can support exposure-response modeling and inform nicotine replacement therapy product development, but only limited model-based cross-study population pharmacokinetic analyses for nicotine replacement therapy products have been published. Objectives The aim of this retrospective analysis was to assess the population pharmacokinetics of nicotine across intravenous, oral, transdermal and oromucosal (mouth spray, chewing gum, lozenge and inhaler) routes and formulations in healthy smoking subjects. Methods Data on 930 unique subjects (46,016 observations) from 29 single- and repeated-dose studies with multiple formulations across intravenous, oral, transdermal and oromucosal routes of administration were included. Data from intravenous and extravascular routes of administration were modelled separately for run efficiency reasons. For developing extravascular models, clearance and disposition parameters and their inter-individual variabilities were fixed to the estimates for intravenously delivered nicotine. Detectable pre-dose nicotine concentrations were modelled as a hypothetical nicotine bolus into the central compartment at the start of wash-out. Modelling repeated-dose oral and buccal administrations required a time-dependent increase in clearance or decrease in bioavailability to describe the data adequately. Results Disposition of intravenous nicotine was best described by a three-compartment model with initial and terminal half-lives of 7 min and 4.5 h, respectively, and the absorption of single oral doses was best described with a first-order absorption rate constant of 1.55 h(-1). The data of buccal formulations were modelled with parallel oromucosal absorption and gastrointestinal absorption of a part of the dose that is swallowed. For transdermal nicotine, parallel zero- and first-order release from the patch and a transit-compartment absorption model best described the data. Key pharmacokinetic parameters were reliably estimated, with typical values for clearance (67 L/h for a 70-kg subject), volume of distribution (4.3 L/kg), oral bioavailability (40%) and transdermal bioavailability (76%) within expected ranges. The estimated fraction of the dose swallowed for buccal formulations ranged from 55% (gum) to 69% (lozenge). Conclusions Robust population pharmacokinetic models were developed for five nicotine replacement therapy product types and for intravenous and oral nicotine. These population pharmacokinetic models are used in exposure-response analyses and simulation-based nicotine replacement therapy product design."
Statistical control of processes applied to geometric uncertainties for CTV expansion margins determination in prostate cancer patients treated with VMAT: a prospective study in 57 patients,CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY,"Purpose To study the control graphs applicability for the geometric uncertainties of VMAT treatments in prostate cancer patients, and their use to verify the hypothesis of the data obtained randomness, to apply the margins of Van Herk expression. Material and methods During the first 5 days of treatment, and then once a week, a Kv CBCT was performed, compared with the simulation CT and adjusted the displacements, to determine the inter-fraction errors. Immediately after radiation therapy, another CBCT was performed (for intra-fraction errors). With these data, theX,Rposition control charts have been made. The patients, not maintained the deviations within the charts control limits, were called anomalies. Then, we compared the deviations and margins calculated with the van Herk expression for all patients and for those without anomalies. Results The margins determined show appreciable differences if there were calculated for the total set of patients or for the set of them without anomalies in the control charts. For the overall set of patients, the lateral, longitudinal, and vertical margins were 0.45 cm, 0.52 cm, 0.56 cm, while for the set of patients without anomalies were 0.29 cm, 0.35 cm, and 0.38 cm. Conclusions The use of control charts allows tracking geometric deviations both inter and intra-fraction, variability real-time control and to detect situations in which it can change for non-random reasons, and require immediate investigation. Maintaining geometric deviations in the control state decreases the margins needed to administer a high dose to CTV in a high percentage of cancer prostate patients."
Pd-103 strings: Monte Carlo assessment of a new approach to brachytherapy source design,MEDICAL PHYSICS,"Purpose: A new type of Pd-103 source (CivaString and CivaThin by CivaTech Oncology, Inc.) is examined. The source contains Pd-103 and Au radio-opaque marker(s), all contained within low-Z(eff) organic polymers that permit source flexibility. The CivaString source is available in lengths L of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 mm, and referred to in the current study as CS10-CS60, respectively. A thinner design, CivaThin, has sources designated as CT10-CT60, respectively. The CivaString and CivaThin sources are 0.85 and 0.60 mm in diameter, respectively. The source design is novel and offers an opportunity to examine its interesting dosimetric properties in comparison to conventional Pd-103 seeds. Methods: The MCNP5 radiation transport code was used to estimate air-kerma rate and dose rate distributions with polar and cylindrical coordinate systems. Doses in water and prostate tissue phantoms were compared to determine differences between the TG-43 formalism and realistic clinical circumstances. The influence of Ti encapsulation and 2.7 keV photons was examined. The accuracy of superposition of dose distributions from shorter sources to create longer source dose distributions was also assessed. Results: The normalized air-kerma rate was not highly dependent on L or the polar angle., with results being nearly identical between the CivaString and CivaThin sources for common L. The air-kerma strength was also weakly dependent on L. The uncertainty analysis established a standard uncertainty of 1.3% for the dose-rate constant L, where the largest contributors were mu(en)/rho. and mu/rho. The Lambda values decreased with increasing L, which was largely explained by differences in solid angle. The radial dose function did not substantially vary among the CivaString and CivaThin sources for r >= 1 cm. However, behavior for r < 1 cm indicated that the Au marker(s) shielded radiation for the sources having L = 10, 30, and 50 mm. The 2D anisotropy function exhibited peaks and valleys that corresponded to positions adjacent to Pd-103 wells and Au markers, respectively. Dose distributions of both source types had minimal anisotropy in comparison to conventional Pd-103 seeds. Contributions by 2.7 keV photons comprised = 0.1% of the dose from all photons at positions farther than 0.13 mm from the polymer source surface. Differences between absorbed dose to water and prostate became more substantial as distance from the sources increased, with prostate dose being about 13% lower for r = 5 cm. Using a cylindrical coordinate system, dose superposition of small length sources to replicate the dose distribution for a long length source proved to be a robust technique; a 2.0% tolerance compared with the reference dose distribution did not exceed 0.1 cm(3) for any of the examined source combinations. Conclusions: By design, the CivaString and CivaThin sources have novel dosimetric characteristics in comparison to Ti-encapsulated Pd-103 seeds. The dosimetric characterization has determined the reasons for these differences through analysis using Monte Carlo-based radiation transport simulations.

"De Novo Mutations in SLC25A24 Cause a Disorder Characterized by Early Aging, Bone Dysplasia, Characteristic Face, and Early Demise",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS,"A series of simplex cases have been reported under various diagnoses sharing early aging, especially evident in congenitally decreased subcutaneous fat tissue and sparse hair, bone dysplasia of the skull and fingers, a distinctive facial gestalt, and prenatal and postnatal growth retardation. For historical reasons, we suggest naming the entity Fontaine syndrome. Exome sequencing of four unrelated affected individuals showed that all carried the de novo missense variant c. 649C>T (p.Arg217Cys) or c.650G>A (p.Arg217His) in SLC25A24, a solute carrier 25 family member coding for calcium-binding mitochondrial carrier protein (SCaMC-1, also known as SLC25A24). SLC25A24 allows an electro-neutral and reversible exchange of ATP-Mg and phosphate between the cytosol and mitochondria, which is required for maintaining optimal adenine nucleotide levels in the mitochondrial matrix. Molecular dynamic simulation studies predict that p.Arg217Cys and p.Arg217His narrow the substrate cavity of the protein and disrupt transporter dynamics. SLC25A24-mutant fibroblasts and cells expressing p.Arg217Cys or p.Arg217His variants showed altered mitochondrial morphology, a decreased proliferation rate, increased mitochondrial membrane potential, and decreased ATP-linked mitochondrial oxygen consumption. The results suggest that the SLC25A24 mutations lead to impaired mitochondrial ATP synthesis and cause hyperpolarization and increased proton leak in association with an impaired energy metabolism. Our findings identify SLC25A24 mutations affecting codon 217 as the underlying genetic cause of human progeroid Fontaine syndrome."
Tamoxifen treatment failure in cancer and the nonlinear dynamics of TGF beta,JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY,"The process of cancer invasion involves a complex interplay between cell-cell and cell-medium adhesion, proteolytic enzyme secretion, cell birth and death processes, random and directed motility, and immune response, as well as many other factors. The growth factor TGFbeta is known to have a complex effect on this process. It inhibits mitosis and promotes apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro, and it is for this reason that its secretion is thought to be helpful in inhibiting tumour growth. However, recent in vitro and in vivo results have shown a significant effect of this growth factor in promoting the sensitivity of malignantly transformed cells to gradients of extracellular matrix proteins-an effect which tends to increase invasiveness. The drug tamoxifen has been demonstrated to be therapeutically effective in the treatment of patients with breast cancer; however, it is known also that many patients become resistant to the effect of this drug after a few years, and the reasons for this remain controversial. In this work we take our established model of cancer invasion (J. Theor. Biol. 216(l) (2002) 85), and extend it to include the effect of TGFbeta. In so doing we demonstrate that a tamoxifen-stimulated upregulation of the secretion of TGFbeta may give rise to a tumour which has a smaller number of cells but which has a greater invasiveness, greater metastatic potential, and a tumour histology which is known to correlate with a poorer prognosis. These data suggest that tamoxifen-stimulated secretion of TGFbeta might explain treatment failure in some patients. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
Finite element analysis of stress in the equine proximal phalanx,EQUINE VETERINARY JOURNAL,"Reasons for performing study To improve understanding of the internal structure of the proximal phalanx (P1), response of the bone to load and possible relation to the pathogenesis of fractures in P1. Objectives To model the P1 and replicate the loads experienced by the bone in stance, walk, trot and gallop using finite element analysis. Methods The geometry of the P1 was captured using micro-computed tomography (CT) and was reconstructed in 3 dimensions. Values for material properties and forces experienced at stance, walk, trot and gallop were taken from the literature and were applied to the reconstructed model. Using the same total load across the proximal articular surface, the model was solved with and without loading of the sagittal groove. Biomechanical performance was then simulated with finite element analysis and evaluated in terms of von Mises stress maps. Results Compared with the lowest force simulation equivalent to stance, the effects of the gallop force showed higher levels of stress along the sagittal groove and on the palmar surface just distal to the sagittal groove in both models, with and without the sagittal groove loaded. The results highlighted an area of bone on the dorsal aspect of P1 that experiences lower stress compared with the rest of the dorsal surface, an effect that was much more apparent when the sagittal groove was not loaded. Qualitative comparison of the models revealed minimal difference in the pattern of von Mises stress between the loaded and unloaded groove models. Conclusions The study demonstrates a finite element model of P1 that produces results consistent with clinical observation. The simulated high stress levels associated with the sagittal groove correspond to the most common site for fractures in the equine P1. Potential relevance With refinement of the model and further investigation, it may be possible to improve understanding of the behaviour of P1 under loading conditions that more closely simulate those experienced in the living animal, leading to a more solid understanding of fractures of P1."
Structural basis for DNA recognition by STAT6,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,"STAT6 participates in classical IL-4/IL-13 signaling and stimulator of interferon genes-mediated antiviral innate immune responses. Aberrations in STAT6-mediated signaling are linked to development of asthma and diseases of the immune system. In addition, STAT6 remains constitutively active in multiple types of cancer. Therefore, targeting STAT6 is an attractive proposition for treating related diseases. Although a lot is known about the role of STAT6 in transcriptional regulation, molecular details on how STAT6 recognizes and binds specific segments of DNA to exert its function are not clearly understood. Here, we report the crystal structures of a homodimer of phosphorylated STAT6 core fragment (STAT6(CF)) alone and bound with the N3 and N4 DNA binding site. Analysis of the structures reveals that STAT6 undergoes a dramatic conformational change on DNA binding, which was further validated by performing molecular dynamics simulation studies and small angle X-ray scattering analysis. Our data show that a larger angle at the intersection where the two protomers of STAT meet and the presence of a unique residue, H415, in the DNA-binding domain play important roles in discrimination of the N4 site DNA from the N3 site by STAT6. H415N mutation of STAT6CF decreased affinity of the protein for the N4 site DNA, but increased its affinity for N3 site DNA, both in vitro and in vivo. Results of our structure-function studies on STAT6 shed light on mechanism of DNA recognition by STATs in general and explain the reasons underlying STAT6's preference for N4 site DNA over N3."
Importance of CBCT setup verification for optical-guided frameless radiosurgery,JOURNAL OF APPLIED CLINICAL MEDICAL PHYSICS,"The purpose of this study is to quantify the discrepancy between optical guidance platform (OGP) frameless localization system (Varian) and Trilogy on-board imaging (OBI) system (Varian) for setting up phantom and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) patient; and to determine whether cone-beam CT (CBCT) is necessary for OGP patient setup, and compare CBCT and orthogonal kV-kV in term of their verification capability. Three different phantoms were used in the study: a custom-made phantom, a Penta-Guide phantom, and a RANDO phantom. Five patients using both OGP and CBCT setup and 14 patients using CBCT setup alone were analyzed. One patient who had big couch shifts discrepancy between OGP and CBCT was selected for further investigation. Same patient's CBCT and planning CT were fused. A RANDO phantom simulation experiment was performed using OGP setup with both CBCT and orthogonal kV-kV verification. For all of three phantom experiments, the shifts performed by CBCT beam and orthogonal kV-kV were all within 1 mm. Among five SRS patients using OGP setup, three had 3D couch corrections more than 3 mm. The image fusion of CBCT and planning CT clearly illustrated a tilt of bite-block in a patient's mouth. For 14 SRS patients using CBCT-guided setup, overall 3D correction was 3.3 +/- 1.5 mm. RANDO phantom experiment demonstrated how a tilted bite-block caused isocenter shift. CBCT-calculated shifts are the same as expected, but kV-kV results differed by 1-2 mm if the initial head position is tilted. The bite-block tilting in patient's mouth is a major reason for the cause of positioning error for OGP frameless SRS setup. CBCT verification is necessary. CBCT provides more accurate couch corrections than orthogonal kV-kV when head was tilted. OGP is useful for detecting patient movement, but it does not necessarily imply that the isocenter has moved."
Theoretical explanation of the relationship between backscattered electron and X-ray linear attenuation coefficients in calcified tissues,SCANNING,"X-ray absorption and backscattered electron (BSE) microscopies are two commonly used techniques for estimating mineral contents in calcified tissues. The resolution in BSE images is usually higher than in x-ray images, but due to the previous lack of good standards to quantify the grey levels in BSE images of bones and teeth, x-ray microtomography (XMT) images of the same specimens have been used for calibration. However, the physics of these two techniques is different: for a specimen with a given composition, the xray linear attenuation coefficient is proportional to density, but there is no such relation with the BSE coefficient. To understand the reason that this calibration appears to be valid, the behaviour of simulated bone samples was investigated. In this, the bone samples were modelled as having three phases: hydroxyapatite (Ca-10(PO4)(6)(OH)(2)), protein, and void (either empty or completely filled with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), a resin which is usually used for embedding bones and teeth in microscopic studies). The x-ray linear attenuation coefficients (calculated using published data) and the BSE coefficients (calculated using Monte Carlo simulation) were compared for samples of various phase proportions. It was found that the BSE coefficient correlated only with the x-ray attenuation coefficient for samples with PMMA infiltration. This was attributed to the properties of PMMA (density and mean atomic number) being very similar to those of the protein; therefore, the sample behaves like a two-phase system which allows the establishment of a monotonic relation between density and BSE coefficient. With the newly developed standards (brominated and iodinated dimethacrylate esters) for BSE microscopy of bone, grey levels can be converted to absolute BSE coefficients by linear interpolation, from which equivalent densities can be determined."
How to Create an Arthroscopy Training Laboratory Using a Bovine Knee Model,ARTHROSCOPY TECHNIQUES,"Orthopaedic surgeries by video arthroscopy have become increasingly popular, as they allow joint treatment through small incisions and minimal tissue damage. However, their execution requires specific skills from the surgeon, different from open surgery, which can only be achieved through practical training. These skills would be ideally performed on human cadaveric anatomical pieces which, however, can be difficult to access for different reasons. Animal anatomical models for surgical skills training have been used for years in medicine, and we observed that the bovine knee has anatomical characteristics quite similar to that of the human knee. In this study, we explain, step by step, the installation and creation of an arthroscopy laboratory with a bovine model, in an effort to contribute to several training centers in arthroscopic surgery around the world, assisting and guiding such centers to install arthroscopy laboratories and facilitating the improvement of more surgeons."
DNA commission of the International Society of Forensic Genetics: Recommendations on the interpretation of mixtures,FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL,"The DNA commission of the International Society of Forensic Genetics (ISFG) was convened at the 21st congress of the International Society for Forensic Genetics held between 13 and 17 September in the Azores, Portugal. The purpose of the group was to agree on guidelines to encourage best practice that can be universally applied to assist with mixture interpretation. In addition the commission was tasked to provide guidance on low copy number (LCN) reporting. Our discussions have highlighted a significant need for continuing education and research into this area. We have attempted to present a consensus from experts but to be practical we do not claim to have conveyed a clear vision in every respect in this difficult subject. For this reason, we propose to allow a period of time for feedback and reflection by the scientific community. Then the DNA commission will meet again to consider further recommendations.

Impact of Parameters of Radiofrequency Coagulation on Volume of Stereotactic Lesion in Pallidotomy and Thalamotomy,STEREOTACTIC AND FUNCTIONAL NEUROSURGERY,"Background: One of the many reasons why lesional surgery for movement disorders has been more or less abandoned may have been the difficulty in predicting the shape and size of the stereotactic radiofrequency (RF) lesion. Objectives: To analyse the contribution of various RF coagulation parameters towards the volume of pallidotomies and thalamotomies. Methods: The relationship between temperature of coagulation, length of coagulated area and duration of coagulation on the one hand, and lesion volume on the other was retrospectively evaluated. Lesion diameters were measured on stereotactic thin-slice CT and MRI scans, and volumes of lesions were calculated concerning 36 pallidotomies and 14 thalamotomies in 46 patients who were operated using the same RF generator and same RF electrode. Results: The coagulation temperature, length of coagulated area and duration of coagulation were all correlated to the lesion volume. However, for a given length of coagulated area, the lesion's size was most strongly influenced by the temperature. Despite this clear correlation, and the relatively homogenous coagulation parameters, the lesions' volumes were markedly scattered. Conclusions: The volume of the stereotactic RF lesions could be correlated with the coagulation parameters, especially the temperature, at a group level, but could not be predicted in individual patients based solely on the RF coagulation parameters.

"Rapid Parametric Mapping of the Longitudinal Relaxation Time T-1 Using Two-Dimensional Variable Flip Angle Magnetic Resonance Imaging at 1.5 Tesla, 3 Tesla, and 7 Tesla",PLOS ONE,"Introduction: Visual but subjective reading of longitudinal relaxation time (T-1) weighted magnetic resonance images is commonly used for the detection of brain pathologies. For this non-quantitative measure, diagnostic quality depends on hardware configuration, imaging parameters, radio frequency transmission field (B-1(+)) uniformity, as well as observer experience. Parametric quantification of the tissue T-1 relaxation parameter offsets the propensity for these effects, but is typically time consuming. For this reason, this study examines the feasibility of rapid 2D T-1 quantification using a variable flip angles (VFA) approach at magnetic field strengths of 1.5 Tesla, 3 Tesla, and 7 Tesla. These efforts include validation in phantom experiments and application for brain T-1 mapping. Methods: T-1 quantification included simulations of the Bloch equations to correct for slice profile imperfections, and a correction for B-1(+). Fast gradient echo acquisitions were conducted using three adjusted flip angles for the proposed T-1 quantification approach that was benchmarked against slice profile uncorrected 2D VFA and an inversion-recovery spin-echo based reference method. Brain T-1 mapping was performed in six healthy subjects, one multiple sclerosis patient, and one stroke patient. Results: Phantom experiments showed a mean T-1 estimation error of (-63 +/- 1.5)% for slice profile uncorrected 2D VFA and (0.2 +/- 1.4)% for the proposed approach compared to the reference method. Scan time for single slice T-1 mapping including B-1(+) mapping could be reduced to 5 seconds using an in-plane resolution of (2x2) mm(2), which equals a scan time reduction of more than 99% compared to the reference method. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that rapid 2D T-1 quantification using a variable flip angle approach is feasible at 1.5T/3T/7T. It represents a valuable alternative for rapid T-1 mapping due to the gain in speed versus conventional approaches. This progress may serve to enhance the capabilities of parametric MR based lesion detection and brain tissue characterization."
Not Bad: Passive Leg Raising in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation-A New Modeling Study,FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY,"Aim: To evaluate, using a simulated haemodynamic circulation model, whether passive leg raising (PLR) is able to improve the effect during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); to expose the possible reasons why PLR works or not. Materials and Methods: We adapted a circulatory model for CPR with PLR. First we compared cardiac output (CO), coronary perfusion pressure (CPP), blood flow to heart (Q(heart)), and blood flow to neck and brain (Q(head)) of standard chest compression-only CPR with and without PLR; second we simulated the effects of PLR in different situations, by varying the thoracic pump factor (TPF) from 0 to 1; third we simulated the effects when the legs are lifted to the different heights. Finally, we compared our results with those obtained from a published clinical study. Results: According to the simulation model, (1) When TPF is in the interval (0,1), CPP, CO, Q(heart), and Q(head) are improved with PLR, among them with half-thoracic/half-cardiac pump effect (TPF is 0.5), CPP, CO, Q(head), and Q(heart) increase the most (by 14, 14, 15, and 17%). (2) When TPF is 1 (pure thoracic pump, with an emphysema or extremely thick thorax), PLR has almost no effect on CPP, CO, and Q(heart) (-1, 2, and 0%), whereas Q(head) is increased by 9%; (3) Regardless of whether there is a cardiac or thoracic pump effect, PLR is able to increase Q(head) by 9-15%. (4) When the legs are lifted to 30 degrees to the ground, the volume transferred from legs to upper body is 36% of the initial volume in legs; when the legs are lifted to 45 degrees, the volume transferred is 43%; when the legs are lifted to 60 degrees, the volume transferred is 47%; when the legs are lifted to 90 degrees, the volume transferred is 50%. Conclusion: Generally PLR is able to achieve improved cerebral perfusion and coronary perfusion. In some extreme situations, it has no effect on cardiac output and coronary perfusion, but still improves cerebral perfusion. PLR could be a beneficial supplement to CPR, and it is not necessary to lift the legs too high above the ground."
A new equivalence based metric for predictive check to qualify mixed-effects models,AAPS JOURNAL,"The main objective of any modeling exercise is to provide a rationale for effective decision making during drug development. The aim of the current simulation experiment was to evaluate the properties of predictive check as a covariate model qualification technique and, more importantly, to introduce and evaluate alternative criteria to qualify models. Original concentration-time profiles (y(od)) were simulated using a 1-compartment model for an intravenous drug administered to 25 men and 25 women. The typical clearance for male subjects (TVCLm) was assumed to be 5-fold higher than that for female subjects (TVCLf). Fifty such trials under the same design were generated randomly. Predictive check was used as the model qualification tool to study predictive performance of true (males, females) and false (males 5 females) models in the context of maximum likelihood estimation. For each yod, 200 replications were generated to study the properties of a discrepancy variable, a statistic that depends on the model, and a test statistic, a statistic that does not depend on the model. Several qualification criteria were evaluated in assessing predictive performance, such as, predictive p-value (Pp), probability of equivalence (p(eqv)), and probability of rejecting the null hypothesis (data 5 model) using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (p(ks)). The Pp value was calculated using sum of squared errors as a discrepancy variable. For both of the models, the Pp values uniformly ranged between 0 and 1. The pattern of Pp values suggests that qualification of the false model is unlikely. For both of the models, the range of peqv is about 0.95 to 1.0 for concentration at 0.5 hours. However, this is not the case for the concentration at 4 hours, which is primarily dependent on the clearance. The false model (0.35 to 0.50) has poor predictive performance compared with the true model (0.65 to 0.80) using p(eqv). The p(ks) suggests no difference in the distributions of replicated and original concentrations at all of the time points for both of the models. Discrepancy variables cannot aid in rejecting false models, whereas the use of a test statistic can aid in rejecting false models. However, selection of an informative test statistic is challenging. As far as the qualification criteria are considered, the equivalence-based comparison of a test statistic is more informative than a significance-based comparison. No convincing evidence exists in the literature demonstrating the added advantages of predictive check as a routine model qualification tool over the existing tools, such as diagnostic plots or mechanistic reasoning. However, when a model is to be used for designing a trial, it should at least be able to regenerate the data used to build the model. In such cases, predictive check might offer insights into potential inconsistencies."
Stereodivergent synthesis of 5-aminopipecotic acids and application in the preparation of a cyclic RGD peptidomimetic as a nanomolar alpha(v)beta(3) integrin ligand,ORGANIC & BIOMOLECULAR CHEMISTRY,"A stereodivergent strategy was devised to obtain enantiopure cis and trans 5-aminopipecolic acids (5-APAs) in suitably protected forms to be employed in peptide synthesis as conformationally constrained alpha- and delta-amino acids. The cis isomer was used as a delta-amino acid to construct a cyclic RGD-containing peptidomimetic, the ability of which to compete with biotinylated vitronectin for binding with the isolated alpha(v)beta(3) integrin was measured (IC50 = 4.2 +/- 0.9 nM). A complete H-1 NMR and computational conformational analysis was performed to elucidate the reasons for the high affinity of this cyclic peptidomimetic in comparison with cilengitide."
Cholesterol sensing by CD81 is important for hepatitis C virus entry,JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY,"CD81 plays a central role in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. Recent structural analysis of CD81 indicates that it contains an intramembrane cholesterol-binding pocket and that interaction with cholesterol may regulate a conformational switch in the large extracellular domain of CD81. Therefore, CD81 possesses a potential cholesterol-sensing mechanism; however, its relevance for protein function is thus far unknown. In this study we investigate CD81 cholesterol sensing in the context of its activity as a receptor for hepatitis C virus (HCV). Structure-led mutagenesis of the cholesterol-binding pocket reduced CD81-cholesterol association but had disparate effects on HCV entry, both reducing and enhancing CD81 receptor activity. We reasoned that this could be explained by alterations in the consequences of cholesterol binding. To investigate this further we performed molecular dynamic simulations of CD81 with and without cholesterol; this identified a potential allosteric mechanism by which cholesterol binding regulates the conformation of CD81. To test this, we designed further mutations to force CD81 into either the open (cholesterol-unbound) or closed (cholesterol-bound) conformation. The open mutant of CD81 exhibited reduced HCV receptor activity, whereas the closed mutant enhanced activity. These data are consistent with cholesterol sensing switching CD81 between a receptor active and inactive state. CD81 interactome analysis also suggests that conformational switching may modulate the assembly of CD81-partner protein networks. This work furthers our understanding of the molecular mechanism of CD81 cholesterol sensing, how this relates to HCV entry, and CD81's function as a molecular scaffold; these insights are relevant to CD81's varied roles in both health and disease."
Validation of biplane high-speed fluoroscopy combined with two different noninvasive tracking methodologies for measuring invivo distal limb kinematics of the horse,EQUINE VETERINARY JOURNAL,"Reason for performing studyBiplane high-speed fluoroscopy is a new method for gait analysis of the equine distal extremity. This is the first study validating the noninvasive tracking possibilities (Autoscoping and Scientific Rotoscoping) taking equine anatomy into account. ObjectivesTo determine the resolution with which Autoscoping and Scientific Rotoscoping depict motion of the equine phalanges in comparison to the invasive gold standard marker-based registration. Study designComparative exvivo study. MethodsIn 5 distal extremities of slaughtered ponies, 3 or 4 tantalum beads with 1mm diameter were implanted in each of the proximal, middle and distal phalangeal bones. Three-dimensional models of the bones were reconstructed using computed tomographic data (120kV, 50mA, slice thickness 1mm, increment 0.5). The beads were digitally removed from the bone models. Biplane fluoroscopic videos were taken at 69.53.5kV, 102.522.5mA, 500frames/s and 0.5ms shutter speed. The 5 specimens were moved in the trial field of the biplane fluoroscopic setup in a step-like motion (simulation of landing, main stance phase, lift-off). Marker-based registration, Autoscoping and Scientific Rotoscoping were carried out. For statistical analysis agreement was computed as percentiles, mean and s.d. ResultsThe medians of Scientific Rotoscoping ranged from 0.16 to 0.66mm in translations and 0.43 to 2.78 degrees in rotations, while values for Autoscoping were 0.13-0.70mm and 0.28-2.39 degrees respectively. With 2 exceptions, all differences between methods were statistically significant. Scientific Rotoscoping is more time efficient than Autoscoping and results in smaller maximum errors. Main limitationsThe experimental set-up was specifically designed to accommodate invivo requirements. Autoscoping was not manually corrected but rather expected to work automatically. ConclusionsIt is possible to noninvasively apply both Autoscoping and Scientific Rotoscoping for gait analysis of the equine phalanges with high precision. The summary is available in Chinese - see supporting information."
Prodrug-Based Targeting Approach for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Therapy: Mechanistic Study of Phospholipid-Linker-Cyclosporine PLA(2)-Mediated Activation,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES,"Therapeutics with activity specifically at the inflamed sites throughout the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) would be a major advance in our therapeutic approach to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to develop the prodrug approach that can allow such site-specific drug delivery. Currently, using cyclosporine as a drug of choice in IBD is limited to the most severe cases due to substantial systemic toxicities and narrow therapeutic index of this drug. Previously, we synthesized a series of a phospholipid-linker-cyclosporine (PLC) prodrugs designed to exploit the overexpression of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) in the inflamed intestinal tissues, as the prodrug-activating enzyme. Nevertheless, the extent and rate of prodrug activation differed significantly. In this study we applied in-vitro and modern in-silico tools based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, to gain insight into the dynamics and mechanisms of the PLC prodrug activation. We aimed to elucidate the reason for the significant activation change between different linker lengths in our prodrug design. Our work reveals that the PLC conjugate with the 12-carbon linker length yields the optimal prodrug activation by PLA(2) in comparison to shorter linker length (6-carbons). This optimized length efficiently allows cyclosporine to be released from the prodrug to the active pocket of PLA(2). This newly developed mechanistic approach, presented in this study, can be applied for future prodrug optimization to accomplish optimal prodrug activation and drug targeting in various conditions that include overexpression of PLA(2)."
Peer review program to enhance treatment planning quality assurance for community radiation oncologists,JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY,"Objective Many cancer patients are treated at treatment centers staffed by community radiation oncologists (CRO). Patients choose these facilities for location convenience and anticipate equivalent care to high volume centers despite contrary literature. Local CROs hypothesized that a two-step quality assurance (QA) program that added early contour and case review would improve confidence in radiation treatment plan quality and reduce variability across facilities. Methods Five physicians at five academic satellites participated in the pilot two-step QA program. This program established an efficient, secure, HIPPA compliant workflow to review case details and contours on CT simulation after uploading to a remote access server on a commercially available platform. Results Over 12 months, 148 patient contours were reviewed by at least one CRO with an average of 2 reviewers per case. Reviewers approved 67% without change, requested clarification or change in 28%, and would not approve 4% of cases unless revised. The most common reasons cited for change request were review GTV-volume increase and review CTV-volume increase. Eighty-eight percent of treated cases that were not approved initially subsequently completed recommended modifications. Published literature was shared for 29% cases and sub-specialist consulted for 19% of cases. Conclusion A two-step QA program was considered highly valuable by all participants allowing easily implanted mechanisms for standardization, higher case volume, and shared educational resources for small academic satellite CROs who are faced with the challenge of caring for a diverse community cancer population. Feasibility suggests the model could serve as a model for other CRO."
Inhibitory Effects of HIV-2 Vpx on Replication of HIV-1,JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 share a striking genomic resemblance; however, variability in the genetic sequence accounts for the presence of unique accessory genes, such as the viral protein X (vpx) gene in HIV-2. Dual infection with both viruses has long been described in the literature, yet the molecular mechanism of how dually infected patients tend to do better than those who are monoinfected with HIV-1 has not yet been explored. We hypothesized that in addition to extracellular mechanisms, an HIV-2 accessory gene is the culprit, and interference at the viral accessory/regulatory protein level is perhaps responsible for the attenuated pathogenicity of HIV-1 observed in dually infected patients. Following simulation of dual infection in cell culture experiments, we found that pretransduction of cells with HIV-2 significantly protects against HIV-1 transduction. Importantly, we have found that this dampening of the infectivity of HIV-1 was a result of interviral interference carried out by viral protein X of HIV-2, resulting in a severe hindrance to the replication dynamics of HIV-1, influencing both its early and late phases of the viral life cycle. Our findings shed light on potential intracellular interactions between the two viruses and broaden our understanding of the observed clinical spectrum in dually infected patients, highlighting HIV-2 Vpx as a potential candidate worth exploring in the fight against HIV-1. IMPORTANCE Dual infection with human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 is relatively common in areas of endemicity. For as-yet-unclarified reasons, patients who are dually infected were shown to have lower viral loads and generally a lower rate of progression to AIDS than those who are monoinfected. We aimed to explore dual infection in cell culture, to elucidate possible mechanisms by which HIV-2 may be able to exert such an effect. Our results indicate that on the cellular level, pretransduction of cells with HIV-2 significantly protects against HIV-1 transduction, which was found to be a result of interviral interference carried out by viral protein X of HIV-2. These findings broaden our knowledge of interviral interactions on the cellular level and may provide an explanation for the decreased pathogenicity of HIV-1 in dually infected patients, highlighting HIV-2 Vpx as a potential candidate worth exploring in the fight against HIV."
Environmental protection and biosecurity program at the National Institute of Psychiatry Ramon de la Fuente,SALUD MENTAL,"Since the beginning, mankind has been subjected to various natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, droughts and wildfires. Therefore, societies have to organize themselves in order to cope with nature, provide support to each other and to protect the most vulnerable individuals and their properties. Depending on their social organization, some countries have developed their response strategies in the field of civil protection faster than others. After September 19(th), 1985, when an earthquake of Richter magnitude of 8.1 affected Mexico City, the Mexican government decided to establish the guidelines of the National Civil Protection System (SINAPROC). After a few years, the Environmental Protection and Ecological Equilibrium Low was published. This environmental protection regulation is specific and is directed to minimize the negative impact over the environment that could be generated through industrial activities, as well as from research centers, hospitals, and others institutions. To ensure full compliance with the Mexican regulations, in 1998 the Instituto Nacional de Psiquiatria Roman de la Fuente (INPRF) initiated the Environmental and Civil Protection Program (ECPP). The aim of this program is to meet the legal and operational requirements applicable to an institution which has biomedical research, administration and hospitalization areas. In addition, the ECPP is in charge of giving workers training and generating specific strategies for environmental management in all activities that take place at the Institute. By establishing compliance guidelines to meet the government regulations on environmental and civil protection, the INPRF would develop strategies for minimizing risks, as well as staff training to enhance the use of institutional resources and reduce the response time to deal with emergencies. Objective Since its foundation, the environmental and civil protection program at the INPRF has had two basic objectives: 1. to attend the legal and operative requirements in a third level institution conformed by hospitalization, teaching, research and administrative areas, and 2. to offer continuous training to the internal population of a hospital in order to minimize work risks, to make an optimum use of the institutional resources and to reduce the response time of the workers in emergency situations. To develop and implement such an environmental and civil protection program, the following areas have been considered: Biohazardous wastes, saving electricity, use and optimization of drinking water, control of air emissions from stationary combustion equipment, radiation safety and emergency response procedures. The purpose of this work is to show the results achieved by ECPP after nine years since its inception. Results Biohazardous wastes (BW), by definition, are those materials generated during medical care which contain biological agents that may cause adverse effects to hut-non health and the environment. BW are generated frequently in biomedical research areas, clinical laboratories and hospitals. In order to minimize risks and prevent accidents, INPRF implemented since 1997 an operating procedure for handling biohazardous wastes in all generating areas. Some of those strategies are directed to training medical personnel (physicians, nurses and clinical laboratory technicians) about the identification and classification of biohazardous wastes. Moreover, we have designed and distributed different kinds of written ads in order to help people to recognize and separate wastes correctly. Besides the latter actions, the INPRF hired a registered and certificated company which provides the proper recollection, treatment and final disposal of biological wastes, according to current legal ordinances. As a result of those strategies in the handling of biohazardous wastes in the Institution, the amount of wastes and their disposal costs have gradually decreased. Through staff training, personnel have learned to do a proper segregation of wastes, reducing the quantities of BW and therefore reducing risks. Energy saving. As a way to optimize the institutional resources, as well as reducing costs and creating awareness among the people, the INPRF's Energy Saving program was implemented in 2003. Since 2003, when ECPP began implementing the saving strategies, accumulated energy consumption per year had a 9.6% reduction between 2004 and 2005. Use of potable water. In the search for strategies to optimize the use of potable water that is received through the municipal network, in 2003 the INPRF-ECPP implemented measures aimed not only at reducing the per capita consumption of potable water but also to give it a proper use on the institution areas. As a result of these saving measures, there was a gradual decrease in the use of drinking water. So, from the 170 liters/person-day used in 2003, during 2006 only 98 liters/person-day were used. Radiological safety. Due to the adverse effects to human health that could result from exposure to radioactive materials, an institution that uses this kind of material in its basic biomedical research area must implement the necessary actions to minimize the risk of contamination for users and work areas. For that reason, the INPRF began the Radiological Safety Program, which had as its main objectives to minimize the risks and to prevent accidents involving radioactive materials based on regulation compliance. As a result of these strategies, the maximum value of the total dose accumulated per year of ionizing radiation received by 1 personnel exposed who has carried out research in this institution in recent years has been of 3.14 mSv. Therefore, it had not exceeded the annual limit dose of ionizing radiation allowed for the total body by the Comision Nocional de Seguridad Nuclear y Salvaquardas (CNSNS) of 50 mSv = 5rem. To date, there has been no accidents or contamination with radioactive materials or wastes in the INPRF. Emergency simulations. Considering the need of being prepared for emergencies and to comply with the regulation that establishes the compulsory conducting simulations in INPRF, the Internal Committee for Civil Protection (ICPC) conducts periodic training of employees on risk prevention, through courses and simulations of situations of earthquake, attempt of fire, handling of hazardous substances spills and first aid. As a result of the earthquake simulations that have been carried out at the INPRF, the time of evacuation of workers, hospitalized patients and floating population from buildings has gradually reduced. An additional advantage of conducting emergency simulations has been the early defection of systematic security features that need to be repaired or installed. Emissions to air. In recent years, increasingly strict regulation and monitoring of gaseous emissions generated by stationary and mobile sources in Mexico City has been established. In order to comply with the current regulations, it became necessary to develop a program of annual preventive and corrective maintenance of combustion equipment that is used to provide hot water, and to make periodic analysis of gaseous emissions. Among the parameters that have to be reported are: temperature of combustion gases, monoxide and dioxide carbon content, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide percentages and generated soot. As a result of this program, the need of equipment that operates with cleaner technology was identified. Therefore, this change favored compliance with the maximum permissible limits for emissions of gaseous pollutants, besides a reduction of costs. Discussion In terms of environmental protection, it was found that through compliance with government regulations on environmental and civil protection, development of strategies for preventing risks, and staff training, it is possible to reduce the amounts of waste and pollution being released into the environment. Also that emphasizing awareness on the use of resources such as electricity and potable water results in a progressive responsible management and optimization by users. Finally, it was found that the investment of financial resources to implement and monitor a system of environmental and civil protection and training staff results directly in the protection of property and the environment, minimizing risks and preventing accidents."
Backscatter dose effects for high atomic number materials being irradiated in the presence of a magnetic field: A Monte Carlo study for the MRI linac,MEDICAL PHYSICS,"Purpose: To quantify and explain the backscatter dose effects for clinically relevant high atomic number materials being irradiated in the presence of a 1.5 T transverse magnetic field. Methods: Interface effects were investigated using Monte Carlo simulation techniques. We used GPUMCD (v5.1) and GEANT4 (V10.1) for this purpose. GPUMCD is a commercial software written for the Elekta AB, MRI linac. Dose was scored using GPUMCD in cubic voxels of side 1 and 0 5 mm, in two different virtual phantoms of dimensions 20 x 20 x 20 cm and 5 x 5 x 13.3 cm, respectively. A photon beam was generated from a point 143.5 cm away from the isocenter with energy distribution sampled from a histogram representing the true Elekta, MRI linac photon spectrum. A slab of variable thickness and position containing either bone, aluminum, titanium, stainless steel, or one of the two different dental filling materials was inserted as an inhomogeneity in the 20 x 20 x 20 cm phantom. The 5 x 5 x 13.3 cm phantom was used as a clinical test case in order to explain the dose perturbation effects for a head and neck cancer patient. The back scatter dose factor (BSDF) was defined as the ratio of the doses at a given depth with and without the presence of the inhomogeneity. Backscattered electron fluence was calculated at the inhomogeneity interface using GEANT4. A 1.5 T magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the direction of the beam in both phantoms, identical to the geometry in the Elekta MRI linac. Results: With the application of a 1.5 T magnetic field, all the BSDF's were reduced by 12%-47%, compared to the no magnetic field case. The corresponding backscattered electron fluence at the interface was also reduced by 45%-64%. The reduction in the BSDF at the interface, due to the application of the magnetic field, is manifested in a different manner for each material. In the case of bone, the dose drops at the interface contrary to the expected increase when no magnetic field is applied. In the case of aluminum, the dose at the interface is the same with and without the presence of the aluminum. For all of the other materials the dose increases at the interface. Conclusions: The reduction in dose at the interface, in the presence of the magnetic field, is directly related to the reduction in backscattered electron fluence. This reduction occurs due to two different reasons. First, the electron spectrum hitting the interface is changed when the magnetic field is turned on, which results in changes in the electron scattering probability. Second, some electrons that have curved trajectories due to the presence of the magnetic field are absorbed by the higher density side of the interface and no longer contribute to the backscattered electron fluence.

"Healthy food prescription incentive programme for adults with type 2 diabetes who are experiencing food insecurity: protocol for a randomised controlled trial, modelling and implementation studies",BMJ OPEN,"Introduction The high cost of many healthy foods poses a challenge to maintaining optimal blood glucose levels for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are experiencing food insecurity, leading to diabetes complications and excess acute care usage and costs. Healthy food prescription programmes may reduce food insecurity and support patients to improve their diet quality, prevent diabetes complications and avoid acute care use. We will use a type 2 hybrid-effectiveness design to exanine the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance (RE-AIM) of a healthy food prescription incentive programme for adults experiencing food insecurity and persistent hyperglycaemia. A randomised controlled trial (RCT) will investigate programme effectiveness via impact on glycosylated haemoglobin (primary outcome), food insecurity, diet quality and other dinical and patient-reported outcomes. A modelling study will estimate longer-term programme effectiveness in reducing diabetes-related complications, resource use and costs. An implementation study will examine all RE-AM domains to understand determinants of effective implementation and reasons behind programme successes and failures. Methods and analysis 594 adults who are experiencing food insecurity and persistent hyperglycaemia will be randomised to a healthy food prescription incentive (n=297) or a healthy food prescription comparison group (n=297). Both groups will receive a healthy food prescription. The incentive group will additionally receive a weekly incentive (CDN$10.50/household member) to purchase healthy foods in supermarkets for 6 months. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and followup (6 months) in the RCT and analysed using mixed-effects regression. Longer-term outcomes will be modelled using the UK Prospective Diabetes Study outcomes simulation model-2. Implementation processes and outcomes will be continuously measured via quantitative and qualitative data. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Calgary and the University of Alberta. Findings will be disseminated through reports, lay summaries, policy briefs, academic publications and conference presentations."
EULAR points to consider when analysing and reporting comparative effectiveness research using observational data in rheumatology,ANNALS OF THE RHEUMATIC DISEASES,"Background Comparing treatment effectiveness over time in observational settings is hampered by several major threats, among them confounding and attrition bias. Objectives To develop European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) points to consider (PtC) when analysing and reporting comparative effectiveness research using observational data in rheumatology. Methods The PtC were developed using a three-step process according to the EULAR Standard Operating Procedures. Based on a systematic review of methods currently used in comparative effectiveness studies, the PtC were formulated through two in-person meetings of a multidisciplinary task force and a two-round online Delphi, using expert opinion and a simulation study. Finally, feedback from a larger audience was used to refine the PtC. Mean levels of agreement among the task force were calculated. Results Three overarching principles and 10 PtC were formulated, addressing, in particular, potential biases relating to attrition or confounding by indication. Building on Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines, these PtC insist on the definition of the baseline for analysis and treatment effectiveness. They also focus on the reasons for stopping treatment as an important consideration when assessing effectiveness. Finally, the PtC recommend providing key information on missingness patterns. Conclusion To improve the reliability of an increasing number of real-world comparative effectiveness studies in rheumatology, special attention is required to reduce potential biases. Adherence to clear recommendations for the analysis and reporting of observational comparative effectiveness studies will improve the trustworthiness of their results."
Multidisciplinary study of biological parameters and fatigue evolution in quay crane operators,"6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON APPLIED HUMAN FACTORS AND ERGONOMICS (AHFE 2015) AND THE AFFILIATED CONFERENCES, AHFE 2015","In intermodal terminals the handling of containers and the number of accidents still depends on a wide range of human errors due to fatigue despite the automation level reached nowadays. For this reason it is very important to increase knowledge about the factors affecting the propensity of operators to make errors, increasing the chance of accidents happening. The aim of this work is to propose a novel approach to assess fatigue and performance levels in quay crane operators as a function of physiological parameters and of the many varying boundary conditions encountered in daily work. During their work, quay crane operators have to deal with variable environmental conditions, such as task type, wind speed and direction, lighting conditions that reduce visibility that can require an exacting level of attention. In the trial eight operators have been examined in a session lasting four hours. All actual conditions are reproduced through a fully immersive quay crane simulator. The operator completes the assigned task (the same for each one) and can see through four wide monitors a high quality virtual reality view of the simulation. Most biological parameters are acquired using different devices including a Holter ECG monitor, electromyographic monitoring the four trunk muscles most involved in the test, eye tracker and seat-body pressure interface for both seat pan and backrest. Changes in physiological parameters have been monitored during the trial and interesting correlations with performance levels and boundary conditions have been found for each operator, in accordance with their age and skills. The present study can form the basis for further investigations aimed at developing a cost effective, reliable and robust system for monitoring increasing fatigue and for predicting the critical conditions that may result in an accident.

The Impact of Arterial Input Function Determination Variations on Prostate Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Pharmacokinetic Modeling: A Multicenter Data Analysis Challenge,TOMOGRAPHY,"Pharmacokinetic analysis of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI data allows estimation of quantitative imaging biomarkers such as K-trans (rate constant for plasma/interstitium contrast reagent (CR) transfer) and v(e) (extravascular and extracellular volume fraction). However, the use of quantitative DCE-MRI in clinical practice is limited with uncertainty in arterial input function (AIF) determination being one of the primary reasons. In this multicenter study to assess the effects of AIF variations on pharmacokinetic parameter estimation, DCE-MRI data acquired at one center from 11 prostate cancer patients were shared among nine centers. Individual AIF from each data set was determined by each center and submitted to the managing center. These AIFs, along with a literature population averaged AIF, and their reference-tissue-adjusted variants were used by the managing center to perform pharmacokinetic data analysis using the Tofts model (TM). All other variables, including tumor region of interest (ROI) definition and pre-contrast T1, were kept constant to evaluate parameter variations caused solely by AIF discrepancies. Considerable parameter variations were observed with the within-subject coefficient of variation (wCV) of K-trans obtained with unadjusted AIFs being as high as 0.74. AIF-caused variations were larger in K-trans than v(e) and both were reduced when reference-tissue-adjusted AIFs were used. These variations were largely systematic, resulting in nearly unchanged parametric map patterns. The intravasation rate constant, k(ep) (similar to K-trans/v(e)), was less sensitive to AIF variation than K-trans (wCV for unadjusted AIFs: 0.45 vs. 0.74), suggesting that it might be a more robust imaging biomarker of prostate microvasculature than K-trans."
Uncovering the Effect of pS202/pT205/pS208 Triple Phosphorylations on the Conformational Features of the Key Fragment G192-T212 of Tau Protein,ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE,"Microtubule-associated protein tau is abnormally phosphorylated and forms the aggregates of paired helical filaments in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. So far, the relationship and mechanism between the abnormal phosphorylation of tau and fibril formation is still unclear. Therefore, studying the effect of phosphorylation on the structure of tau protein is helpful to elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of tauopathies. It has been shown that pS202/pT205/pS208 triple phosphorylations located in the proline-rich region can promote tau aggregation. In this work, the effect of triple phosphorylations on tau structure was investigated by molecular dynamics simulations combined with multiple analytical methods of trajectories. The results showed that the conformational diversity of G192-T212 fragments decreased after phosphorylation compared with that of the wild-type. Moreover, the dynamic network and hydrogen bond analyses showed that the addition of pS208 phosphorylation can destroy the key hydrogen bonds and the network structure formed centered on pT205 at the C-terminal of the pS202/pT205 double phosphorylated peptide and then destroy the turn structure formed in the region of G207-R211. The destruction of this turn structure is considered to be the main reason for the aggregation of pS202/pT205/pS208 triple phosphorylations. For the pS202/pT205/pS208 triple phosphorylated system, the G207-R211 region is a coil structure, which is more extended and prone to aggregation. In a word, our results reveal the mechanism that pS202/pT205/pS208 triple phosphorylations promote tau aggregation at the atomic level, which can provide useful theoretical guidance for the rational design of effective therapeutic drugs against AD and other tauopathies."
A preliminary model study of the equine back including activity of longissimus dorsi muscle,EQUINE VETERINARY JOURNAL,"P>Reasons for performing study: Identifying the underlying problem of equine back pain and diseases of the spine are significant problems in veterinary orthopaedics. A study to validate a preliminary biomechanical model of the equine back based on CT images including longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle is therefore important. Objectives: Validation of the back model by comparing the shortening of LD muscles in the model with integrated EMG (IEMG) at stance during induced lateral flexion of the spine. Methods: Longissimus dorsi muscle activity at stance has been used for validation. EMG electrodes were placed laterally at the level of T12, T16 and L3. Reflective markers have been attached on top of the spinous processes T5, T12, T16, L1 and the sacral bone (OS1, OS2) for motion tracking analysis. A virtual model of the equine's back (T1-S5) was built with inclusion of a simplified LD muscle by 2 separate contours left and right of the spine, starting at tuber coxae laterally and attaching to the spinous process T5 medially. Shortening of LD during induced lateral flexion caused by the kinematic data (input) was compared to the 3 EMG signals (T12, T16 and L3) on the active side via correlation. Results: Pearson correlation coefficient between IEMG and shortening length of LD in the model was (mean +/- s.d.) 0.95 +/- 0.07 for the left side and 0.91 +/- 0.07 for the right side of LD. Conclusions: Activity of the LD muscles is mainly responsible for stabilisation of the vertebral column with isometric muscle contraction against dynamic forces in walk and trot. This validation requires muscle shortening in the back, like induced lateral flexion at stance. The length of the shortening muscle model and the IEMG show a linear relationship. These findings will help to model the LD for forward simulations, e.g. from force to motion."
Mode of birth in twins: data and reflections,JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY,"Our primary objective was to compare neonatal and maternal outcomes in women with twin pregnancies, beyond 32weeks, having a planned vaginal birth or a planned caesarean section (CS). This was a retrospective cohort study from a single tertiary centre over nineyears. 534 sets of twins32+0weeks of gestation were included. 401 sets were planned vaginally and 133 sets were planned by CS. We compared a composite adverse perinatal outcome (perinatal mortality or serious neonatal morbidity; five minute APGAR score4, neurological abnormality and need for intubation) and a composite maternal adverse outcome (major haemorrhage, trauma or infection) between the groups. There were no significant differences. Given the similarity of these results with several other larger studies of twin birth, we sought to look at reasons why there is still a rising rate of CS for twin births. We further make suggestions for keeping this rate to a sensible minimum.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? The largest randomised controlled study comparing planned vaginal birth with planned CSs for lower risk twins between 32 and 39 weeks of gestation, showed no added safety from planned CS. However, in most of the Western countries this conclusion has failed to increase the number of planned vaginal births for lower risk twins.What do the results of this study add? This observational study from a single tertiary centre provides external validation of the twin trial results in a practical day-to-day setting. It also provides insights as to how planned vaginal birth can be developed and maintained, with a key focus on safety and maternal participation in decision making. It does focus on consent and providing accurate data.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? There are good grounds to encourage vaginal birth for low-risk twin pregnancies. The trend of rising caesarean rates in low-risk twin pregnancies worldwide will erode important skills for the conduct of vaginal births without any clear benefit for mothers or babies. The current situation demands careful thought about implementing innovative training opportunities for younger obstetricians. Finally, we need intelligent responses to many non-evidence-based factors which can drive clinical practice."
Influence of operator experience on vertical force during instrumentation using Neoniti rotary files,GIORNALE ITALIANO DI ENDODONZIA,"Aim: This study aimed to measure the vertical force developed during canal instrumentation with Neoniti rotary files at predetermined torque in relation to the operator's experience. Methodology: The research was performed on 60 human maxillary and mandibular incisors extracted for periodontal reasons. Each group of 20 teeth (10 maxillary and 10 mandibular incisors) was prepared by three different operators with different levels of experience in endodontics: a fresh dental school graduate, a postgraduate student training in endodontics and an endodontic specialist. Maxillary incisors represented the experimental model of wide root canals while mandibular incisors represented a model of narrow root canals. Root canals were prepared employing Neoniti files and TCM Endo unit at speed and torque recommended by the manufacturer. Vertical force measurement was performed utilizing device constructed for this purpose. Statistical analysis was accomplished using Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test and Spearman's rank correlation. Results: The amount of vertical force was significantly higher in narrow than in wide root canals (P=0.001). Comparison of vertical forces developed by three different operators demonstrated significant differences (P<0.001). Median vertical force developed by postgraduate student was significantly lower than in other two operators (both P<0.01). In postgraduate student, a significant positive correlation between number of shaped root canals and vertical force was demonstrated (rho= 0.490; P= 0.003). Conclusions: The postgraduate with limited experience in rotary instrumentation had on average lowest values of vertical force as opposed to other two operators. However, these values increased with the number of shaped root canals."
A Review of Statistical Methods for Testing Genetic Anticipation: Looking for an Answer in Lynch Syndrome,GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY,"Anticipation, manifested through decreasing age of onset or increased severity in successive generations, has been noted in several genetic diseases. Statistical methods for genetic anticipation range from a simple use of the paired t-test for age of onset restricted to affected parent-child pairs to a recently proposed random effects model which includes extended pedigree data and unaffected family members [Larsen et al., 2009]. A naive use of the paired t-test is biased for the simple reason that age of onset has to be less than the age at ascertainment (interview) for both affected parent and child, and this right truncation effect is more pronounced in children than in parents. In this study, we first review different statistical methods for testing genetic anticipation in affected parent-child pairs that address the issue of bias due to right truncation. Using affected parent-child pair data, we compare the paired t-test with the parametric conditional maximum likelihood approach of Huang and Vieland [1997] and the nonparametric approach of Rabinowitz and Yang [1999] in terms of Type I error and power under various simulation settings and departures from the modeling assumptions. We especially investigate the issue of multiplex ascertainment and its effect on the different methods. We then focus on exploring genetic anticipation in Lynch syndrome and analyze new data on the age of onset in affected parent-child pairs from families seen at the University of Michigan Cancer Genetics clinic with a mutation in one of the three main mismatch repair (MMR) genes. In contrast to the clinic-based population, we re-analyze data on a population-based Lynch syndrome cohort, derived from the Danish HNPCC-register. Both datasets indicate evidence of genetic anticipation in Lynch syndrome. We then expand our review to incorporate recently proposed statistical methods that consider family instead of affected pairs as the sampling unit. These prospective censored regression models offer additional flexibility to incorporate unaffected family members, familial correlation and other covariates into the analysis. An expanded dataset from the Danish HNPCC-register is analyzed by this alternative set of methods. Genet. Epidemiol. 34:756-768, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
"Anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities of tanshinone IIA, carnosic acid, rosmarinic acid, salvianolic acid, baicalein, and glycyrrhetinic acid between computational and in vitro insights",RSC ADVANCES,"Six compounds namely, tanshinone IIA (1), carnosic acid (2), rosmarinic acid (3), salvianolic acid B (4), baicalein (5), and glycyrrhetinic acid (6) were screened for their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities against both the spike (S) and main protease (Mpro) receptors using molecular docking studies. Molecular docking recommended the superior affinities of both salvianolic acid B (4) and glycyrrhetinic acid (6) as the common results from the previously published computational articles. On the other hand, their actual anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities were tested in vitro using plaque reduction assay to calculate their IC50 values after measuring their CC50 values using MTT assay on Vero E6 cells. Surprisingly, tanshinone IIA (1) was the most promising member with IC50 equals 4.08 ng mu l(-)(1). Also, both carnosic acid (2) and rosmarinic acid (3) showed promising IC50 values of 15.37 and 25.47 ng mu l(-)(1), respectively. However, salvianolic acid (4) showed a weak anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity with an IC50 value equals 58.29 ng mu l(-)(1). Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations for 100 ns were performed for the most active compound from the computational point of view (salvianolic acid 4), besides, the most active one biologically (tanshinone IIA 1) on both the S and Mpro complexes of them (four different molecular dynamics processes) to confirm the docking results and give more insights regarding the stability of both compounds inside the SARS-CoV-2 mentioned receptors, respectively. Also, to understand the mechanism of action for the tested compounds towards SARS-CoV-2 inhibition it was necessary to examine the mode of action for the most two promising compounds, tanshinone IIA (1) and carnosic acid (2). Both compounds (1 and 2) showed very promising virucidal activity with a most prominent inhibitory effect on viral adsorption rather than its replication. This recommended the predicted activity of the two compounds against the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 rather than its Mpro protein. Our results could be very promising to rearrange the previously mentioned compounds based on their actual inhibitory activities towards SARS-CoV-2 and to search for the reasons behind the great differences between their in silico and in vitro results against SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we recommend further advanced preclinical and clinical studies especially for tanshinone IIA (1) to be rapidly applied in COVID-19 management either alone or in combination with carnosic acid (2), rosmarinic acid (3), and/or salvianolic acid (4)."
Mathematical modeling of endovenous laser treatment (ELT),BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE,"Background and objectives: Endovenous laser treatment (ELT) has been recently proposed as an alternative in the treatment of reflux of the Great Saphenous Vein (GSV) and Small Saphenous Vein (SSV). Successful ELT depends on the selection of optimal parameters required to achieve an optimal vein damage while avoiding side effects. Mathematical modeling of ELT could provide a better understanding of the ELT process and could determine the optimal dosage as a function of vein diameter. Study design/materials and methods: The model is based on calculations describing the light distribution using the diffusion approximation of the transport theory, the temperature rise using the bioheat equation and the laser-induced injury using the Arrhenius damage model. The geometry to simulate ELT was based on a 2D model consisting of a cylindrically symmetric blood vessel including a vessel wall and surrounded by an infinite homogenous tissue. The mathematical model was implemented using the Macsyma-Pdease2D software (Macsyma Inc., Arlington, MA, USA). Damage to the vein wall for CW and single shot energy was calculated for 3 and 5 mm vein diameters. In pulsed mode, the pullback distance (3, 5 and 7 mm) was considered. For CW mode simulation, the pullback speed (1, 2, 3 mm/s) was the variable. The total dose was expressed as joules per centimeter in order to perform comparison to results already reported in clinical studies. Results: In pulsed mode, for a 3 mm vein diameter, irrespective of the pullback distance (2, 5 or 7 mm), a minimum fluence of 15 J/cm is required to obtain a permanent damage of the intima. For a 5 mm vein diameter, 50 J/cm (15W-2s) is required. In continuous mode, for a 3 mm and 5 mm vein diameter, respectively 65 J/cm and 100 J/cm are required to obtain a permanent damage of the vessel wall. Finally, the use of different wavelengths (810 nm or 980 nm) played only a minor influence on these results. Discussion and conclusion: The parameters determined by mathematical modeling are in agreement with those used in clinical practice. They confirm that thermal damage of the inner vein wall (tunica intima) is required to achieve the tissue alterations necessary in order to lead the vein to permanent occlusion. However, in order to obtain a high rate of success without adverse events, the knowledge of the vein diameter after tumescent anesthesia is recommended in order to use the optimal energy. As clearly demonstrated by our calculations, both pulsed and continuous mode operations of the laser can be efficient. An interesting observation in our model is that less amount of energy is required in pulsed mode than in continuous mode. Damaging the vein sequentially along its entire length may lead to permanent occlusion. However, the pulsed mode requires a very precise positioning of the fiber after each pullback and the duration of the treatment is much longer. For these reasons, continuous irradiation seems to be preferred by most clinicians. This model should serve as a useful tool to simulate and better understand the mechanism of action of the ELT."
"Carbapenem-sparing strategy: carbapenemase, treatment, and stewardship",CURRENT OPINION IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES,"Purpose of review describing the current role of carbapenems and carbapenem-sparing strategies in the setting of antimicrobial stewardship programs. Recent findings sparing carbapenems with other drugs appears to be an interesting perspective for a variety of reasons in the current context of the multidrug-resistant (MDR) pandemic. Specific algorithms should also be precisely investigated to define better how to spare carbapenems within empiric and targeted regimens, with combination treatment or monotherapies, aiming at the best use of the new drugs and improving deescalation as soon as possible for most of the patients. Summary stewardship programs may be useful in reducing probable misuse and overuse of antibiotics, which has probably contributed to the emergence of carbapenem-resistant bacteria worldwide. The proposal of carbapenem-sparing strategies has then generated substantial scientific debate and, overall, the concept of sparing these drugs is well advocated together with judicious use of novel drugs, appropriate measures of infection control and prevention as well as in stewardship programs to curb the spread of MDR and XDR-strains in healthcare facilities."
Increased temperature at the healed area detected by thermography predicts recurrent pressure ulcers,WOUND REPAIR AND REGENERATION,"Preventing recurrent pressure ulcers is an important challenge in healthcare. One of the reasons for the high rate of recurrent pressure ulcers is the lack of assessment methods for their early detection. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the thermographic characteristics of the healed area and to consider the predictive validity of thermographic images for recurrent pressure ulcers within a 2-week period. This observational study was conducted at a long-term care facility in Japan between July 2017 and February 2019 among patients whose pressure ulcers had healed. Thermographic images of the healed area were recorded once a week until recurrence or until the end of the study. We enrolled 30 participants, among whom 8 developed recurrent pressure ulcers. The generalised estimation equation revealed that the thermographic finding of increased temperature at the healed area compared to that of the surrounding skin was significantly associated with recurrent pressure ulcers (odds ratio: 101.13, 95% confidence interval: 3.60-2840.77, p = .007); the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio for recurrent pressure ulcers within 2 weeks were 0.80, 0.94, 0.62, 0.97, 12.9 and 0.2, respectively. Our thermographic findings revealed that the temperature of the healed area was higher than that of the surrounding skin; this could be a useful predictor of pressure ulcer recurrence within 2 weeks, even in the absence of macroscopic changes."
Evaluation of dosimetric margins in prostate IMRT treatment plans,MEDICAL PHYSICS,"This work introduces a new concept-the dosimetric margin distribution (DMD)-and uses it to explain the sensitivity of a group of prostate IMRT treatment plans to patient setup errors. Prior work simulated the effect of setup errors on 27 prostate IMRT treatment plans and found the plans could tolerate larger setup errors than predicted by the van Herk margin formula. The conjectured reason for this disagreement was a breakdown in van Herk's assumption that the planned dose distribution conforms perfectly to target structures. To resolve the disagreement, this work employed the same 27 plans to evaluate the actual margin distributions that exist between: (i) the clinical target volume (CTV) and planning target volume (PTV) and (ii) the CTV and PTV minimum dose isodose surface. These distributions were evaluated for both prostate and nodal targets. Distribution (ii) is the DMD. The dosimetric margin in a given direction determines the probability that the CTV will be underdosed due to setup errors in that direction. Averaging over 4 pi sr gives the overall probability of CTV coverage. Minimum doses for prostate and nodal PTVs were obtained from dose volume histograms. Corresponding isodose surfaces were created and converted to regions of interest (ROIs). CTV, PTV, and isodose ROIs were saved as mesh files and then imported into a computational geometry application which calculated distances between meshes (i.e., margins) in 614 discrete directions covering 4 pi sr in 10 deg increments. Measured prostate CTV-to-PTV margins were close to the nominal value of 0.5 cm specified in the treatment planning protocol. However, depending on direction, prostate dosimetric margins ranged from 0.5 to 3 cm, reflecting the imperfect conformance of the planned dose distribution to the prostate PTV. For the nodal CTV, the nominal CTV-to-PTV margin employed in treatment planning was again 0.5 cm. However, due to the planning protocol, the nodal PTV follows the surface of the nodal CTV in several places, ensuring that there is no room for rigid body motion of the nodal CTV inside the nodal PTV. Measured nodal CTV-to-PTV margins were therefore zero, while nodal dosimetric margins ranged from 0.2 to 2.8 cm. Prostate and nodal target coverage were found to be well correlated with the measured DMDs, thereby resolving the apparent disagreement with our prior results. The principal conclusion is that target coverage in the presence of setup errors should be evaluated using the DMD, rather than the CTV-to-PTV margin distribution. The DMD is a useful planning metric, which generalizes the ICRU conformity index. DMDs could vary with number of beams, beam arrangements, TPS, and treatment site.

"Efficacy and safety of nelfinavir in asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 patients: a structured summary of a study protocol for a multicenter, randomized controlled trial",TRIALS,"Objectives: The aim of this trial is to evaluate the antiviral efficacy, clinical efficacy, and safety of nelfinavir in patients with asymptomatic and mild COVID-19. Trial design: The study is designed as a multicenter, open-label, blinded outcome assessment, parallel group, investigator-initiated, exploratory, randomized (1:1 ratio) controlled clinical trial. Participants: Asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 patients will be enrolled in 10 university and teaching hospitals in Japan. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are as follows: Inclusion criteria: (1) Japanese male or female patients aged >= 20 years (2) SARS-CoV-2 detected from a respiratory tract specimen (e.g., nasopharyngeal swab or saliva) using PCR, LAMP, or an antigen test within 3 days before obtaining the informed consent (3) Provide informed consent Exclusion criteria: (1) Symptoms developed >= 8 days prior to enrolment (2) SpO(2) < 96 % (room air) (3) Any of the following screening criteria: a) ALT or AST >= 5 x upper limit of the reference range b) Child-Pugh class B or C c) Serum creatinine >= 2 x upper limit of the reference range and creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min (4) Poorly controlled diabetes (random blood glucose >= 200 mg/dL or HbA1c >= 7.0%, despite treatment) (5) Unsuitable serious complications based on the assessment of either the principal investigator or the sub-investigator (6) Hemophiliac or patients with a marked hemorrhagic tendency (7) Severe diarrhea (8) Hypersensitivity to the investigational drug (9) Breastfeeding or pregnancy (10) With childbearing potential and rejecting contraceptive methods during the study period from the initial administration of the investigational drug (11) Receiving rifampicin within the previous 2 weeks (12) Participated in other clinical trials and received drugs within the previous 12 weeks (13) Undergoing treatment for HIV infection (14) History of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination or wishes to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (15) Deemed inappropriate (for miscellaneous reasons) based on the assessment of either the principal investigator or the sub-investigator Intervention and comparator: Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and do not meet any of the exclusion criteria will be randomized to either the nelfinavir group or the symptomatic treatment group. The nelfinavir group will be administered 750 mg of nelfinavir orally, three times daily for 14 days (treatment period). However, if a participant tests negative on two consecutive PCR tests of saliva samples, administration of the investigational drug for that participant can be discontinued at the discretion of the investigators. The symptomatic treatment group will not be administered the investigational drug, but all other study procedures and conditions will be the same for both groups for the duration of the treatment period. After the treatment period of 14 days, each group will be followed up for 14 days (observational period). Main outcomes: The primary endpoint is the time to negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2. During the study period from Day 1 to Day 28, two consecutive negative PCR results of saliva samples will be considered as the negative conversion of the virus. The secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: For patients with both asymptomatic and mild disease: area under the curve of viral load, half decay period of viral load, body temperature at each time point, all-cause mortality, incidence rate of pneumonia, percentage of patients with newly developed pneumonia, rate of oxygen administration, and the percentage of patients who require oxygen administration. For asymptomatic patients: incidence of symptomatic COVID-19, incidence of fever (>= 37.0 degrees C for two consecutive days), incidence of cough For patients with mild disease: incidence of defervescence (< 37.0 degrees C), incidence of recovery from clinical symptoms, incidence of improvement of each symptom The secondary safety endpoints are adverse events and clinical examinations. Randomization: Patients will be randomized to either the nelfinavir group or the symptomatic treatment group using the electric data capture system (1:1 ratio, dynamic allocation based on severity [asymptomatic], and age [< 60 years]). Blinding (masking) Only the assessors of the primary outcome will be blinded (blinded outcome assessment). Numbers to be randomized (sample size) The sample size was determined based on our power analysis to reject the null hypothesis, S (t | z =1) = S (t | z = 0) where S is a survival function, t is time to negative conversion, and z denotes randomization group, by the log-rank test with a two-sided p value of 0.05. We estimated viral dynamic parameters by fitting a nonlinear mixed-effects model to reported viral load data, and simulated our primary endpoint from viral-load time-courses that were realized from sets of viral dynamics parameters sampled from the estimated probability distribution of the parameters (sample size: 2000; 1000 each for randomization group). From this estimation of the hazard ratio between the randomization groups for the event of negative conversion using this simulation dataset, the required number of events for rejecting our null hypothesis with a power of 0.80 felled 97.345 by plugging the estimated hazard ratio, 1.79, in Freedman's equation. Therefore, we decided the required number of randomizations to be 120 after consideration of the frequency of censoring and the anticipated rate of withdrawal caused by factors such as withdrawal of consent. Trial Status: Protocol version 6.0 of February 12, 2021. Recruitment started on July 22, 2020 and is anticipated to be completed by March 31, 2022.

From cells to tissue: How cell scale heterogeneity impacts glioblastoma growth and treatment response,PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY,"Glioblastomas are aggressive primary brain tumors known for their inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity. This disease is uniformly fatal, with intratumor heterogeneity the major reason for treatment failure and recurrence. Just like the nature vs nurture debate, heterogeneity can arise from intrinsic or environmental influences. Whilst it is impossible to clinically separate observed behavior of cells from their environmental context, using a mathematical framework combined with multiscale data gives us insight into the relative roles of variation from different sources. To better understand the implications of intratumor heterogeneity on therapeutic outcomes, we created a hybrid agent-based mathematical model that captures both the overall tumor kinetics and the individual cellular behavior. We track single cells as agents, cell density on a coarser scale, and growth factor diffusion and dynamics on a finer scale over time and space. Our model parameters were fit utilizing serial MRI imaging and cell tracking data from ex vivo tissue slices acquired from a growth-factor driven glioblastoma murine model. When fitting our model to serial imaging only, there was a spectrum of equally-good parameter fits corresponding to a wide range of phenotypic behaviors. When fitting our model using imaging and cell scale data, we determined that environmental heterogeneity alone is insufficient to match the single cell data, and intrinsic heterogeneity is required to fully capture the migration behavior. The wide spectrum of in silico tumors also had a wide variety of responses to an application of an anti-proliferative treatment. Recurrent tumors were generally less proliferative than pre-treatment tumors as measured via the model simulations and validated from human GBM patient histology. Further, we found that all tumors continued to grow with an anti-migratory treatment alone, but the anti-proliferative/anti-migratory combination generally showed improvement over an anti-proliferative treatment alone. Together our results emphasize the need to better understand the underlying phenotypes and tumor heterogeneity present in a tumor when designing therapeutic regimens."
Determinants of the Cost-Effectiveness of Intermittent Preventive Treatment for Malaria in Infants and Children,PLOS ONE,"Background: Trials of intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi) and children (IPTc) have shown promising results in reducing malaria episodes but with varying efficacy and cost-effectiveness. The effects of different intervention and setting characteristics are not well known. We simulate the effects of the different target age groups and delivery channels, seasonal or year-round delivery, transmission intensity, seasonality, proportions of malaria fevers treated and drug characteristics. Methods: We use a dynamic, individual-based simulation model of Plasmodium falciparum malaria epidemiology, antimalarial drug action and case management to simulate DALYs averted and the cost per DALY averted by IPTi and IPTc. IPT cost components were estimated from economic studies alongside trials. Results: IPTi and IPTc were predicted to be cost-effective in most of the scenarios modelled. The cost-effectiveness is driven by the impact on DALYs, particularly for IPTc, and the low costs, particularly for IPTi which uses the existing delivery strategy, EPI. Cost-effectiveness was predicted to decrease with low transmission, badly timed seasonal delivery in a seasonal setting, short-acting and more expensive drugs, high frequencies of drug resistance and high levels of treatment of malaria fevers. Seasonal delivery was more cost-effective in seasonal settings, and year-round in constant transmission settings. The difference was more pronounced for IPTc than IPTi due to the different proportions of fixed costs and also different assumed drug spacing during the transmission season. The number of DALYs averted was predicted to decrease as a target five-year age-band for IPTc was shifted from children under 5 years into older ages, except at low transmission intensities. Conclusions: Modelling can extend the information available by predicting impact and cost-effectiveness for scenarios, for outcomes and for multiple strategies where, for practical reasons, trials cannot be carried out. Both IPTi and IPTc are generally cost-effective but could be rendered cost-ineffective by characteristics of the setting, drug or implementation."
Effect of transcorporeal percutaneous endoscopic cervical discectomy on vertebral integrity,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE,"Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effect of transcorporeal percutaneous endoscopic cervical discectomy (TcPECD) for cervical spondylosis on vertebral integrity and potential complications due to bone defects by 3-D computed tomography (CT). Background: TcPECD can cause bone defects when a surgeon establishes a working channel in the vertebral body. The surgeon ensures surgical safety and improves surgical outcomes according to learning about potential surgical risks, such as the position of working channel, the site and degree of bone defects, the reasons of bleeding in vertebral body, and so on. Method: 1. The preoperative and postoperative VAS (visual analogue score), JOA (Japanese Orthopedics Association) score, muscle strength, and other characteristics of a patient with myeloid cervical spondylosis treated through TcPECD were evaluated 2. The CT of cervical vertebra before surgery and 3 days after surgery was examined, and the 3-D CT image was reconstructed. The location of bony passages, the location and degree of bone defects, the CT bone mineral density of each part of vertebral body, the location of foramina nutricium of venae basivertebrales were observed. Possible complications were analyzed. 3. We made a cylindrical guide with the diameter of the bone channel of the patient, simulated channel establishment, determined the channel position of the maximum reduction of bone defect, and then reached the objective of the operation. Result: 1. VAS score of the left upper limb: preoperative 7 points and postoperative 3 points, JOA score: preoperative 12 points and postoperative 15 points, and muscle strength of left upper limb: preoperative grade III and postoperative grade IV. 2. The columnar osseous channel with a diameter of 3.3 mm was from the left front to the upper left of the vertebral body of C6. The longest defect of the vertebral upper endplate was 7.87 mm, and the widest defect was 7.09 mm. The linear distance of the defect of apophyseal ring was 6.43 mm. The CT bone density in the junctional zone between the posterior part of the processus hamularis and apophyseal ring was the highest (1649.64 Hu). The vertebral vein plexus vallecula was located in the central region of the vertebral body. The bone loss (128.29 mm(3)) of bone channel in patients was lower than those of the other parts of 3-D CT simulation. Conclusion: 1. TcPECD caused the bone defect of the vertebral body and might lead to the destruction of the lateral part of the upper endplate and the apophyseal ring."
Musculoskeletal modelling of the dragonfly mandible system as an aid to understanding the role of single muscles in an evolutionary context,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,"Insects show a great variety of mouthpart and muscle configurations; however, knowledge of their mouthpart kinematics and muscle activation patterns is fragmentary. Understanding the role of muscle groups during movement and comparing them between insect groups could yield insights into evolutionary patterns and functional constraints. Here, we developed a mathematical inverse dynamic model including distinct muscles for an insect head-mandible-muscle complex based on micro-computed tomography (mu CT) data and bite force measurements. With the advent of mu CT, it is now possible to obtain precise spatial information about muscle attachment areas and head capsule construction in insects. Our model shows a distinct activation pattern for certain fibre groups potentially related to a geometry-dependent optimization. Muscle activation patterns suggest that intramandibular muscles play a minor role in bite force generation, which is a potential reason for their loss in several lineages of higher insects. Our model is in agreement with previous studies investigating fast and slow muscle fibres and is able to resolve the spatio-temporal activation patterns of these different muscle types in insects. The model used here has a high potential for large-scale comparative analyses on the role of different muscle setups and head capsule designs in the megadiverse insects in order to aid our understanding of insect head capsule and mouthpart evolution under mechanical constraints."
Lipopolysaccharide Preparation Derived From Porphyromonas gingivalis Induces a Weaker Immuno-Inflammatory Response in BV-2 Microglial Cells Than Escherichia coli by Differentially Activating TLR2/4-Mediated NF-kappa B/STAT3 Signaling Pathways,FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system with unclear etiology and pathogenesis. In recent years, as the infectious theory and endotoxin hypothesis of AD has gained substantial attention, several studies have proposed that Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), one of the main pathogenic bacteria of chronic periodontitis, and the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of P. gingivalis may lead to AD-like pathological changes and cognition impairment. However, research on the relationship between P. gingivalis-LPS and neuroinflammation is still lacking. Our study aimed to investigate the effects of P. gingivalis-LPS preparation on immuno-inflammation in microglial cells and further compared the differential inflammatory response induced by P. gingivalis-LPS and Escherichia coli (E. coli) LPS preparations. The results showed that P. gingivalis-LPS could upregulate the gene expression and release of pro-inflammatory factors in BV-2 microglial cells, including IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-17, and IL-23. We also observed an increase in the level of Toll-like receptor 2/4 (TLR2/4) and NF-kappa B/STAT3 signaling. Moreover, the changes mentioned above were more significant in the E. coli-LPS group and the effects of both kinds of LPS could be differentially reversed by the administration of the TLR2 inhibitor C29 and TLR4 inhibitor TAK-242. The molecular simulation showed that the binding affinity of P. gingivalis-lipid A to TLR4-MD-2 was weaker than E. coli-lipid A, which was probably due to the presence of fewer acyl chains and phosphate groups of P. gingivalis-lipid A than E. coli-lipid A. We conclude that P. gingivalis-LPS could activate TLR2/4-mediated NF-kappa B/STAT3 signaling pathways, which ultimately resulted in an immune-inflammatory response in BV-2 microglia. In contrast to E. coli-LPS, P. gingivalis-LPS is a weaker TLR2/4 agonist and NF-kappa B/STAT3 signaling activator. Furthermore, the different fatty acid chains and phosphate groups between P. gingivalis-lipid A and E. coli-lipid A may be the reason for the weaker activating properties of P. gingivalis-LPS."
Longitudinal associations between different dementia diagnoses and medication use jointly accounting for dropout,INTERNATIONAL PSYCHOGERIATRICS,"Background: Longitudinal studies of older adults are characterized by high dropout rates, multimorbid conditions, and multiple medication use, especially proximal to death. We studied the association between multiple medication use and incident dementia diagnoses including Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD), and Lewy-body dementia (LBD), simultaneously accounting for dropout. Methods: Using the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center data with three years of follow-up, a set of covariate-adjusted models that ignore dropout was fit to complete-case data, and to the whole-cohort data. Additionally, covariate-adjusted joint models with shared random effects accounting for dropout were fit to the whole-cohort data. Multiple medication use was defined as polypharmacy (>= five medications), hyperpolypharmacy (>= ten medications), and total number of medications. Results: Incident diagnoses were 2,032 for AD, 135 for VD, and 139 for LBD. Percentages of dropout at the end of follow-up were as follows: 71.8% for AD, 81.5% for VD, and 77.7% for LBD. The odds ratio (OR) estimate for hyperpolypharmacy among those with LBD versus AD was 2.19 (0.78, 6.15) when estimated using complete-case data and 3.00 (1.66, 5.40) using whole-cohort data. The OR reduced to 1.41 (0.76, 2.64) when estimated from the joint model accounting for dropout. The OR for polypharmacy using complete-case data differed from the estimates using whole-cohort data. The OR for dementia diagnoses on total number of medications was similar, but non-significant when estimated using complete-case data. Conclusion: Reasons for dropout should be investigated and appropriate statistical methods should be applied to reduce bias in longitudinal studies among high-risk dementia cohorts."
"New Variant of MELAS Syndrome With Executive Dysfunction, Heteroplasmic Point Mutation in the MT-ND4 Gene (m.12015T>C; p.Leu419Pro) and Comorbid Polyglandular Autoimmune Syndrome Type 2",FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY,"Background: Mitochondrial diseases are caused by dysfunctions in mitochondrial metabolic pathways. MELAS syndrome is one of the most frequent mitochondrial disorders; it is characterized by encephalopathy, myopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes. Typically, it is associated with a point mutation with an adenine-to-guanine transition at position 3243 of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA; m.3243A>G) in the mitochondrially encoded tRNA leucine 1 (MT-TL1) gene. Other point mutations are possible and the association with polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type 2 has not yet been described. Case presentation: We present the case of a 25-year-old female patient with dysexecutive syndrome, muscular fatigue, and continuous headache. Half a year ago, she fought an infection-triggered Addison crisis. As the disease progressed, she had two epileptic seizures and stroke-like episodes with hemiparesis on the right side. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging showed a substance defect of the parieto-occipital left side exceeding the vascular territories with a lactate peak. The lactate ischemia test was clearly positive, and a muscle biopsy showed single cytochrome c oxidase-negative muscle fibers. Genetic testing of blood mtDNA revealed a heteroplasmic base exchange mutation in the mitochondrially encoded NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit 4 (MT-ND4) gene (m.12015T>C; p.Leu419Pro; heteroplasmy level in blood 12%, in muscle tissue: 15%). The patient suffered from comorbid autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 2 with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Addison's disease, and autoimmune gastritis. In addition, we found increased anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase 65, anti-partial cell, anti-intrinsic factor, and anti-nuclear antibodies. Conclusion: We present an atypical case of MELAS syndrome with predominant symptoms of a dysexecutive syndrome, two stroke-like episodes, and fast-onset fatigue. The symptoms were associated with a not yet described base and aminoacid exchange mutation in the MT-ND4 gene (m.12015T>C to p.Leu419Pro). The resulting changed protein complex in our patient is part of the respiratory chain multicomplex I and might be the reason for the mitochondriopathy. However, different simulations for pathogenetic relevance are contradictory and rather speak for a benign variant. To our knowledge this case report is the first reporting MELAS syndrome with comorbid polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type 2. Screening for autoimmune alterations in those patients is important to prevent damage to end organs."
Theoretical and Empirical Efficiency of Sampling Strategies for Estimating Upper Arm Elevation,ANNALS OF OCCUPATIONAL HYGIENE,"Objectives: To investigate the statistical efficiency of strategies for sampling upper arm elevation data, which differed with respect to sample sizes and sample allocations within and across measurement days. The study was also designed to compare standard theoretical predictions of sampling efficiency, which rely on several assumptions about the data structure, with 'true' efficiency as determined by bootstrap simulations. Methods: Sixty-five sampling strategies were investigated using a data set containing minute-by-minute values of average right upper arm elevation, percentage of time with an arm elevated <15 degrees, and percentage of time with an arm elevated >90 degrees in a population of 23 house painters, 23 car mechanics, and 26 machinists, all followed for four full working days. Total sample times per subject between 30 and 240 min were subdivided into continuous time blocks between 1 and 240 min long, allocated to 1 or 4 days per subject. Within day(s), blocks were distributed using either a random or a fixed-interval principle. Sampling efficiency was expressed in terms of the variance of estimated mean exposure values of 20 subjects and assessed using standard theoretical models assuming independence between variables and homoscedasticity. Theoretical performance was compared to empirical efficiencies obtained by a nonparametric bootstrapping procedure. Results: We found the assumptions of independence and homoscedasticity in the theoretical model to be violated, most notably expressed through an autocorrelation between measurement units within working days. The empirical variance of the mean exposure estimates decreased, i.e. sampling efficiency increased, for sampling strategies where measurements were distributed widely across time. Thus, the most efficient allocation strategy was to organize a sample into 1-min block collected at fixed time intervals across 4 days. Theoretical estimates of efficiency generally agreed with empirical variances if the sample was allocated into small blocks, while for larger block sizes, the empirical 'true' variance was considerably larger than predicted by theory. Theory overestimated efficiency in particular for strategies with short total sample times per subject. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that when exposure data are autocorrelated within days which we argue is the major reason why theory overestimates sampling performance-sampling efficiency can be improved by distributing the sample widely across the day or across days, preferably using a fixed-interval strategy. While this guidance is particularly valid when small proportions of working days are assessed, we generally recommend collecting more data than suggested by theory if a certain precision of the resulting exposure estimate is needed. More data per se give a better precision and sampling larger proportion(s) of the working day(s) also alleviate the negative effects of possible autocorrelation in data."
Risk Factors Associated with Inadequate Bowel Preparation in Patients with Functional Constipation,DIGESTIVE DISEASES AND SCIENCES,"Background Constipation is a common reason of poor bowel preparation, which negatively influences the quality of colonoscopy. Risk factors for inadequate bowel preparation in constipated patients remain unclear. Aims This study aimed to investigate the high-risk factors that might influence the quality of bowel preparation in patients with functional constipation. Methods Consecutive patients with functional constipation who underwent colonoscopy between June 2016 and April 2017 were enrolled. A standard split dose of 4 l polyethylene glycol was used for bowel preparation. Patient- and procedure-related parameters were recorded. The primary outcome was an adequate rate of bowel preparation. Risk factors for inadequate bowel preparation were screened by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results A total of 199 patients were included. Adequate bowel preparation was found in 62.8% (125/199) of patients. At multivariate analysis, Bristol stool form scale (BSFS) 1 [odds ratio (OR) 2.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-5.90; P = 0.011], rectal pain score during defecation < 2 (OR 4.14, 95% CI 1.22-13.97; P = 0.022), and starting-to-defecation interval >= 4 h (OR 3.83, 95% CI 1.34-10.91; P = 0.012) were risk factors for inadequate bowel preparation in patients with constipation. For patients with no, 1, 2, or 3 risk factors, the rates of inadequate bowel preparation were 11%, 23%, 49%, and 65%, respectively. Conclusions With the standard preparation regime, > 1/3 of patients with functional constipation had inadequate bowel cleansing. BSFS 1, rectal pain score during defecation < 2, and starting-to-defecation interval >= 4 h were identified as independent risk factors for inadequate bowel preparation in constipated patients."
A mild ovarian stimulation strategy in women with poor ovarian reserve undergoing IVF: a multicenter randomized non-inferiority trial,HUMAN REPRODUCTION,"STUDY QUESTION: In subfertile women with poor ovarian reserve undergoing IVF does a mild ovarian stimulation strategy lead to comparable ongoing pregnancy rates in comparison to a conventional ovarian stimulation strategy? SUMMARY ANSWER: A mild ovarian stimulation strategy in women with poor ovarian reserve undergoing IVF leads to similar ongoing pregnancy rates as a conventional ovarian stimulation strategy. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Women diagnosed with poor ovarian reserve are treated with a conventional ovarian stimulation strategy consisting of high-dose gonadotropins and pituitary downregulation with a long mid-luteal start GnRH-agonist protocol. Previous studies comparing a conventional strategy with a mild ovarian stimulation strategy consisting of low-dose gonadotropins and pituitary downregulation with a GnRH-antagonist have been under powered and their effectiveness is inconclusive. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This open label multicenter randomized trial was designed to compare one cycle of a mild ovarian stimulation strategy consisting of low-dose gonadotropins (150 IU FSH) and pituitary downregulation with a GnRH-antagonist to one cycle of a conventional ovarian stimulation strategy consisting of high-dose gonadotropins (450 IU HMG) and pituitary downregulation with a long mid-luteal GnRH-agonist in women of advanced maternal age and/or women with poor ovarian reserve undergoing IVF between May 2011 and April 2014. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Couples seeking infertility treatment were eligible if they fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: female age >= 35 years, a raised basal FSH level > 10 IU/ml irrespective of age, a low antral follicular count of <= 5 follicles or poor ovarian response or cycle cancellation during a previous IVF cycle irrespective of age. The primary outcome was ongoing pregnancy rate per woman randomized. Analyses were on an intention-to-treat basis. We randomly assigned 195 women to the mild ovarian stimulation strategy and 199 women to the conventional ovarian stimulation strategy. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Ongoing pregnancy rate was 12.8% (25/195) for mild ovarian stimulation versus 13.6% (27/199) for conventional ovarian stimulation leading to a risk ratio of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.57-1.57), representing an absolute difference of -0.7% (95% CI: -7.4 to 5.9). This 95% CI does not extend below the predefined threshold of 10% for inferiority. The duration of ovarian stimulation was significantly lower in the mild ovarian stimulation strategy than in the conventional ovarian stimulation strategy (mean difference -1.2 days, 95% CI: -1.88 to -0.62). Also, a significantly lower amount of gonadotropins was used in the mild simulation strategy, with a mean difference of 3135 IU (95% CI: -3331 to -2940). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: A limitation of our study was the lack of data concerning the cryopreservation of surplus embryos, so we are not informed on cumulative pregnancy rates. Another limitation is that we were not able to follow up on the ongoing pregnancies in all centers, so we are not informed on live birth rates. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The results are directly applicable in daily clinical practice and may lead to considerable cost savings as high dosages of gonadotropins are not necessary in women with poor ovarian reserve undergoing IVF. A health economic analysis of our data planned to test the hypothesis that mild ovarian stimulation strategy is more cost-effective than the conventional ovarian stimulation strategy is underway."
Assessing the feasibility and effectiveness of household-pooled universal testing to control COVID-19 epidemics,PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY,"Outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 are threatening the health care systems of several countries around the world. The initial control of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics relied on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, teleworking, mouth masks and contact tracing. However, as pre-symptomatic transmission remains an important driver of the epidemic, contact tracing efforts struggle to fully control SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. Therefore, in this work, we investigate to what extent the use of universal testing, i.e., an approach in which we screen the entire population, can be utilized to mitigate this epidemic. To this end, we rely on PCR test pooling of individuals that belong to the same households, to allow for a universal testing procedure that is feasible with the limited testing capacity. We evaluate two isolation strategies: on the one hand pool isolation, where we isolate all individuals that belong to a positive PCR test pool, and on the other hand individual isolation, where we determine which of the individuals that belong to the positive PCR pool are positive, through an additional testing step. We evaluate this universal testing approach in the STRIDE individual-based epidemiological model in the context of the Belgian COVID-19 epidemic. As the organisation of universal testing will be challenging, we discuss the different aspects related to sample extraction and PCR testing, to demonstrate the feasibility of universal testing when a decentralized testing approach is used. We show through simulation, that weekly universal testing is able to control the epidemic, even when many of the contact reductions are relieved. Finally, our model shows that the use of universal testing in combination with stringent contact reductions could be considered as a strategy to eradicate the virus. Author summary As pre-symptomatic transmission is an important driver of COVID-19 epidemics (i.e., the virus is transmitted before the infected individual is aware of its infection), contact tracing efforts struggle to fully control SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. For this reason, the use of universal testing, where each individual of the community is tested on a regular basis, has been suggested. However, the large amount of PCR tests that is required to facilitate this approach, remains an important impediment. Therefore, we propose a new universal testing procedure that is feasible with the current testing capacity, where we rely on PCR test pooling of individuals that belong to the same households. We evaluate this universal testing procedure in a fine-grained epidemiological model (i.e., an individual-based model) that covers the Belgian population. Through this evaluation, we assess the procedure's performance to keep the epidemic under control, while allowing for various contact reductions. We assess the robustness of the model, by analysing different levels of community compliance, and we show that weekly universal testing could prove a successful strategy to control SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks."
In silico prediction of ADME and pharmacokinetics - Report of an expert meeting organised by COST B15,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES,"The computational approach is one of the newest and fastest developing techniques in pharmacokinetics, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) evaluation, drug discovery and toxicity. However, to date, the software packages devoted to ADME prediction, especially of metabolism, have not yet been adequately validated and still require improvements to be effective. Most are 'open' systems, under constant evolution and able to incorporate rapidly, and often easily, new information from user or developer databases. Quantitative in silico predictions are now possible for several pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, particularly absorption and distribution. The emerging consensus is that the predictions are no worse than those made using in vitro tests, with the decisive advantage that much less investment in technology, resources and time is needed. In addition, and of critical importance, it is possible to screen virtual compounds. Some packages are able to handle thousands of molecules in a few hours. However, common experience shows that, in part at least for essentially irrational reasons, there is currently a lack of confidence in these approaches. An effort should be made by the software producers towards more transparency, in order to improve the confidence of their consumers. It seems highly probable that in silico approaches will evolve rapidly, as did in vitro methods during the last decade. Past experience with the latter should be helpful in avoiding repetition of similar errors and in taking the necessary steps to ensure effective implementation. A general concern is the lack of access to the large amounts of data on compounds no longer in development, but still kept secret by the pharmaceutical industry. Controlled access to these data could be particularly helpful in validating new in silico approaches. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."
