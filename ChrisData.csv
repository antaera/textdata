"I have a bi racial  who attended AnonSchool  and I was warned first not to let her go to AnonSchool  by a number of parents because it was allegedly widely known for its racist atmosphere. We decided to try it anyway. I was shocked and disgusted by what she told me about how she was treated solely because of her race. After she went, I was then repeatedly warned by many white parents not to have her take math from a certain teacher, history from another teacher, etc because they were racist. If certain teachers there are so racist and known to be racist by even white parents, there have obviously been complaints against them and administration knows. Why are they still working there? My daughter never had any of those teachers while she was there and we eventually moved her to another   but what she did experience from  while she was at AnonSchool  was something no teen should have to endure. No wonder it goes on, behavior like that is allowed. Good, strong leadership would minimize, if not put an end to it. If administration allows racist teacher to continue to teach our  and administration fails to act that signals the  that it is fine to be racist. If administration took a hard stand against racism (and not just the weak ‘no place for hate’ stuff which did little to help as racist found it laughable), and dealt harshly with staff who are racists I suspect that the atmosphere would quickly change and at the very least the racist would keep their racist views to themselves. That a number of parents warned me against sending my daughter to a   because of known racism (and unfortunately we found that to be a valid warning) and about specific teachers, programs and clubs while she was there, is an outrage. How has this been allowed to continue?  -AnonSchool   Parent"

"As our username states, this page was dedicated to the black experience in PUSD to light racism in our community. Somehow this turned into a page for every social issue there is, and we started allowing things like LGBT issues, ableism, and anti semitism to come into discussion. At first we felt the need to post these things because they are extremely important and we agree on creating an inclusive environment. But in reality, we can't tackle all issues at once. It’s too much for one account to handle.  There have been multiple accounts popping up with different social issues going on in PUSD. We like that these conversations are being sparked about how to improve the district. But, you have to realize that if PUSD becomes overwhelmed with all these issues at once, they won’t tackle any of them and instead turn it into one big inclusivity campaign. With all these pages coming out after ours, we don’t want this to become a “trend”. Ideally, we'd prefer if these pages came out at different times so PUSD could address them individually and in depth. Doing so now takes away from what we’re trying to accomplish at the moment and ultimately feels like black voices are being overshadowed.  With that being said, we cannot tackle every social issue there is because we would get nowhere. Our main intent with this account was to give the largely outnumbered black population a voice that we never had. We want to thank everyone for their unwavering support, but now want to state firmly that the only issue we will tackle on this account is racism. Focusing on one issue at a time sparks change. We will continue posting submissions that strictly deal with racism from black  AND other races because it falls in line with our focus. Thank you for understanding."

Our pole vault coach, who still works there btw, was 100% aware of these comments, and never punished my teammates, so I personally went to DN's athletic director myself to complain, whose efforts to address this behavior were minimal, lackluster, & insulting. I felt so unsupported by my coach throughout my tenure on the pole vault team, and it even got to the point where he eventually wouldn't address me, the only black person on the team, while he would be so excited to see my other non-black teammates at practice.

There’s better, less aggressive ways to word that, if you wanna know my ethnicity ask “what’s your ethnicity?” “Or what cultures do you participate in?” Asking where I'm from and getting upset when I tell you it’s America is annoying and dumb because you’re assuming I wasn’t born here thus I’m not truly American. Our country’s vision of what American looks like shouldn’t be a white person or an english name. Furthermore, when I tell you how to pronounce my name, get it right. Idc if you gotta practice but show me the same respect that someone named Rebecca or Jake, etc would get. My blood would boil when teachers would be like “oh no I’m gonna butcher this name” then I’d correct them 10 times and write out the phonetic pronunciation on the roll sheet for them and they’d STILL butcher it. It felt purposeful and like addressing me with respect was too much work and didn’t matter because I’m different, even though i made it easy for them.

"I had a friend in   who was white & thought it was okay to say the n-word if it was in a song. When I called her out on it, she got offended and acted like I was trying to hurt her feelings. I don’t understand why white/ non-black  want to say the n-word so badly. If you’re not black, you cannot say it under any circumstances. -Rancho Bernardo  , ‘18"
"So even though I am not black this is still an experience of racism. I feel bad as it is not negatively affecting me but it still bothers me.  So I am mixed race but i look veryyyyyy pale. With this I get a lot of privilege. I have many friends of many races but i would say my closest friends primarily mexican/hispanic and black. It is DISGUSTING how many times I have talked to someone (usually white) and they are so nice and respectful to me but then moments later are so cruel and disrespectful to POC or even my own friends in front of my face.  In a somewhat recent event (outside of my ) i experienced this same kind of thing but at a cafe with a white waiter. I called her out on it and she said “what do you care, you are white” I was in shock. It is so gross how shallow  can be. -MCHS, ‘22"
"I was in math class and one kid in the class was trying to pressure another kid to say the N word around me since he loves to say it so much around his white friends. The guy looked at me and said he wouldn’t say it around me because I “looked like I’d beat the crap out of him” if he did. That same kid goes around calling his black “friends” and other POC’s the N word with the hard r. I just think it’s absolute BS that in order to have a somewhat normal experience at WV, the kids have to find you intimidating or scary. I don't want  to be intimidated by me, but if they weren’t, I know for a fact that they’d walk around calling me racial slurs to my face.  -Westview  , ‘21"
"We were performing self written monologues in class and a white  went up and did a performance impersonating a Mexican ""Illegal Immigrant"". Her monologue was full of ""taking your jobs"" and ""bringing my family in the trunk"". She was not only allowed to finish it, but then the whole class left the only two Latinx  (myself and a very shy ) to give her feedback. I am proud of my Latinx heritage, but I'm a white passing Salvadorian. To this day I wish I'd had the words to explain why this was wrong.

My teacher told everyone that there is a new kid in his class (me). He introduced me to the whole class, made me stand up and asked me where I was from. I told him and the whole class the history of my island and that my island is a US territory. This supposedly “social studies” teacher had the audacity to ask me why I was so “good” at speaking english as if I didn’t tell whole class the history of where I came from.

He was shocked and didn't know what to do so he just ignored the kids. He didn't want to make a big deal about it and brushed it off but i knew it bothered him a lot. Although we got a phone call from the VP about the incident, she didn’t seem to be taking it as a serious matter by saying that it was just an “internet prank.” As a parent, we were appalled that no disciplinary measures were put upon the  and what’s more disturbing is that it all happened during black history month.  -Oak Valley Middle  Parent"

"Although there have been positive comments made towards the rbhs dance director M[censored], she isn’t 100% innocent. As a dancer on one of the teams in rb, I’ve witnessed her say the n word (with the er) in attempt to make sure we keep that word out of the songs that we perform. I know many  will say, “she doesn't mean it like that” or “she’s trying to make sure the word isn’t included in the songs” but is it so hard to say “ the n word” without actually having to say it?  ~Rancho Bernardo, ‘21"

Another day he said “Hey, We have the same pair of shoes on! Only problem is I bought mine and you stole yours"". His comments continued throughout  . I could go on and on. I never thought they were funny. If I said something, would I have been benched? They could have used something else as an excuse to bench me. Can you imagine the dilemma and disrespect I felt?

"I am a former Westview Latinx  heard plenty of “lighthearted"" harassment about “being such a white-washed Mexican.” However, the worse racial incident I remember was  harassing this new black  we got and asking him if he was pretending to be a Nigerian prince who scammed  for money. He was kind and sincere and just went along with all of the remarks pretending like it didn't bother him. I drove him home once when we were in community college together and he told me how hard it really was to hear all of the jokes about him, and I’m sure that wasn’t the extent of the experience, but just the tip of the iceberg. It’s not easy being a person of color in this district.  -Westivew  , ‘09"

"I'd like to clarify some things for educational purposes. Stop assuming that it is a mixed/non- black thing to have straight or blonde hair or eyes that aren't brown.

There are black  that aren't called ""African American"" Not all of us are American or African. Some of us are Pacific Islanders, Carribeans, Latinos, and more and not because we’re mixed. Saying we don't look ""hispanic"" when Afro-Latinos exist or thinking that because my features aren't what YOU perceive as black feautures makes me ""exotic"" or ""I must be mixed"" is a HUGE INSULT. As well as when you find out that I'm Native and other things, and thinking that I've proved/validated your point. Go out and travel or watch movies/read books about places other than Europe. Meet/date different . That way y'all won't be so shock to learn that Hispanic doesn‘t mean Latino. I had a teacher try to tell me that because my ancestors are African I am African, and that me wanting to just be called black sounds offensive because race is a social construct that is not tied to someone's identity. I as a black American I don't prefer to be called African American because I'm a fourth generation American with no ties to my African ancestors] culture as well as an American Indian with ancestors that were here first. I won't claim something I wasn't brought up in because I feel that's offensive to actual African  who live the African experience.  -Rancho Bernardo  , ‘19"
"When I was young, a few boys in the class picked on me because I was not the same color as them. I was choked and was constantly made fun of.

"Can we talk about history/social studies classes have kids make jokes which are microaggressions that lead to racism? In 7th grade social studies, we were talking about African history before the Europeans colonized it and there's this one country called Niger, and many  poke fun at that name. Kids would however not pronounce it the way it's supposed to be pronounced, ""nee-jehr"" which is French because the French colonized Niger, but instead, they would pronounce it as ""ni**er"". Once we were talking about African masks and one boy said ""that looks like an ape!"" Forward to 8th grade social studies, which is American history,  would whisper and point at me when slavery was mentioned. When we learned slaves picked cotton, kids would ask ""did your ancestors pick cotton."" They did, but these kids would poke fun of it and stated their ancestors owner my ancestors and it was triggering because they were poking fun at history of something my ancestors did and is something I'm lucky I don't have to endure, the long labor and mistreatment. Kids would also say they wish they owned slaves.  -Black Mountain Middle , ‘14"
"I don’t know why kids think it's okay to hate on other cultures. One time in second or third grade, I was giving an academic presentation on my Arab culture. When I changed into my traditional Arab clothes, kids were whispering next to each other, but all I could hear was “he’s wearing a dress.” I also taught them some Arabic words, and one of them asked “why do they look like squiggles"" and compared it to his parent’s signature. When I brought out the food and told them the names of the foods and what was in them, they would mock the pronunciations and say “ewwww, that's disgusting”. Thankfully, my teacher stood up for me and told those kids it was extremely disrespectful and gave us a good talking of why we should show respect and be considerate to everyone's culture and how it would feel if someone came to their house and disrespected everything. However, one of the kids seemed to not care and came up to me after  and said “why did you dress up like those guys on TV, you looked like you had a bomb on you” however, I laughed it off because I didn’t understand racial stereotypes at that time.  -Willow Grove Elementary , ‘24"

I wanted to discuss an important matter with her one time and she did not look me in the eye once, faced away from me, and took out her nail clipper and proceeded to clip her nails. At tutorial, I would patiently wait with other  to get my questions answered and she would prioritize white  first, not by order of walking in to tutorial.

"I'd like to start off by saying that I used to be one of those  who thought racism was just purely an outward expression; As long as I don't actively demean  who aren't like me and I treat everyone the same regardless of skin color I'm not racist right? As a result, I used to be one of those  who believed in ""All Lives Matter"" instead of ""Black Lives Matter"" when the movement first started gaining momentum in the early 2010s and didn't think it was problematic. I didn‘t fully recognize that I was racist until my junior year when I was introduced to a black girl by a friend of mine and the first thought I had was ""I shouldn‘t be friends with those kinds of  because my mom would never approve of it"". I was extremely shocked that it was a belief that I held at the time and it forced me to examine my internal racism. Looking back, I realized that my way of thinking is a product of general anti- blackness in our community from the way many asian parents think of black  as ”stealing opportunities from our kids"" to the way that my family trash talk blacks and other POC as being ""lazy criminals"". This movement is important because it forces us to recognize that racism isn't just an issue that  face outwardly; it's also requires looking inward by examine your bias and privilege. Since then, I've been educating myself, understanding my privilege, and sharing resources so that others can do the same. Now, I understand why Black Lives Matter and I'm proud to now call myself an ally.

"A walk from the classroom to the cafeteria at my  will demonstrate how racism is here to stay. In any  , for that matter, racism is just another topic that is kicked down the road.

"I'm not black, but the young man I'm going to talk about is. In fourth grade, I was at a table with a boy (black) who had unfortunately had a bad reputation (not the point).

I grew incredibly frustrated and angry, lost control of my emotions, and stabbed his hand with my pen (luckily it did not break his skin, and, again, I cannot begin to describe how horrified I am at the memory). The shocking thing is that the teacher decided to punish the boy, not me. He was sent to the principal's office, got a one-day suspension, and had to write an apology letter to me, even though he had done nothing wrong. All I got was a 15 minute time-out in the corner of the classroom, a sign-in, and I was asked to write an apology letter to him. The point of this story is to light the fact that the teacher (an old white woman who didn‘t like this boy anyway) gave him, the victim, a far worse punishment than the one I, an asian spoiled brat and teacher's pet, received little-to-no punishment.

English. my teacher suggested using a quote from To Kill a Mockingbird that included the n-word for uy essay. I told than I didn't feel comfortable using it. (especially as a person who has been a target of the slur because sone  group all dark skinned  together). The teacher responded by saying I was overreacting and it was silly for no to get upset by it. I told the: I wasn't going to use that quote regardless of if it‘s dumb for me to be upset, but I remember being afraid at how ignorant  are to racise and the history behind the slur.  I hear so many (non-black) kids saying the n-word without reservations around their friends and laugh about it.  After coronavirus became more known to America, I saw  in the halls backing away from east Asians and saying things like ""don't cone close, we don't want corona‘. There were teachers who saw and didn‘t care.  There's honestly so many more things I've noticed just from a distance as a bystander. I hate that I was always too scared to say something to , and the few tines I did I was inuediately shut down and reinforced the inherent racisa in the system, and how it was futile to expect anything to change.  -Hestview  , ‘22"
"In middle  I had a teacher who would say some pretty questionable things.

He would always say how a great guy he was and how he never did anything wrong. When literally he was 3 HISTORY teacher. He also made his political views very, very clear. I remember the day trump got elected he was expressing with a  how happy he was. I don't really care what political side your on. But for a teacher I think it's very inappropriate to talk about that so much. He also lectured the class multiple times on how bad it was to not believe in God. Like WT???? That's not something you should be saying in a public . Another thing is that a couple days after trump got a elected  were protesting against. He brought that up in the class and said how it was bad that was to do and to just follow the law. Which then a  called him out on it and brought up protests made for the rights of black  and how segregation was legal back then. Lastly in during class their were times when we had to straighten our desk. While the class was doing that this teacher would always say “straight is the only way” in such a tone that made me so uncomfortable. Although I can’t say that made him homophobic.

I witnessed some white  openly texting while a certain teacher was talking to the class. Not a word.

"Towards the beginning of my junior year, I was taking APEL with a teacher who was very vocal about her political views. At one point for homework, she assigned a reading response and wrote an introductory sentence on the board for us to copy because she wanted us to use it in our assignment. A few days after I had turned in the assignment online, I noticed she had left a comment saying it's interesting how I used the same opening sentence as my good friend (who happened to be one of the only other Hispanics in the class), essentially accusing us of copying off of each other. Fearing that I had misunderstood, I asked some of my other classmates about their assignments and they had all used the same sentence as well and no one else had received similar comments on their work. She never addressed it in class, which leads me to wonder if she was just trying to justify taking points off of my assignment. I have always been a good  and have never been accused of cheating in my life. My parents went to the  about it and they only gave me the options to either stay in the class or switch teachers, which meant switching my schedule around and sacrificing practice time for my sport.  -Rancho Bernardo  , 19"

"One day in PE, our teacher instructed everyone to get into groups of 2-3. After reorganizing ourselves, the teacher told us to come up with team names among our groups. He walked over to my friend's group (3 Chinese kids) and cheerily said ""For example, you guys could be 'Team North Korea'."" Everyone in the class gasped, even the whitest kids. Then to add insult to injury, he walked over to the group sitting next to my friends (3 Indian kids) and said ""And you guys could be 'Team China'!"" The teacher had the biggest grin on his face as if he was proud of the clever joke he had just made, but everyone in the class just gaped at him in disbelief. The teacher looked around hoping there would be some laughs, but when he saw none he quickly shut up and moved on, making the situation even more awkward. For the rest of the day, I told all my friends about the scenario, hoping I wasn't the only that thought this was bizarre. To my relief, everyone who heard the story instinctively had the same reaction of disgust. But the saddest fact is, when I told one of my friends what had happened, she told me that she was in the class preceding mine and he had made the same exact remark to a group of Chinese kids and a group of Indian kids sitting next to them. She told me that every one of the  in her class had the same reaction of confusion and disgust. I really don't understand what prompted this teacher to make this joke, not once, but TWICE! I mean, if this teacher said this one time without thinking, there‘s some serious conversations to be had and self-reflection to be made, but I think saying this once is redeemable. The fact that this teacher did this TWO TIMES both without getting a single  to laugh shows that the teacher knew what he said was wrong, but was still insistent on making this insensitive comment.  -Del Norte, ‘19"

Classmates and  I believed to be friends"", called me names like fro, fluffy, mufasa, and niglet. In middle  I tried sticking up for myself after being teased on the bus rides home, daily. Unfortunately however, I was unsuccessful after taking it to the principal and was told to just ignore it. Going forward, for years I tried to laugh it off and believed that if I was able to laugh at it, it would stop. It didn’t. Classmates would even stick pencils and other objects in my hair and see how many class periods it would stay in place before I found it or it would fall out. I did my best to keep it to myself, but all it did was make me hate myself. I hated my ethnic islander hair, I felt ugly, I felt unworthy, I felt ashamed, I even hated myself some times. I went through different hair treatments trying to change the proteins in my hair to make it straight, burning my scalp in the process leaving me with painful blisters and scabs. I was a varsity athlete but my grade in P.E. class suffered for a period of time as well because I was afraid to get my hair wet in the pool, fear of my curls coming back, and the jokes that would ensue. The only person I could really trust with loving ME, and making me feel ""safe"", was my   sweetheart. Things never got better, until after I graduated and met other  with hair similar to mine, and was out of the environment with  who we’re ignorant to the identity of my hair. I am almost 30 years old and because of all the teasing I experienced, I am still learning to love myself and my hair.  -Former AnonSchool "

"It all began in 2010 when I started going to Oak Valley Middle from Westwood Elementary. Even in Westwood I was uncomfortable but there were many other kids like me and everyone was cool with each other. I remember being called chi Chi as in a Chia pet because I had a Afro. Which I didn't really mind because I liked the attention and friends but never did it cross my mind that I was almost being exploited for my looks till 7TH grade year. I cut my hair over summer while being grounded for grades then when I came back my classmates were a bit different. Everyone kind of was standoffish but I didn't pay it any mind. Then towards Dec I heard  saying things about me like ""he's a gorilla“, ”they won't let blacky on the DW basketball youth team”, dirty looks in the hallways, upperclasssen bullying me, and a bunch other things. Then I SWAPPED. I was a victim turned aggressor. Whoever looked at me wrong I would get angry to protect myself from the around the clock attacks. A kid called me a monkey then threw a banana. I knocked it Out the air and threw it back. Long story short I ended up cuffed to a chair in the back office of OAK VALLEY MIDDLE SCHOOL FOR A HR AWE WITH NO PARENT AT 11 YEARS OLD. That's not where it ended. The Vice Principal even texting all 20 of my friends and telling them I do drugs and to keep their kids away from me. For the remainder of those 2 years I had 2 friends after being friends with half the . I sat alone at lunch. Sad at home. So much pain I still think about today. It only got worse at Del Norte."
"I don’t know what to think about this  anymore. I walk through the halls and the n word is language used commonly around the .

What really hurts about this is that to my knowledge, the  has not done anything to stop any of this. They sent out an email to the parents but we all know this won’t change a thing. If PUSD really is a place for no hate, they wouldn’t tolerate behavior like this at their . The fact that this man gets to stay at our  and walk the same halls as me sickens me and downright scares me.

He claimed that he had learned about Muslims in his history class at AnonSchool  (he seemed to think this made him an irrefutable expert in all things Islam) and that he was taught by his history teacher at AnonSchool  that all Muslims hate all gays. I don’t even know which class teaches about Muslims cause I sure don't remember learning about religion at AnonSchool , but either way this means that  are leaving from AnonSchool  learning that Muslims are hateful towards others which is straight up not true and allows  to generalize and hate in turn.  -AnonSchool  , ‘20"

It still baffles me to this day, because they never had as hard of a time differentiating between the majority of white , many of whom ACTUALLY had the same/similar names. The feeling of not being respected enough by my teachers to be remembered by my own name was incredibly demoralizing for me, and it set a horrible example for my fellow classmates who did not have to experience this.  -Black Mountain Middle , ‘15"

I am not Muslim, and even if I was, this would not be acceptable. If I ever raised any objection, he would chastise me for not being “chill” or for not being able to take a joke. As a result, I thought this time of greeting was funny and normal and okay and appropriate, despite it being far from any of those things.

After full lunch hour of bullying, we returned to class, and the homeroom teacher, K*** H**** started explaining what a terrorist was. ""Middle Eastern descent” was used in the definition. This was a prime example of PUSD teachers demonizing  of Middle Eastern and South Asian descent by likening us to terrorists. This provided mostly young white boys with the license to bully us as much as they wanted to without much more than a slap on the wrist. This is the same psychological conditioning that has implored white adult males to shoot up Sikh temples, target South Asians for violent attacks and even kill them at bars (2017 Olathe, Kansas shooting).

Throughout the year, many other Middle Eastern/Muslim  were bullied. South Asian  were harassed too because many  seem to not understand the difference between Hinduism and Islam or South Asian culture and Middle Eastern culture. I am getting married soon and also planning to have a child and it is going to be extremely tough telling him/her how I faced discrimination and telling him/her what will happen if my future child faces discrimination too.

The entire class, made up of mostly White and lighter- skinned Asian , laughed. Not one person stopped to question why she was singling him out for something that was out of his control."

More education is good, but how do we ensure that the issues are addressed seriously and treated with respect? PUSD officials and educators must consider the mindset of ignorant  and teachers. You have to treat the root of the problem, not putting on a bandage that is going to fall off with time.  The last thing that I would like to touch up on is the makeup of A88. I will never know what happens in ASB when the doors are closed, but some members have openly support Trump's viewpoints. As a “supposed inclusive” organization that cares for all ’ affairs in AnonSchool , why are these members here? Their social media posts are nothing of being a good  angel of A88. A53 needs to seriously reevaluate its members. This is not just a AnonSchool  problem, and I think other PUSD  s may have this issue. ASB needs to take its leadership seriously, especially if they are aiming at diversity and anti-racism. Other  leadership groups in PUSD  s must address their own internal racism and intolerance, as other posts on this page have pointed out.  -AnonSchool, 2020"

"When my friend and I were reminiscing about events in AnonSchool , suddenly he reminded me about a video that AnonSchool  Titan Ambassadors did about microaggression. It was during junior year, and we have a lesson on microaggression in our homeroom class. A lot of reactions were made about the video. Some  in my homeroom class laughed at it. My homeroom teacher was very stern about keeping the discussion on microaggression serious, yet my classmates don’t take it that seriously. My friend said that it was considered “a meme moment” at the time. At the time, I admit that I am ill-informed about the effects of microaggression because they weren't made against me, but what I find out now is horrifying. It was quite subtle.  Looking back at the video today, the likes to dislikes ratio horrifies me. 18 likes to 35 dislikes (checked on 7/8/2020). Some of the comments on the videos are disappointing to say the least. It hits both of us hard. Why would  use their time and energy to give dislikes on a video that educates AnonSchool  ? Sure, the video may not be as good, but it's a nice educational video. Then it really hits me. The  atmosphere in AnonSchool  truly is intolerant and racist. If the population cannot handle talking about microaggression seriously, then how are they going to handle discussing more serious issues regarding race?"

The white Christian kids used the Bible to justify all kinds of cruel opinions. I was engaged with punk rock/activism and outspoken about 9-11/Iraq War/LGBTQ rights, making me an easy target. I was accused of trying to ""destroy the institution of marriage and the family unit"", called a ""Satanist"" for not believing in God, and they graduated from calling me a ""hairy monkey"" to ""hairy lesbian!

"As a former Black  in PUSD I have countless stories about the ways in which I was marginalized, harassed by other , assumed to be defiant by teachers and other adults on campus, etc. The racist run-ins that impacted me the most were the ones in which adults questioned my ability to perform academically. Two incidents specifically come to mind. The first was my first day at PUSD, transferring from Sweetwater Union 880 in Chula Vista. When I started at Bernardo Heights, I was placed in a GATE basic ed class, since I had tested into GATE while in elementary . When I met my basic ed teacher for the first time, she said, ""This is a GATE class, are you sure you're in the right place?"" The majority of my interactions with teachers reflected this same bias: that as a Black  I didn't belong in advanced courses. At REES, I had to battle with my counselor every time I was placed in an honors or AP course. I heard a lot of, ""Are you sure you can handle that class; it's pretty tough . . .""

"Westview may be a diverse place, but racism is obviously here and the teachers think it's no problem. s would joke about how I had drugs, but I never did any drugs in my entire life.

I was told by one  that they would call ICE on me and have Donald Trump build the wall to keep us out, but when I told him it wasn't funny, he would tell me to stop being a democrat liberal and that it was only a joke. A joke that isn't funny or original, and it is extremely offensive. He would then say more stereotypical stuff. Racist comments like these aren’t taken seriously and these  who receive punishments that are way too soft. 99% of the time, they don’t learn and continue when they get a verbal warning. My mother has been verbally abused before for speaking “Mexican"" and that she needed to speak “American"". Also, it breaks my heart to see Mexican street vendors getting beat up for no reason. They're trying to make a living, unlike those idiots that bother them and ask for a permit, or just beat them up simply because they’re Mexican. I didn't face a lot of bullying, but seeing the news, I am horrified because black  have been treated much worse at  and how the black and Hispanic communities can‘t get along.

Having no idea what that meant, I went home and asked my parents about it and they were livid. I remember it so well because at the time, I was so confused as to why my parents were so made over a word.

I thought such kids would be nice to hang out with as he would have positive vibes around me. He seemed amicable until things cracked up senior year. One time when I went up to say hi and have a small chat with him, he started coughing and saying “ I’m allergic to Indian ”. I thought he was joking, but this incident happened many times and he started to rain check me and hang out with others. I thought to myself what was wrong with me. Then, I later unfriended him on Instagram and never spoke again.  -Westview  , ‘19"
"Whenever we had group presentations or projects in world history class,  would “help"" me by doing my part even though I understood the lesson and what event happened. When my teacher realized that I wasn’t doing my part of the assignment because the  in my group were taking over, he docked points off of me. I tried explaining that it was unfair, but I still didn’t get my points back. This wasn’t at all racist, but it was just a microaggresion that stereotypes black  being less smart than white . 08 history class was worse as because of how  would now turn to me and get me to do all the work about slaves. We were searching up pictures for the presentation and a  in my group thought it was funny to compare my face to the slaves on the screen. These little racist comments turned into a big, nasty comments about my skin tone later throughout the year. Throughout  , I never felt that AnonSchool  was a safe environment and that I was constantly judged and bullied due to my skin color, inside of class and outside of class.  -AnonSchool  , ‘15"
"Additional Comments:  once again, i don't know if her intentions were to offend anyone purposely, but nonetheless, some of my asian friends and i see it as an act of cultural appropriation and ignorance towards past racism."
"i want to start about how racism towards asian americans is so normalized and  say that we are overreacting and it's just a harmless joke. in reality, it is still racism towards asians. i have not directly experienced racism myself but some asians have, and any trend that makes  feel uncomfortable or fetishized about their race or culture shouldn't be promoted at all.  may see it as harmless because they've had the privilege of not having to deal with discrimination. this doesn’t make the feelings of asians who are offended by it any less valid. anyways, this girl requested to follow me and i noticed that her profile picture was her pulling her eyes back as the ""fox eye"" trend. (she now changed her profile picture) i accepted her request and followed her back and i saw that her recent post was another photo of her pulling her eyes back. i don't know she intended it to be racist but the gesture is. i wanted to say that make up look to make it look more fox like is okay but the gesture itself is really offensive because asians have often been mocked for their eye shape. -Westview  , ‘23"
"I never attended  in PUSD. I do have young children that are attending and all these stories make me absolutely sad, discouraged, and fearful for them. As a community we have Covid-l9 to work through while we take every precaution possible for the health of our teachers and . But these stories from PUSD  and faculty are eye opening and concerning. As a POC family, I am concerned that the racial unrest, coupled with this pandemic will bring an onslaught of racist words, actions, and deeds from the  body and faculty. I hope that parents, teachers, , and administrators can lean and depend on each other to make  safe from COVID-19 and racism.  -Sundance Elementary  Parent"
"I have a traditional African name. It took some  and teachers a long time to get it, but that‘s okay as long as you're not making fun of it, but that wasn‘t the case for all . There were  that asked me in a really rude tone ""why didn‘t your parents name you normally” or ""were your parents drunk when they named you"". I was taunted and pointed at by other kids because of my name and how ""weird"" it was. Throughout  ,  still made fun of my skin color and my heritage and would ask very obnoxious and stupid questions about Africa they should probably know the answer to just to bother me and get a reaction out of me. They would also make click noises with their mouths to mock some African languages. To this day, I even have some coworkers laugh at my name. I should get respect for the person I am, not my name.  -Mt. Carmel  , ‘08"
"As a recent Nigerian alum from Westview, I can tell you that African  face several micro aggressions that often go unnoticed. Beyond  and their taunting, we have teachers poking fun at our names. Names that hold significant meaning too. And it doesn't stop at jokes. It's the way that substitute teachers make us feel ostracized as they distort their faces and raise their eyebrows while reading our names for attendance, or when they say “I’m not even gonna try this one, it’s a lot"". HOW DISRESPECTFUL. Yes, not everyone will know how to pronounce your name, but the complete disregard and dismissal of our names and deciding not to attempt a pronunciation at all is just one of the MANY micro aggressions that signal to us that we are not worthy of the same respect as our peers with European names. If you can say Tchaikovsky then you can say my name. And teachers, PLEASE stop referring to Africa as one monogamous entity filled with war and poverty. It is LARGELY inaccurate and feeds stereotypes that make African kids feel bad about their heritage. I am tired of answering ignorant questions about whether or not we have electricity or water “over there”. The answer is 0? COURSE. They even use Instagram, drive luxury cars, and own mansions with pools just like  here. Don’t let the minuscule information that our s teach about Africans give you a false reality of our lives.  -Westview  , ‘19"
"Additional Comments:  If you know me you know that I take pride in my heritage and will never apologize for my long name or who I am. The African Population is small but treat our culture with the same respect you would give a European ."
"Additional Comments:  This proves how eurocentric everything is. Like in history, Native Americans were stripped of their name and were given western names, forced to have more western style haircuts, and weren't able to learn their language and had to learn English. If  can learn how to pronounce Slavic or balkan names, they can surely pronounce African names without butchering it on purpose."
"Additional Comments:  Before you ask, ""do Chinese  really eat dogs?"" The answer is no. It's banned in several cities and is a very old tradition that isn't practiced anymore. It is only practiced by poor  in remote villages in a small part. They don't eat bats either. Bats weren't even sold at the market where COVID-19 was thought to be from and there's no place that serves bats in China. Yeah, even if a small part does eat bats, there's even bat soup restaurants in Florida that is NOT owned by Asian . They also eat alligators in the South and  literally still pick up dead deer ran over by cars and eat them for dinner. It doesn't make sense pointing fingers at a country's eating habits when other countries probably do the same with other exotic animals."
"Racism towards Asian Americans is way too normalized and being Chinese American, I have experienced it, even before the COVID-19 pandemic. I remember one time in elementary , I was often gas lighted with redundant questions about my culture. I just answered them because at that time, I didn't know those were micro aggressions and what they were. I was also asked if I understood other Asian languages because I spoke Mandarin Chinese. It‘s like thinking I can speak German because I speak English because they're both Germanic Indo-European languages. s have also made dog eating jokes and me being good at math, but as you already know, when I told them to stop, I was told to take a joke. This is not how it works. In freshman year, a boy in my math class started pulling his eyes back and started saying ""ching chong"" told me it wasn't racist, but I wasn't cool with that. Then came again with the ""take a joke, stop being so sensitive"". When someone tells you it's racist and not funny, you listen to them. If they say it's racist, it's racist and you listen and stop doing it. When COVID-l9 went on the news, I was taunted with questions like ""did you eat a bat"". I remember I went to use the bathroom and there was one other boy in the hallway walking the opposite way of me and as I was walking toward the bathroom, he held his breath in and put his shirt over the nose trying to avoid me. Before he passed me, he passed another white  and he didn't avoid him. Thankfully, my friend group is multi racial and don't make race jokes, but this  definitely needs to do better. When teachers see  being racially targeted, they don‘t do anything, which normalizes racist behavior and adds on to the problems, but whenever someone is just wearing a hoodie or has earbuds in why does all hell break loose.  -Rancho Bernardo  , ‘21"
